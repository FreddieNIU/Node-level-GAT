A copy of the same can be downloaded here.  In the third quarter, the fund’s performance was in line with the market, but it underperformed year-to-date. During the quarter, the fund fell by 4.64%, net of fees, compared to a 4.88% decline for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index benchmark.

Headquartered in Westlake, Texas, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a financial services company. On October 18, 2022, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock closed at $68.61 per share.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $130.159 billion.Here is what Giverny Capital specifically said about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also own The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which earns nearly all its income from the spread it earns between the minuscule rate it pays on cash balances held in brokerage accounts and the yield it can earn investing that cash in fixed income securities or lending those balances via Schwab Bank. Schwab is down about 12% through September. That is better than the market but not great, especially considering the consensus of Wall Street analysts says Schwab should earn $4 per share this year and nearly $5 next year. The stock trades for $75. This is a dominant franchise with consumer trust – Schwab grows brokerage accounts by about 6% per year – and a low-cost expense structure, trading attractively.Altogether, we have not gotten the benefit I expected from our exposure to higher rates.

3,bd297c08-a225-35b1-9750-1d44419d0d9b,TXN,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: Intel (INTC) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-intel-intc-q3-140202893.html,1666274522,STORY,"['INTC', 'TXN']","[The market expects Intel (INTC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80.1%.Revenues are expected to be $15.49 billion, down 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intel?For Intel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intel would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -57.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Intel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, Texas Instruments (TXN), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.1 billion, up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Texas Instruments has been revised 0.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.90%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Texas Instruments will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,80a6cded-2435-3d64-b8c7-2885735b5af6,RRC,2022-10-21,Are Investors Undervaluing Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) By 41%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-range-resources-corporation-154848094.html,1666280928,STORY,['RRC'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.45bUS$1.42bUS$1.27bUS$898.0mUS$813.1mUS$764.1mUS$736.4mUS$722.0mUS$716.5mUS$716.9mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -9.46%Est @ -6.03%Est @ -3.62%Est @ -1.94%Est @ -0.77%Est @ 0.06% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$990US$646US$539US$467US$414US$374US$342US$315(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.6bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$717m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.0%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$4.9bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$28.3, the company appears quite good value at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Range Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.408. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Range Resources, we've compiled three relevant items you should further examine:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Range Resources   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does RRC's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the metals sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Metal Stocks to Invest In.Metals and precious metals have been on the rise as far as prices are concerned since the start of 2022. One of the main reasons for the rise is the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing disruptions in global markets for critical raw materials including a variety of metals such as nickel and stainless steel. As a result, the World Bank's Metals and Minerals Price Index rose by 13% in the first quarter of 2022, according to a Commodity Markets Outlook Report published by the World Bank this April. Similarly, the bank's Precious Metals Index gained 4% over the same period. Both the rises were driven by a higher demand in investment when it came to metals and precious metals. This increase in demand was seen to be directly related to the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.As a result of the above, stocks such as the Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), among others, have been benefitting from increasing popularity in investment circles. The World Bank expects metal prices to rise by a further 16% in 2022, while precious metals are expected to see a slight rise in prices as well.Aluminum, copper, nickel, and tin prices were seen to reach historically high levels in March 2022. Higher energy costs causing production constraints also contributed to these developments. Individually, iron ore, aluminum, nickel, tin, and zinc prices rose by 27%, 18%, 35%, 12%, and 11%, respectively.Photo by Russ Ward on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the 11 best metal stocks to invest in.Our MethodologyWe have selected metals stocks that have recently been performing well in the sector, based on factors such as projected growth rates in their EPS, revenue, and free cash flow, alongside positive news driving up share prices and the latest earnings results.

Here's what the firm said:“ArcelorMittal is a global integrated steel producer trading at around 2x EBITDA which will likely generate over 50% of their market cap in free cash flow in the next 8-10 quarters. This is after a period of substantial deleveraging which now allows the company to use FCF primarily towards share buybacks. We also believe the company’s numerous joint ventures have an underappreciated $10+ billion of value. When accounting for this, we believe MT is even cheaper on a price/tangible book basis (~0.4x).If the company can simply maintain its multiple while returning most, if not all, that FCF to shareholders in the form of buybacks, we believe 50%+ upside is conservative. Given the company’s deleveraged balance sheet, even if steel pricing and profitability decline materially, we believe the downside will be limited as historically MT trades in a range of 5-7x EBITDA versus the current 2x. “ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), like Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR). These, among other best momentum stocks, are discussed further in the article below.Story continuesImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the best momentum stocks to invest in, we screened for stocks that are up at least 30% for the year, as of October 20, and are expected to maintain this uptrend as we move into 2023.

Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical technology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.5%.Revenues are expected to be $66.92 million, up 44.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.49% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for SeaSpine?For SeaSpine, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that SeaSpine will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that SeaSpine would post a loss of $0.35 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.38, delivering a surprise of -8.57%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.SeaSpine appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsThermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $4.78 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -17%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $9.86 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Thermo Fisher has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.13%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).

Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

(NYSE:CTVA) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Corteva Agriscience, one of the world’s largest seed and crop protection companies, was a primary contributor for the quarter. Due to its respected brand and the value-added benefits of its patented seeds and crop protection solutions for farmers, Corteva has been able to more than offset input cost inflation with sustainable price increases. In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Integer would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.04, delivering a surprise of -11.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Integer doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerEdwards Lifesciences (EW), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.62 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +14.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.34 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Edwards Lifesciences has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.81%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Edwards Lifesciences will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.08 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.72%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions would post earnings of $1.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of 1.61%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Marsh &amp; McLennan , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, posted revenues of $4.77 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Marsh &amp; McLennan shares have lost about 9.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for Marsh &amp; McLennan?While Marsh &amp; McLennan has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marsh &amp; McLennan: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.43 on $5.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.78 on $21.07 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a surprise of 4.71% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected strong physical occupancy and sustained growth in pricing power.Over the trailing four quarters, Equity Residential surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average surprise being 1.53%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential Price and EPS SurpriseEquity Residential price-eps-surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for EQR before this announcement.Key FactorsFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.  Amid this, Equity Residential is expected to have benefited from its portfolio diversification in the urban and suburban markets. With healthy demand, EQR is expected to have experienced solid leasing and renewal activity and a favorable pricing position in the third quarter. It has a healthy balance sheet and banks on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth.Per Equity Residential’s August-end released operating update, the company concluded a strong leasing season, driven by healthy demand and pricing for its apartment units. As a result, EQR noted that its same-store revenue growth is on track to either match or surpass the midpoint of its guidance range mentioned in its second-quarter 2022 earnings release.Looking at some of Equity Residential’s same-store residential operating trends, we notice that the physical occupancy remained high through June and July at 96.7% and 96.5%, respectively. The preliminary physical occupancy rate for August was 96.6%.The percentage of residents renewing by month remained more than 50% in June, July and August. The same in June was recorded at 55%, while in July and August, it remained steady at 52%. The blended rate in June came in at 14.3% and started to decline from then onward. In July, the figure fell to 12.8% and declined to 11.8% in August.Considering normal seasonal demand patterns, the rents for the year peaked earlier this August. Management expected rents to start moderating from here onward for the remainder of 2022.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s quarterly revenues stands at $693.6 million, indicating an 11.3% increase year over year. The consensus estimate for total same-store revenues is currently pegged at $655.4 million, indicating growth from $645.8 million in the prior quarter.The consensus estimate for physical occupancy is presently pegged at 96.45% for the third quarter, marginally up from 96.40% in the prior quarter.Moreover, analysts seem to have become optimistic about the company’s third-quarter performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the July-September quarter’s FFO per share has moved a cent up to 91 cents over the past month. It also suggests a year-over-year increase of nearly 18.2%.For the third quarter of 2022, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share in the band of 89-93 cents.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsEquity Residential does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: EQR has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$684m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 32% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about MGM Resorts International. View our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About MGM Resorts International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in MGM Resorts International. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGM Resorts International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in MGM Resorts International. IAC Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 9.8% and 6.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MGM Resorts InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of MGM Resorts International. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$88m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGM Resorts International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 16% of MGM Resorts International. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for MGM Resorts International   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

If you want to read about some more health insurance stocks, go directly to Top 5 Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.The health insurance industry has rapidly evolved over the past few years as insurer participation, pricing, and advanced plans drive innovation within the sector. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, 55 new insurers entered the market in 2022, representing a 21% increase over the past year, and marking the highest growth in participation in the industry since 2015, when participation had grown by around 26%. Over the past four years, product offerings have also increased, nearly tripling with half of that growth happening between 2021 and 2022. Tech-enabled insurance plans have contributed most to these growth numbers, per data gathered by the consulting firm, led by firms like Oscar and Bright Health. Some of the other prominent names in the insurance sector that have growth catalysts include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). Another interesting trend in the sector is the participation of exclusive provider organization plans. These have quadrupled to 36% as a share of all plan type offerings. Total health expenditure is expected to continue on an upward trend across the globe for the next five years. This growth is closely correlated with industry revenues in the health insurance world. However, McKinsey has cautioned that macro uncertainty will persist in part because the enhanced premium subsidies created by the American Rescue Plan Act are due to expire at the end of 2022. If these subsidies are not renewed, pricing and consumer participation may face headwinds in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the health insurance sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesTop 10 Health Insurance Stocks to BuyIakov Filimonov/Shutterstock.comTop Health Insurance Stocks to Buy10. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) provides financial products and services internationally. It is one of the best insurance stocks to invest in. On October 12, Barclays analyst John Aiken maintained an Overweight rating on Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) stock lowered the price to C$29 from C$30, noting that the continued decline in equity valuations driven by lower asset levels within the wealth operations and seed losses will likely dampen earnings growth in the quarter.  At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 15 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $155 million in Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), compared to 19 in the preceding quarter worth $517.5 million. Just like Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), the Canadian life insurer operating primarily in North America and Asia, is a new holding. Manulife offers a full suite of life insurance products as well as retirement and wealth management services. While the wealth management and retirement products appeal to the aging populations of the Western world, long-term life insurance products address the needs of the growing number of middle-class families in places like China and southeast Asia. COVID-19-induced lockdowns in China brought the shares down to a significant discount to our estimate of long-term value. The holding now serves as a nice diversifier to our Asia-centered insurers AIA and Ping An.”9. Clover Health Investments, Corp.

If you want to read about some more insurance stocks, go directly to 5 Cheap Insurance Stocks to Buy Now.The insurance sector has been one of the few sectors of the stock market that has generally been predictable and stable. This has changed over the past few years as tech-enabled disruption reshapes conventional economics. According to a report by professional services firm PwC, some of the other reasons for the changes in the sector include changes to risk profiles because of the climate crisis, distribution needs becoming omni-channel, and customers who expect products tailored just for them. Some of the top insurance stocks to monitor in this context include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). These firms are working on areas such as digitization, data and integration, brand and distribution, innovative products, strategic partnerships, and effective structuring to stay ahead of the competition. As the industry involves, per PwC, a focus on discipline is helping private equity, asset managers, and other new entrants to capitalize on the disruption. Consulting firm EY contends that ecosystems, open insurance, workforce transformation, and sustainability are set to define near-term prospects for the insurance industry. However, labor shortages and changes in the delivery of care and cybersecurity threats are likely to force health insurance towards embracing new approaches to risk management. Some of these new approaches include the digitization of core processes, migrations to the cloud, and the embrace of flexible sourcing models.Research firm Deloitte has identified rising inflation, interest rates, loss costs, the threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval as some of the headwinds for the insurance sector in the coming months. The firm claims that the transformation in the life insurance industry is key to sustainable growth for the sector, as insurance firms double down on their pandemic-spurred digital enhancements, introduce new products, services, and distribution options, and seek out previously underserved customer niches.Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the insurance sector and are trading at a discount compared to peers were selected for the list.

HCC.Industry: CoalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1994628/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-still-attractive-coal-industryThe Zacks Coal industry stocks have staged a rebound courtesy of global demand after the pandemic-led lockdowns and surging natural gas prices.  Improving coal prices and demand boosted the profit levels of coal operators. Demand for coal might continue to improve for the next few years as clean energy sources may not be able to fill the increase in energy demand.With higher global economic activity, electricity demand is rising, and utility operators are buying more coal to boost production. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is creating fresh demand from coal importing countries and pushing up coal prices.As global steel production improves, coal stocks like Peabody Energy Corp., Alliance Resource Partners L.P., CONSOL Energy and Warrior Met Caol Inc. are expected to gain.About the IndustryThe Zacks Coal industry comprises companies involved in the discovery and mining of coal. Coal is mined by either the opencast or the underground method. The commodity is valued for its energy content and used worldwide to generate electricity, and manufacture steel and cement. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the current U.S. estimated recoverable coal reserves are about 252 billion short tons, of which about 58% is underground mineable coal.Given the current production rates, coal resources are likely to last many more years. Five states in the United States contribute nearly 70% of yearly production and 60% of coal production from surface mining. Per EIA, the coal industry may benefit from the rise in natural gas prices in the United States. This would result in additional demand for coal.Story continues3 Trends Likely to Impact the Coal IndustryCoal to Benefit From Steel Industry Demand:  The improvement in coal exports is boosting the prospect of U.S. coal miners.  The rollout of vaccines and easing of pandemic-related restrictions have revived industrial and commercial activities across the globe, spurring electricity demand. EIA expects U.S. coal production volumes to increase 20 millions of short tons (MMst) in 2022 and touch 598 MMst.Per the World Steel Association, global steel demand would contract 2.3% in 2022 to reach 1,796.7 Mt due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Steel production is expected to improve 1% in 2023 to reach 1814.7 Mt and boost the prospects of the coal operators.Global Coal Demand and Prices to Move Upward: Coal was continuously losing ground to natural gas and other renewable energy as a fuel source, but a global economic recovery in 2021 resulted in a rebound in demand. Per the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), the demand for coal can attain new highs in 2022 due to a rebound in the global economy, aided by demand arising from the Asian countries.Even though the rising usage of renewable energy will pose a big challenge for coal, the demand and use of the commodity may not fall in Asian economies. This, in turn, would continue to boost the prospects of U.S. coal miners. The ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has hampered the supply of coal volumes from Russia to other countries, creating coal export opportunities for U.S. coal producers. Taking into consideration all factors, IEA expects global coal demand to increase 0.7% from 2021 to 8 billion tons in 2022 and improve further in 2023.New Emission Policy Will Hurt Coal Industry: The improvement in demand for coal is expected to be short-lived as the new environmental policy will target 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, which will significantly lower demand for coal from the U.S. electricity space. Per EIA, coal-fired electricity generation would drop from 23% U.S. total in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and 19% in 2023. Unless utility operators invest heavily in pollution-control measures to reduce emissions from power plants, domestic coal usage would fall significantly.Going forward, coal industry operators are likely to face many difficulties as a number of electric utilities have decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 and completely cut down coal usage. Per EIA, total coal consumption in the United States will drop 5.1% in 2022 to 518.1 MMst and further by 6% to 487 MMst in 2023.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Coal industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil and Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong performance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Photon, which is controlled by Morgan Stanley, is PNE's largest shareholder.Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners (MSIP) acquired the PNE stake following a failed takeover attempt in 2020. Since then, PNE's shares have risen nearly five-fold, driven by global appetite for renewable energy assets.PNE, which has a project pipeline of more than 9 gigawatt and a generation portfolio worth 261 megawatt, has a current market capitalisation of 1.4 billion euros ($1.38 billion), valuing Morgan Stanley's stake at 560 million euros.The stake may attract interest from parties including French utility Engie and Sweden-based private equity firm EQT, the people said, adding that deliberations were at an early stage and that there was no certainty a deal will happen.Engie and EQT declined to comment.Buying the whole stake would trigger a mandatory takeover bid for all of PNE under German stock market rules.""The Board of Management of PNE AG will support the intended preliminary discussions to the extent permitted by law and in the interest of the Company,"" the statement said.A potential sale of MSIP's participation would result in chunky profits given the investment bank bought in at 4.00 euros per share and saw PNE's value grow to 18.50 euros.News about the potential stake comes in the wake of major renewables deal in recent weeks, including RWE's $6.8 billion purchase of Con Edison's cleantech unit and BP's $4.1 billion takeover of U.S. biogas producer Archaea.($1 = 1.0175 euros)(Reporting by Christoph Steitz, Andres Gonzalez and Emma-Victoria Farr; Additional reporting by Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Susan Fenton and Josie Kao)]"

The shares down about 4%. It's actually not down nearly as much as it was in pre-market trading. But Alcoa reporting worse than estimated results in the quarter here. Adjusted EBITDA down 71% here and coming in below estimates. As we talk about lower demand for certain things, Alcoa certainly seems to be falling into that category here.And we've also talked a lot about, by the way, a rollover in certain commodity prices, right? That's something that we talked about recently with the likes of Cathie Wood, for example. And here's an area where there is perhaps some of that pain being felt.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, another forward-looking company, just like we talked about with Knight. And I'm looking at this stat right now in terms of production for Alcoa. They produced 497,000 metric tons of aluminum in the quarter. That was relatively flat versus what they produced in the second quarter.So, to me, that is really indicative of a global economy slowing down. And you have to wonder, well, does it accelerate into the fourth quarter, or does it slow further? And we're sitting here three months from now, and Alcoa's output or production is now declining. You would have to think it's going to decline.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, you're looking at an operation right now for them that even the leadership has had to acknowledge is somewhat unstable right now. They mentioned within this release, as we move forward, we're focused on some of the items in our direct control, including boosting operational stability, advancing some of their technologies, and then having some of their more sustainable product offerings so that they can benefit from the positive long-term fundamentals for the aluminum industry.But at least, in this most recent quarter, what they did see was lower prices. They saw higher costs for energy and raw materials. And they were still trying to maintain a strong balance sheet throughout all of that, too.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Not easy.BRIAN SOZZI: Not easy.JULIE HYMAN: Not easy to do.BRIAN SOZZI: And they get paid very well. They get paid very well to navigate these challenges, Julie.JULIE HYMAN: If they get paid in stock, then they get paid a little less right now than they did.BRIAN SOZZI: They're also getting bonuses.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, it's true.

51,9ad8f879-beea-304d-9b25-12944ac2de98,FE,2022-10-21,Southern Co. (SO) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-co-earnings-expected-grow-140202099.html,1666274522,STORY,"['SO', 'FE']","[The market expects Southern Co. (SO) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.7 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.61% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co.For Southern Co.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Co. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southern Co. Would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.07, delivering a surprise of +27.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southern Co. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsFirstEnergy (FE), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.19 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for FirstEnergy has been revised 6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.45%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that FirstEnergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:BTI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Distillate Capital’s International FSV Strategy is less expensive, more fundamentally stable, and less levered than the benchmark All Country World Ex U.S. (ACWI-EX US) Index.The largest new position is British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), which was not owned previously due to leverage, but now passes that threshold and offers an 11% free cash flow to market cap yield.”11.

(NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure. Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”10.

Its long-term value is similar to when we last owned it but is down 50+% in price in sympathy with broader energy concerns.PSX is an integrated energy company with 4 central divisions: refining, chemicals, midstream (pipelines etc.) and marketing (gas stations). Due to downstream demand destruction, the refining business is taking it on the chin. This could persist for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As in years past, a lot of focus is given to the refining business as it has historically been the lion’s share of the value for PSX. Management has invested in the non-refining businesses who now make up most of the value of the company.Management is extremely thoughtful with capital allocation and has focused on a healthy balance sheet with opportunistic share repurchases. They do not spend capex on projects unless they meet a healthy margin of safety for returns.PSX should be able to generate substantial amounts of cash in the coming years and generate a 15+% free cash flow yield on quarter-end pricing. If the stock remains low, management will be buying a lot of stock.”8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of October 19: 3.82%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas, is one of the elite income stocks to consider.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares valued at $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Dividend Yield as of October 19: 4.23%FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) generates, transmits, and distributes electricity in the United States.

(NYSE:FE), up from 33 funds in the earlier quarter. Carl Icahn’s Icahn Capital LP is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 19 million shares worth $728 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Income Strategy has to say about FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On a regional level, the Strategy’s largest exposure is in the U.S. and Canada (44%), consisting of regulated and contracted utilities (31%) and economically sensitive user-pays infrastructure (13%).During the quarter we initiated new positions in U.S. electric utility FirstEnergy.  With supply chain issues, higher housing costs, higher commodity prices and producer price inflation remaining square in the sights for 2022, we think higher inflation is a risk for global markets. We expect growth to slow to trend or below by mid-2022 and U.S.”6.

(NYSE:C), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the top dividend stocks to invest in. Here is what First Eagle Investments Global Fund has to say about Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance.

Corporation VFC is likely to register top and bottom-line decreases from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s respective figures when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Oct 26, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $3,102 million, indicating a 3% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at 74 cents per share, suggesting a 33.3% decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. Earnings estimates have moved 25.3% south in the past 30 days.We note that V.F. Corp delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.1% in the trailing four quarters, on average.Key Factors to NoteOn Sep 28, V.F. Corp issued guidance for the fiscal quarter under review. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, management projected revenue growth in a low-single digit in constant dollars and adjusted earnings of 70-75 cents, indicating a fall from $1.11 delivered in the year-earlier fiscal quarter. Management stated that the ongoing uncertainty, weaker-than-anticipated back-to-school performance at Vans and higher inventory causing increased promotions in North America were concerns.Moreover, VFC witnesses persistent sluggishness in the APAC region, particularly in China, due to drab traffic stemming from COVID-related lockdowns, local regulations, travel restrictions and consumer anxiety. Also, elevated SG&amp;A costs and rising freight expenses related to supply-chain disruptions remain headwinds. Continued congestion and disruption from labor shortages and equipment constraints across the logistics network are expected to have hurt the bottom line.On the positive front, V.F. Corp has been seeing strength across its brands for a while. In addition, both EMEA and North America regions are performing well. VFC is benefiting from Supreme’s strong follower base among the younger generation. These tailwinds might have aided the quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for V.F. Corp this time around.

This company, which is in the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This upscale clothing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 36.32%.For the most recent quarter, Ralph Lauren was expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, but it reported $1.88 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.30%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.30 per share, while it actually produced $0.49 per share, a surprise of 63.33%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ralph Lauren lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ralph Lauren has an Earnings ESP of +0.08% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 10, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

63,668218e4-3810-3c29-bb9d-e6e252aa40c2,RL,2022-10-21,Investors in Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) have unfortunately lost 20% over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-ralph-lauren-nyse-rl-151147974.html,1666278707,STORY,['RL'],"[It's understandable if you feel frustrated when a stock you own sees a lower share price. But sometimes broader market conditions have more of an impact on prices than the actual business performance. The Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is down 23% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -20% once you include the dividend. That's better than the market which declined 24% over the last year. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 5.5% in that time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the Ralph Lauren share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Ralph Lauren managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthRalph Lauren is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Ralph Lauren, it has a TSR of -20% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Ralph Lauren shares lost 20% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 2%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Ralph Lauren .Of course Ralph Lauren may not be the best stock to buy.

In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Third Point discussed stocks like PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is an electricity and natural gas distribution company. On October 18, 2022, PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock closed at $14.15 per share. One-month return of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)  was 8.76% and its shares gained 22.94% of their value over the last 52 weeks. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)  has a market capitalization of $34.886 billion.Here is what Third Point specifically said about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)  in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Since we wrote about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in May, the Company has continued to close the valuation gap with its regulated peer group. Over the third quarter PCG’s stock rose 25% versus a 6% decline in the XLU (a proxy for the S&amp;P 500 Utilities Sector). Outperformance was driven by the S&amp;P 500 indexing announcement and continued execution by Patti Poppe, the recently hired CEO, and her team. Management has focused its efforts on mitigating physical and financial risk by building in layers of protection against catastrophic wildfires, financial uncertainty, and rate-payer volatility. Importantly for a utility company, Ms. Poppe has a plan to make much needed investments in safety, reliability, and service quality via capital investment while simultaneously reducing operating expenses.Despite the recent move, we are optimistic about the Company's prospects with industry leading 10% EPS growth and likely dividend reinstatement in 2023. PG&amp;E, which currently trades at a 6x discount to peers on ’23 earnings, should continue to re-rate as investors become more familiar with the enhanced regulatory framework under AB1054 and build further confidence in management’s execution capabilities.”Story continues15 Biggest Government Owned Utility Companies in the USHigh-voltage power lines.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.92 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PG&amp;E?For PG&amp;E, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -16.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PG&amp;E would post earnings of $0.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.25, delivering a surprise of -16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR). These, among other best momentum stocks, are discussed further in the article below.Story continuesImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the best momentum stocks to invest in, we screened for stocks that are up at least 30% for the year, as of October 20, and are expected to maintain this uptrend as we move into 2023. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that had positive market sentiment, upside potential, and were trading at attractive valuations. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and their year-to-date performance. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their year-to-date returns.Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In12. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS)YTD Return as of October 20: 29.46%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) is a leading global provider of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. At the end of Q2 2022, 50 hedge funds held stakes in The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS). The total value of these stakes amounted to $895.76 million.

Juvekar revised his price target on The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) to $58 from $61 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares. The stock has an average price target of roughly $67, which implies a 31% upside from current levels.Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) brought up the rear as fertilizer prices pulled back following a massive price spike due to the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia and Belarus, both major suppliers of potash fertilizers. Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases.

(NYSE:CTVA) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Corteva Agriscience, one of the world’s largest seed and crop protection companies, was a primary contributor for the quarter. Due to its respected brand and the value-added benefits of its patented seeds and crop protection solutions for farmers, Corteva has been able to more than offset input cost inflation with sustainable price increases. In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

According to a report by iShares, dividend growers reported a 12.5% decline in bear markets from 1978 to 2021, compared with a 30.7% drop in non-dividend payers. The report also cited Bloomberg’s data from December 1999 to December 2021 and mentioned that dividend equities have become a chief source of income in a typical 60/40 portfolio.Companies that have histories of raising their dividends consistently have demonstrated better income-generating abilities compared with their peers.

69,be872fb9-0f68-3b88-a811-64c3e1709ae2,MRO,2022-10-21,7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy and Hold Until 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-long-term-stocks-buy-175226685.html,1666088426,STORY,"['ATKR', 'LPX', 'ZIM', 'MRO', 'DDS']","[While stocks are still in bear market mode, and may have yet to reach a bottom, now is a great time to consider long-term stocks to buy and hold. As uncertainty continues to run high, plenty of high-quality stocks continue to be “on sale.”Snapping them up today could prove to be a  profitable move in two ways. Once the bull market returns, these stocks are positioned to make a strong move higher. Although it’s nearly impossible to call when exactly the market will officially “bottom out” and the tides will turn, it may arrive sooner than you think.As you may know, the stock market is forward-looking; it prices in good news and bad news at the onset. That means stocks will likely begin to make a comeback when economic conditions begin to improve. More and more institutional investors are anticipating stocks to rebound starting next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAhead of a possible 2023 stock market recovery, add these long-term to buy and hold to your portfolio. All but one earns an A in Portfolio Grader.ATKRAtkore’s$88.66DDSDillard’s$314.32DVNDevon Energy$69.80ENPHEnphase Energy$242.29MROMarathon Oil$27.14ONON Semiconductor$8.75OXYOccidental Petroleum$67.36Atkore (ATKR)An array of electrical conduits are lined up in a row across the ceiling of a room.Source: Sinn P. Photography / Shutterstock.comElectrical infrastructure supplier Atkore’s (NYSE:ATKR) shares have made a strong move higher in recent weeks. Since the end of September, the stock has zoomed from around $70 to prices approaching $90 per share.Even so, ATKR stock is still down nearly 20% year-to-date. Pessimism about a likely economic slowdown has led to investors giving this company a discounted valuation (4 times 2022 earnings). Current sentiment is that Atkore’s earnings, which were up 53% last quarter will take a big dive in a downturn.But even when accounting for a 2023 earnings decline, ATKR is cheap. Based on 2023 forecasts, which call for earnings per share (or EPS) to drop around 36%, shares still have a super-low forward price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio of 6.2. Once uncertainty clears up, this stock, which earns a B in Portfolio Grader, may be in for a massive re-rating.Story continuesDillard’s (DDS)A photo of the exterior of a Dillard's DDS store with the company logo above the entrance.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comIn contrast to other retailer stocks, Dillard’s (NYSE:DDS) remains in the green for 2022, up around 26%. This is even more impressive if you remember the epic run this department store operator went on during the 2021 pandemic recovery.With around 18.7% of its outstanding float sold short, the “smart money” continues to bet against DDS stock. However, two factors may enable this DDS (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) to surge rather than sink from here.First, trading for only 7.75 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year (ending January 2023), the market has already priced in the prospect of an earnings drop next fiscal year.Given its strong beat in its last quarterly earnings report (EPS of $9.30, versus $2.88 consensus estimates), current earnings forecasts may be too conservative. Second, Dillards’ share repurchase program could also continue to give the stock a lift.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIn September, it may have seemed as if oil prices were set to move lower, yet surging again on news of an OPEC+ production cut, it’s now very likely high energy prices are here to stay. That’s good news for investors in energy stocks, such as Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), which earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Up around 73% over the past twelve months, if you already own DVN stock, you may be itching to take the money and run. However, given that high energy prices will enable this oil and gas exploration and production company to continue reporting strong earnings, the better move here may be to let it ride.High earnings will enable Devon to pursue many avenues to further increase shareholder value. These include not only return-of-capital efforts such as share repurchases and dividends but bolt-on acquisitions (like its recent purchase of Validus Energy) as well.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) may be the polar opposite of Devon Energy. However, like Devon, this is another stock that earns an A in Portfolio Grader, that is up big in the past year, and has further room to run over the next twelve months.At first, you may be doubtful about additional runway for ENPH stock. In fact, you may think shares in this provider of solar energy inverters and battery storage products are ripe for a correction.Not so fast. Secular trends are still very favorable for Enphase. Europe’s energy crisis is accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources like solar. The usage of zero-carbon energy is rising fast in the U.S. as well. The company may remain in high-growth mode during a downturn, which could enable ENPH to keep charging higher.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another winning stock that could keep on winning, making it one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold until at least next year.The massive spike in energy prices has been the main driver of this oil exploration stock’s big move higher (67.6%) over the past year.However, the company’s share repurchase program has also played a role in the extended MRO stock rally. Management remains committed to buying back shares. That’s good news for investors, as buying back shares brings down Marathon’s share count, which helps to increase earnings on a per-share basis.Along with buybacks giving shares a steady lift, MRO stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader), which trades for only 5.6 times earnings, could get re-rated. If oil prices remain high, or climb again, there will be greater confidence that Marathon’s earnings will remain high.ON Semiconductor (ON)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockFor long an under-the-radar chip stock, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) has received greater attention in recent months. This, however, hasn’t prevented shares from delivering a mixed performance.ON stock moved higher during the summer, thanks to both its addition to the S&amp;P 500, as well as due to the passage of the CHIPS Act by the U.S. Congress. Unfortunately, concerns about a pending recession have outweighed the positives, pushing shares lower.Yet this pullback may be an overreaction. A near-term severe dry-up in demand may not happen as automotive chip demand continues to outstrip supply. The subsidies provided by the CHIPS Act will help give the chip industry a boost, this company included. These factors point to ON stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) getting out of its present slump.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comWith Warren Buffett still increasing his firm’s position in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), this energy company continues to stay in the headlines. Yet the bull case for this stock isn’t just based on the fact that “Buffett’s buying it.”Like DVN and MRO, OXY stock is another oil and gas play trading at a heavily-discounted valuation, due to doubts that oil prices will remain at relatively higher prices. However, these doubts continue to clear up. There’s still no end in sight for the Russia/Ukraine conflict.Add in OPEC’s latest moves, limited supply will likely outweigh a possible drop in global demand caused by a recession. Favorable oil and gas trends, along with the positive impact of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) continuing to increase its position, could keep OXY stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) on an upwards trajectory.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ATKR, DDS, DVN, ENPH, MRO, ON and OXY.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Barrett Business Services and Paychex are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.BBSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.19, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 26.49. We also note that BBSI has a PEG ratio of 0.94. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.53.Another notable valuation metric for BBSI is its P/B ratio of 3.37. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.80.Based on these metrics and many more, BBSI holds a Value grade of A, while PAYX has a Value grade of C.Both BBSI and PAYX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that BBSI is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more large cap stocks, go directly to 5 Best Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now.Economic experts are forecasting a broad recession in the United States in the next few months due to runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative tightening, and the impact of the Russian war in Ukraine. Recently, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest and well-reputed banks in the US, told news platform CNBC that a very, very serious mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the US and global economy into recession by the middle of next year.Dimon was of the opinion that even though a recession was more than likely, the US economy appeared to be in much better shape than before the last big financial meltdown in 2008. The executive also criticized the central bank for waiting too long and doing too little as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, but acknowledged that it was now clearly catching up. The comments of Dimon echo those of other top experts. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, has said that the economy is on a bumpy journey to a better destination. El-Erian made the comments during an appearance on CBS, in which he stressed that the main source of volatility in the markets was the changing perceptions of the Federal Reserve. He added that the central bank had mischaracterized inflation as transitory earlier this year and did not act in a meaningful way after inflation remained persistent and high. This has battered the markets but also means that large-cap stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are trading at discounts.Our MethodologyThe companies that have market capitalizations greater than $10 billion were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues11 Best Large Cap Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now11.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is one of the best large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Distillate Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The largest exited positions were Oracle, which outperformed significantly, and Texas Instruments and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), which were roughly flat versus the market in the quarter but were edged out for inclusion by other stocks that became even more attractively valued.”10. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55    Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. It is one of the top large cap stocks to invest in. On September 13, Starbucks announced new benefits for non-union locations.

Here is what the fund said:“Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis coffee chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27%.Revenues are expected to be $8.44 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Starbucks?For Starbucks, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Starbucks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Starbucks would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.84, delivering a surprise of +9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR). These, among other best momentum stocks, are discussed further in the article below.Story continuesImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the best momentum stocks to invest in, we screened for stocks that are up at least 30% for the year, as of October 20, and are expected to maintain this uptrend as we move into 2023. We narrowed down our selection to stocks that had positive market sentiment, upside potential, and were trading at attractive valuations. Along with each stock, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment, analyst ratings, and their year-to-date performance. We have ranked these stocks in ascending order of their year-to-date returns.Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In12.

Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

(NYSE:CTVA) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Corteva Agriscience, one of the world’s largest seed and crop protection companies, was a primary contributor for the quarter. Due to its respected brand and the value-added benefits of its patented seeds and crop protection solutions for farmers, Corteva has been able to more than offset input cost inflation with sustainable price increases. In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

92,276bec5c-f068-3654-b5aa-7bf7e05e035d,HST,2022-10-21,Is Now A Good Time To Buy Host Hotels?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-good-time-buy-host-103855035.html,1666262335,STORY,"['HST', 'MAR']","[Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is off about 28% from its high of $21.63 set last May. The dividend of 48 cents is 3%. So is now a good time to buy this real estate investment trust (REIT)? Take a closer look:On its website, Bethesda, Maryland-based Host Hotels &amp; Resorts calls itself “the world’s largest lodging REIT.” It owns and operates 78 hotels with over 42,000 rooms in 20 of the top markets across the U.S. Its portfolio includes well-known names such as Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton and Hyatt. It owns many upscale properties in central business districts conveniently located near airports.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is an S&amp;P 500 company with a total enterprise value of $18.2 billion.The 52-week range for the stock is $15.10 to $21.63, and it’s about break even on the year, beating the negative overall S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin. But looking at its five-year track record, including dividends, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts has lost about 10% over that time. To its credit, the stock is up about 13% off its lows in July.The good news is that revenue has risen over the past four quarters. Second-quarter revenue of $1.38 billion was up 105% year-over-year. Earnings per share (EPS) was also up 526% year-over-year. The bad news is that EPS has been inconsistent from quarter to quarter over the past year, with two negative quarters out of the last five. The next earnings call is scheduled for Nov. 2.The dividend bounced between 25 cents and 20 cents several times from 2017 to 2020. But in June 2020, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts was forced to slash its dividend to only 6 cents when COVID-19 dealt a serious blow to the travel industry. The dividend has only partially recovered since then.Second-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of 58 cents and a payout ratio of 11% leave plenty of room for dividend growth if Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is willing to take that step. But the question is: Will the REIT hike the dividend or use much of the FFO to pay down its ongoing debt of $4.2 billion?Story continuesGiven its most recent track record, one might expect Host Hotels &amp; Resorts to come through with decent revenue and EPS in its next quarterly report. But income investors don’t want a roller coaster ride of dividends — they want stable and secure dividends that grow slowly over time. And this stock has basically gone nowhere over the past five years while providing only half of what other hotel REITs pay in dividends.So is now a good time to buy Host Hotels &amp; Resorts? Probably not. There are better REITs to be found, and with inflation and recessionary fears still in the market, it could be quite some time before Host Hotel &amp; Resorts finds its footing.The recent bounce off the lows is promising, and hopefully, the company will announce a dividend increase if the upcoming earnings report is positive, but it might be prudent for investors to at least wait to see the report before purchasing Host Hotels &amp; Resorts.Read next: Rapidly Growing REIT Sustains 8% Dividend In Bear MarketLatest Real Estate Investing Insights:The CalTier Multi-Family Portfolio Fund recently completed a new investment in lakefront multifamily and mixed-use development.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.Heading into today, shares of the airline had lost 2.93% over the past month, outpacing the Transportation sector's loss of 5.56% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.13% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Southwest Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Southwest Airlines to post earnings of $0.41 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 278.26%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.23 billion, up 33.13% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.10 per share and revenue of $24.09 billion. These totals would mark changes of +197.67% and +52.54%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Southwest Airlines. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +278.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.23 billion, up 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest?For Southwest, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southwest will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southwest would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southwest doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.10 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +190.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $907.57 million, up 44.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Frontier Group has been revised 29% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -10.35%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Frontier Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Airlines: mixed.

98,a623d137-9ec4-3b8e-a67f-a11dd4677b8e,PM,2022-10-21,Altria (MO)-Philip Morris Strike a Deal for IQOS Transition,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altria-mo-philip-morris-strike-172705242.html,1666286825,STORY,"['PM', 'MO', 'LANC', 'SJM']","[Altria Group, Inc. MO unveiled that its subsidiary signed an agreement with Philip Morris International Inc.‘s PM subsidiary. Per the agreement, Altria will receive cash payments from Phillip Morris to assign exclusive U.S. commercialization rights to the IQOS Tobacco Heating System, effective Apr 30, 2024. Notably, Philip Morris will pay a total amount of nearly $2.7 billion (pre-tax).We note that Philip Morris is one of the industry pioneers in driving the shift from cigarettes to reduced risk products (RRPs). PM is committed to expanding its products to more markets. It has also been making radical progress in the respiratory drug delivery platform as part of the “Beyond Nicotine"" strategy. Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing of tobacco products.Meanwhile, Altria is committed to its efforts of transitioning adult smokers to a smoke-free future. The company believes in a portfolio approach to tobacco harm reduction as it competes in the major smoke-free categories. The company noted that it has reinvested into the internal product development system and expects to finalize designs for two smoke-free products, including a heated tobacco product, by 2022-end. All said, the above-mentioned IQOS transition will allow Altria greater flexibility in allocating resources toward Moving Beyond Smoking.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Working Well for Altria?Altria has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has helped the company stay firm, even amid soft cigarette shipment volumes and times of higher taxes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. In the second quarter of 2022, higher pricing supported revenues across the Smokeable Products and Oral Tobacco categories, which were otherwise hurt by lower volumes.Altria’s tobacco business has not witnessed any material disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s manufacturing facilities and operating centers have stayed functional. Most of the retail stores where the company’s products are sold (like convenience stores) have been considered essential businesses and have remained open. For 2022, the company envisions an adjusted earnings view in the range of $4.79-$4.93 per share. The bottom line indicates growth of 4% to 7% from the $4.61 recorded in 2021.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 4.5% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Story continues2 Solid Staple BetsSome better-ranked stocks are Lancaster Colony LANC and The J.

On a proforma basis, the adjusted EPS of $1.33 grew 8.3% on a currency-neutral basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.38.

The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,225 million.

The proforma total shipment volume rose 2.3%.The proforma adjusted operating income margin fell 1 point on an organic basis.

Total shipment volumes in the region dipped 1.1% to 35,354 million units.Revenues in South &amp; Southeast Asia advanced 13.9% on an organic basis to $1,138 million.

The proforma adjusted operating margin growth on an organic basis is likely to come in the range of a decline of 50 basis points to flat (compared with flat to an increase of 50 basis points expected earlier).The gross margin is expected to be lower due to a considerable rise in IQOS device volumes (with supply restrictions easing), the increased initial cost of IQOS ILUMA, elevated logistic costs, growth-oriented investments in the smoke-free space, raw material and energy cost inflation and incremental supply-chain costs. These are likely to be partially compensated by a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products.Management expects net revenues of about $275 million for the Wellness and Healthcare segment for the full year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have dropped 7.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked stocks from the sector are Lancaster Colony LANC, Lamb Weston LW and TreeHouse Foods THS.Lancaster Colony, which manufactures and markets food products for the retail and foodservice markets, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”10.

Its long-term value is similar to when we last owned it but is down 50+% in price in sympathy with broader energy concerns.PSX is an integrated energy company with 4 central divisions: refining, chemicals, midstream (pipelines etc.) and marketing (gas stations). Due to downstream demand destruction, the refining business is taking it on the chin. This could persist for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As in years past, a lot of focus is given to the refining business as it has historically been the lion’s share of the value for PSX. Management has invested in the non-refining businesses who now make up most of the value of the company.Management is extremely thoughtful with capital allocation and has focused on a healthy balance sheet with opportunistic share repurchases. They do not spend capex on projects unless they meet a healthy margin of safety for returns.PSX should be able to generate substantial amounts of cash in the coming years and generate a 15+% free cash flow yield on quarter-end pricing. If the stock remains low, management will be buying a lot of stock.”8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of October 19: 3.82%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas, is one of the elite income stocks to consider.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares valued at $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Dividend Yield as of October 19: 4.23%FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) generates, transmits, and distributes electricity in the United States.

(NYSE:FE), up from 33 funds in the earlier quarter. Carl Icahn’s Icahn Capital LP is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 19 million shares worth $728 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Income Strategy has to say about FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On a regional level, the Strategy’s largest exposure is in the U.S. and Canada (44%), consisting of regulated and contracted utilities (31%) and economically sensitive user-pays infrastructure (13%).During the quarter we initiated new positions in U.S. electric utility FirstEnergy.  With supply chain issues, higher housing costs, higher commodity prices and producer price inflation remaining square in the sights for 2022, we think higher inflation is a risk for global markets. We expect growth to slow to trend or below by mid-2022 and U.S.”6. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Dividend Yield as of October 19: 5.43%Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a Colorado-based company that explores for gold, copper, silver, zinc, and lead.

(NYSE:C), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the top dividend stocks to invest in. Here is what First Eagle Investments Global Fund has to say about Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Income Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:10 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds10 Oil Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Income Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”6. Verizon Communications Inc.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

Solid commercial deliveries, driven by improving domestic and international travel trends, must have boosted Boeing’s third-quarter earnings performance amid lower defense deliveries.Will Mixed Product Deliveries Aid Results?Boeing’s third-quarter deliveries reflected a solid 31.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure. However, defense shipments declined 2.7% year over year.For manufacturing companies like Boeing, successful deliveries of finished products play a crucial role in boosting revenue growth. Therefore, such a significant improvement witnessed in the jet maker’s deliveries for its commercial segment is expected to benefit Boeing’s overall third-quarter results.The Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteThe jet giant’s military business revenues comprised almost 43% of total revenues as of 2021-end, while that of the commercial business comprised 31%. The decline in defense shipment might have outweighed the revenue benefits of the solid commercial shipment, thereby hurting the overall Q3 top-line performance.Expectations for BGSAs far as Boeing Global Services (BGS) unit’s performance in the third quarter is concerned, we remain optimistic. Notably, a consistent recovery in domestic air travel and recent growth observed in international travel are expected to have bolstered fleet utilization, thereby once again boosting aftermarket commercial jet services in the third quarter of 2022. This, as well as strong cargo markets with several Boeing converted freighter and materials management agreements, must have added an impetus to BGS unit’s Q3 revenues.However, discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement since the second quarter, which might impact BA’s government service revenue profile, thereby partly impacting the overall performance of the BGS unit in Q3.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BGS unit revenues, pegged at $4,556 million, indicates an improvement of 7.9% from third-quarter 2021 reported revenues.The consensus mark for this segment’s earnings is pegged at $670 million, which indicates a solid improvement of 4% from third-quarter 2021 reported earnings.Cash Flow ProjectionsImproved air travel statistics in recent times, which resulted in higher 737 deliveries, along with higher order receipts as well as increased aftermarket services are likely to have contributed to Boeing’s cash flow reserve in the third quarter of 2022.Q3 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we remain optimistic about BA’s overall Q3 revenue and earnings performance. However, the abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program along with supply chain constraints might have had some adverse impact on the company’s bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s total revenues is pegged at $18.27 billion, suggesting a 19.6% improvement from the prior-year reported number. The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 9 cents per share, indicating an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 60 cents.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case for BA.Boeing has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

TDG has an Earnings ESP of +5.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.TDG delivered a four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 5.95%.

HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We believe net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA are important measures that supplement discussions and analysis of our results of operations. We believe it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis used by management. Management relies upon net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measures to review and assess operating performance of its health care facilities and their management teams.Management and investors review both the overall performance (including net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and GAAP net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc.) and operating performance (Adjusted EBITDA) of our health care facilities. Adjusted EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues) are utilized by management and investors to compare our current operating results with the corresponding periods during the previous year and to compare our operating results with other companies in the health care industry. It is reasonable to expect that losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt will occur in future periods, but the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our health care facilities and complicate period comparisons of our results of operations and operations comparisons with other health care companies.Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses (gains) on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. as a measure of operating performance or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.

HCA, Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. ACHC, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS and Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC.Industry: HospitalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1994814/4-stocks-navigating-through-hospital-industry-headwindsThe hospital space is currently fighting labor shortage, inflation and resultant escalated operating expenses. Even though revenues are increasing, growing salaries and benefits are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ margins. Surplus supply and stiff competition are other major headwinds. However, the resumption of non-essential procedures stimulated a recovery in patient volumes.Rising outpatient surgeries and patient days are boosting hospital players’ operations. Also, technological improvements and adoptions are lowering hospitals' treatment costs. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc., Universal Health Services Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. are set to benefit from these developments.About the IndustryThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care, and diagnostic and emergency services, among others.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Trends Deciding the Industry's FateRising Costs: Hospital companies are facing high salaries, wages and benefits, and increasing operating expenses due to inflation, which are eroding margins. Investments in growth projects will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Also, the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Recovering Volumes: Demand for elective procedures will likely drive patient volumes as the intensity of COVID-related headwinds keeps decreasing. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. Nonetheless, financial constraints are forcing patients to delay addressing non-emergency medical needs, as found in a survey by Discover Financial, which can be a major headwind. Discover Financial stated that 31% of Americans with medical debt are holding back doctor-recommended treatments.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are enabling the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals aged above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that are utilized by hospitals. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #202, which places it in the bottom 20% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have decreased 16.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year.

Quote Segment HighlightsPerformance Coatings: Net sales in the segment were $2,705 million in the reported quarter, down 2% year over year, as lower sales volumes, divestitures, the wind down of business in Russia and unfavorable currency impacts more than offset higher selling prices in all businesses. Sales volumes in the segment were down 6%. Selling prices rose 11% year over year.Segment income declined 11% year over year to $362 million. The downside was caused by raw material, logistics and labor cost inflation, unfavorable currency, higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volumes, partly offset by increased selling prices and restructuring cost savings.Industrial Coatings: Sales in the segment were $1,763 million, up 9% year over year. Sales rose due to higher selling prices across all businesses and increased sales volumes, partly offset by the wind down of business in Russia and unfavorable currency impacts. Sales volumes rose 2% year over year and selling prices were up 14% year over year.Segment income totaled $192 million, up 37% year over year. The upside was driven by increased selling prices and higher volumes, partly masked by higher raw material and energy costs and unfavorable currency translation.Story continuesFinancialsPPG Industries ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,029 million, down roughly 15% year over year. Long-term debt rose around 6% year over year to $6,478million.OutlookMoving ahead, the company sees normal seasonal demand trends in the fourth quarter.

124,27f61959-d197-32bc-ab7d-e5cce0216218,MAT,2022-10-21,Jakks Pacific (JAKK) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jakks-pacific-jakk-expected-beat-140202196.html,1666274522.0,STORY,"['JAKK', 'MAT']","[The market expects Jakks Pacific (JAKK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toymaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.9%.Revenues are expected to be $279.36 million, up 17.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Jakks?For Jakks, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Jakks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Jakks would post a loss of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.10, delivering a surprise of +423.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Jakks appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsMattel (MAT), another stock in the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.73 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -13.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Mattel has been revised 4.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.86%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sequentially, we delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion, as the pace of growth in our international business stepped up significantly, complementing already robust levels of activity in North America.Story continues""On a companywide basis, sequential revenue grew 10%, by more than $700 million; EPS—excluding charges and credits—increased 26%; pretax segment operating margin expanded 161 basis points (bps) to reach 18.7%; and free cash flow was $1.1 billion. Both EPS—excluding charges and credits—and pretax segment operating margin represent their highest levels since 2015, as we continue to execute on our returns-focused strategy with much success.""Year-over-year comparisons were exceptional with revenue growing by 28%; EPS—excluding charges and credits—increasing 75%; and pretax segment operating margin expanding 320 bps.""Revenue growth was led by Well Construction and Production Systems as global activity strengthened—particularly in the offshore and international markets. Schlumberger’s leading position in these markets continues to propel strong and profitable growth in the Core. The quarter was also supported by continued backlog conversion, strong technology adoption, and the growing effects of pricing improvements. Reservoir Performance also grew, while Digital &amp; Integration declined as growth in digital solutions was more than offset by the non-repeat of exploration data transfer fees recorded in the previous quarter.International Torque Ramps Up as Revenue Exceeds Third-Quarter 2019 LevelLe Peuch said, ""Third-quarter revenue was driven by International, which posted 13% growth sequentially and 26% year on year. International revenue also exceeded third-quarter 2019 levels, on a rig count that is still approximately 25% lower than in 2019. This comparison highlights the significant gains we have made in strengthening our market participation and our continued growth potential as rigs mobilize internationally in the quarters to come.""Sequentially, growth was prevalent across all international areas led by Europe/CIS/Africa and Latin America, which increased 21% and 14%, respectively. This was driven by increased activity and higher pricing in Well Construction, in addition to higher Production Systems sales. Middle East &amp; Asia revenue improved 8% sequentially due to increased multidivisional activity across Asia and higher Reservoir Performance revenue in the Middle East.Outperforming in our Core—Strong Growth in Well Construction and Production SystemsLe Peuch said, ""Our Schlumberger Core continues to perform extremely well as we continue to leverage our global breadth, leading technology portfolio, and pricing improvements to drive top- and bottom-line growth momentum.""Revenue growth by Division was led by Well Construction with revenue increasing 15% sequentially, outperforming global rig count growth due to strong activity and pricing improvements in the Europe/CIS/Africa and Latin America areas. Similarly, Production Systems revenue grew 14% sequentially on higher product deliveries and backlog conversion, mostly in international offshore basins. Reservoir Performance revenue grew 9% due to higher intervention and stimulation activity, both on land and offshore, particularly in the Middle East &amp; Asia and Europe/CIS/Africa areas. Year on year, revenue from all Divisions experienced double-digit growth, led by Well Construction, which grew 36%.In relation to margin performance, Well Construction and Reservoir Performance led in sequential margin expansion having posted 403 bps and 209 bps growth, respectively. Year on year, Well Construction margin expanded 635 bps to reach 22%, due to broad pricing improvements and improved operating leverage.Constructive Energy Fundamentals and a Supply-Led Decoupling of Upstream InvestmentLe Peuch said, ""While concerns remain over the broader economic climate, the energy industry fundamentals continue to be very constructive. Against the backdrop of the energy crisis and limited spare global capacity, the world faces an urgent need for increased investment to rebalance markets, create supply redundancies, and rebuild spare capacity. All of these are exacerbated by geopolitics and increasing instances of supply disruptions.""These dynamics and the urgency to restore balance are resulting in a supply-led upcycle, characterized by the decoupling of upstream investment from near-term demand volatility. Furthermore, the need for sustained investments is reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory through the end of the decade and by OPEC+ decisions that are keeping commodity prices at supportive levels.""Concurrently, we are witnessing a significant commitment from the industry to decarbonize oil and gas, with E&amp;P operators all over the world deploying capital and adopting technologies—including digital—at scale, to reduce emissions. Taken together, we expect these constructive fundamentals and secular trends to support multiple years of growth.""A Strong Finish in the Making for an Outstanding YearLe Peuch said, ""On a companywide basis, year-to-date revenue increased more than 20%; EPS on a GAAP basis grew 83%; EPS—excluding charges and credits—grew 67%; and pretax segment operating margin expanded 285 bps. I am very proud of these exceptional results delivered by the Schlumberger team as we approach the end of an outstanding year.""As we close the year, we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in the fourth quarter.""To conclude, we have stronger conviction in our strategy and the opportunities across our three engines of growth—the Core, Digital, and New Energy. Constructive market fundamentals for oil and gas, energy security, and the urgency to accelerate the energy transition will support increased investment—in both clean energy technology development and lower carbon oil and gas production. We have positioned the company for long-term outperformance, with a diverse set of opportunities across the entire energy value chain. These technology-led opportunities cover oil and gas, industrial decarbonization, and new energy systems—all supported by digital transformation.""Recent regulatory decisions and incentives reinforce our view of this compelling investment outlook and our strategic direction. We are prepared to apply our technology, global scale, and industrialization capabilities to lead in this energy landscape and deliver outstanding value for our customers and shareholders.""I am truly excited about our future as we continue to drive innovation for a resilient and balanced energy system. I look forward to sharing at our upcoming Investor Conference, our views of the industry, revenue growth ambitions, earnings, and returns potential.""Other EventsOn August 30, 2022, Schlumberger, Aker Solutions, and Subsea 7 announced an agreement to form a joint venture to drive innovation and efficiency in subsea production to help customers unlock reserves and reduce cycle time. The agreement will bring together a portfolio of innovative technologies such as subsea gas compression, all-electric subsea production systems, and other electrification capabilities that help customers meet their decarbonization goals. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second half of 2023.In October 2022, Schlumberger redeemed $895 million of its outstanding notes, consisting of $600 million of 2.65% Senior Notes and $295 million of 3.625% Senior Notes, both due 2022.On October 20, 2022, Schlumberger’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share of outstanding common stock, payable on January 12, 2023, to stockholders of record on December 7, 2022.Revenue by Geographical Area(Stated in millions)Three Months EndedChangeSept. 30,2022Jun. 30,2022Sept. 30,2021SequentialYear-on-yearNorth America$1,543$1,537$1,1290%37%Latin America1,5081,3291,16014%30%Europe/CIS/Africa2,0391,6911,48121%38%Middle East &amp; Asia2,3342,1682,0348%15%Eliminations &amp; other534843n/mn/m$7,477$6,773$5,84710%28%International$5,881$5,188$4,67513%26%North America$1,543$1,537$1,1290%37%n/m = not meaningfulInternationalRevenue in Latin America of $1.5 billion increased 14% sequentially due to higher Well Construction revenue from increased drilling activity and improved pricing. Increased Production Systems sales in Brazil contributed to the sequential revenue growth. Year on year, revenue grew 30% due to higher drilling activity and increased pricing across the area. Increased stimulation and drilling activity in Argentina as well as higher Production Systems sales in Brazil also contributed to the year-on-year revenue growth.Europe/CIS/Africa revenue of $2.0 billion increased 21% sequentially. This significant growth was driven by strong Well Construction activity and improved pricing across the area, higher Production Systems sales in Europe and Scandinavia, and multidivisional activity increases in Sub-Sahara Africa. Year on year, revenue grew 38%, from higher Production Systems sales in Europe and Scandinavia, increased Well Construction activity, and improved pricing.Revenue in the Middle East &amp; Asia of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to increased multidivisional activity across Asia and higher Reservoir Performance revenue in the Middle East. Year on year, revenue increased 15% due to increased multidivisional activity across Asia and higher activity from new projects in the Middle East—notably, increased drilling activity in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates and higher stimulation revenue in Oman.North AmericaNorth America revenue of $1.5 billion was essentially flat sequentially as double-digit growth in US land revenue was offset by reduced exploration data sales in the US Gulf of Mexico due to the significant transfer fees recorded in the previous quarter. US land revenue growth outperformed the rig count increase sequentially due to higher drilling activity, increased sales of well and surface production systems, and improved pricing.Compared to the same quarter last year, North America revenue grew 37%.

Our innovative solutions contribute to making the exploration and development of oil and gas assets more resilient and more efficient, with lower carbon and less impact on the environment. Examples from the quarter include:In East Texas, KJ Energy drilled seven wells in the Cotton Valley Formation fully remotely using Schlumberger technology to continuously increase the drilling efficiency in the curve-lateral production section well over well. The longest single run lateral was drilled using the fit-for-basin bottomhole assembly that included the PowerDrive Orbit G2* rotary steerable system, xBolt G2* accelerated drilling service, and AxeBlade* ridged diamond element bit. Other firsts for the basin were the fastest lateral and the longest lateral drilled without motor assistance. This performance helped KJ Energy attain 50% higher drilling efficiency compared to the conventional motor assemblies utilized to drill curves in the past.In Western Kazakhstan, Schlumberger technology helped Karachaganak Petroleum Operating B.V. (KPO) to avoid 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e emissions through zero-flaring techniques. Schlumberger deployed its surface pressure boosting package, a key part of its Production ExPRESS rapid production response solutions portfolio that requires no chemicals or well intervention. Conventional solutions often enable oil production while flaring the produced gas using methods that are both costly and result in increased emissions from flaring. Using technologies including the REDA Multiphase HPS horizontal multistage surface pump and the Vx Spectra surface multiphase flowmeter—both part of the Transition Technologies portfolio—flaring was completely eliminated, saving the gas instead for export. The integrated approach contributed to KPO being able to quickly bring wells back into production while commercializing gas that would have otherwise been flared.In Libya, Schlumberger conducted an intervention campaign with Mellitah Oil &amp; Gas that increased oil production by 4,000 bbl/d in the Bu Attifel Field. The success of this campaign led to the award of a 100-well production enhancement project. A joint team of Schlumberger and customer experts collaborated early in the intervention candidate selection process, increasing the likelihood of production and recovery increases through close collaboration, joint planning, and tight alignment on objectives. The best shut-in candidate wells were selected for intervention, and Schlumberger performed production and integrity logs to determine where to strategically set water shutoff plugs and reperforate production zones for maximum benefit. The treatment resulted in a production uplift that helped Mellitah Oil &amp; Gas achieve its production goals.In Kuwait, Schlumberger applied a fit-for-purpose combination of technologies for Kuwait Oil Company that unlocked resource potential of the northern area in Burgan Field. A bespoke new workflow using unique technologies was created to deliver a thin-bed evaluation across these formations. Advanced high-resolution petrophysics evaluation successfully confirmed oil production, which was then validated through quality samples along with reservoir productivity understanding using the Saturn* 3D radial probe.In Indonesia, Schlumberger used its novel EverCRETE* CO2-resistant cement system for Harbour Energy to maintain long-term well integrity in a deepwater exploration well with high CO2 content at water depth of around 4,200 ft. With a self-healing matrix that is reactive to CO2 exposure, the EverCRETE system also reduces potential remedial work in the case of a leak path developing. The use of the system for Harbour Energy reduced the project’s CO2 footprint by 63% when compared with traditional cement systems.In new energy technologies, Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to apply its domain expertise and experience in technology industrialization to be a leader in the energy transition at large. We continue to build partnerships across various industries to develop clean energy solutions.The Schlumberger New Energy business has secured an investment in ZEG Power to scale up the ZEG ICC™ technology for clean hydrogen production from hydrocarbon gas.

This collaboration will enable the lithium industry to meet surging mineral demand with a previously unattainable level of water utilization, by simultaneously lowering the consumption of freshwater and reducing wastewater. This technology integration can be applied to new lithium mineral extraction and production sites, opening opportunities to untapped lithium production regions, as well as existing lithium production operations.FINANCIAL TABLESCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income(Stated in millions, except per share amounts)Third QuarterNine MonthsPeriods Ended September 30,2022202120222021Revenue$7,477$5,847$20,213$16,704Interest &amp; other income (1)755643691ExpensesCost of revenue6,0424,86216,62314,135Research &amp; engineering160140456409General &amp; administrative9480277231Interest122130369402Income before taxes (1)$1,134$691$2,924$1,618Tax expense (1)215129514301Net income (1)$919$562$2,410$1,317Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest12123337Net income attributable to Schlumberger (1)$907$550$2,377$1,280Diluted earnings per share of Schlumberger (1)$0.63$0.39$1.65$0.90Average shares outstanding1,4181,4021,4141,399Average shares outstanding assuming dilution1,4391,4241,4361,422Depreciation &amp; amortization included in expenses (2)$533$530$1,598$1,588(1)See section entitled ""Charges &amp; Credits"" for details.(2)Includes depreciation of property, plant, and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs, and APS investments.Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet(Stated in millions)Sept. 30,Dec. 31,Assets20222021Current AssetsCash and short-term investments$3,609$3,139Receivables6,6505,315Inventories4,1433,272Other current assets1,20992815,61112,654Investment in affiliated companies1,7622,044Fixed assets6,4076,429Goodwill12,99012,990Intangible assets3,0433,211Other assets4,2804,183$44,093$41,511Liabilities and EquityCurrent LiabilitiesAccounts payable and accrued liabilities$9,034$8,382Estimated liability for taxes on income938879Short-term borrowings and current portionof long-term debt899909Dividends payable26318911,13410,359Long-term debt12,45213,286Postretirement benefits233231Other liabilities2,7632,34926,58226,225Equity17,51115,286$44,093$41,511Liquidity(Stated in millions)Components of LiquiditySept. 30,2022Jun. 30,2022Sept. 30,2021Dec. 31,2021Cash and short-term investments$3,609$2,816$2,942$3,139Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt(899)(901)(1,025)(909)Long-term debt(12,452)(12,946)(14,370)(13,286)Net Debt (1)$(9,742)$(11,031)$(12,453)$(11,056)Details of changes in liquidity follow:NineThirdNineMonthsQuarterMonthsPeriods Ended September 30,202220222021Net income$2,410$920$1,317Charges and credits, net of tax (2)(265)-(36)2,1459201,281Depreciation and amortization (3)1,5985331,588Stock-based compensation expense23676229Change in working capital(1,814)70(798)US federal tax refund--477Other(59)(32)(58)Cash flow from operations (4)2,1061,5672,719Capital expenditures(1,046)(382)(694)APS investments(420)(109)(305)Exploration data capitalized(77)(13)(21)Free cash flow (5)5631,0631,699Dividends paid(600)(248)(524)Proceeds from employee stock plans17178137Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed(45)(37)(98)Proceeds from sale of Liberty shares513--Proceeds from sale of real estate120--Taxes paid on net settled stock-based compensation awards(92)(7)(21)Other(118)(32)(58)Decrease in net debt before impact of changes in foreign exchange rates5128171,135Impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net debt802472292Decrease in Net Debt1,3141,2891,427Net Debt, beginning of period(11,056)(11,031)(13,880)Net Debt, end of period$(9,742)$(9,742)$(12,453)(1)""Net Debt"" represents gross debt less cash and short-term investments. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.(2)See section entitled ""Charges &amp; Credits"" for details.(3)Includes depreciation of property, plant, and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs, and APS investments.(4)Includes severance payments of $60 million and $22 million during the nine months and third quarter ended September 30, 2022, respectively; and $226 million and $42 million during the nine months and third quarter ended September 30, 2021, respectively.(5)""Free cash flow"" represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments, and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of Schlumberger’s ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.Charges &amp; CreditsIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this third-quarter 2022 earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC’s Regulation G). In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed under ""Liquidity"", net income, excluding charges &amp; credits, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted EPS, excluding charges &amp; credits; Schlumberger net income, excluding charges &amp; credits; effective tax rate, excluding charges &amp; credits; and adjusted EBITDA) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges &amp; credits from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively Schlumberger’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation.

SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL and Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Energy Stocks Poised to Outshine Earnings Estimates in Q3We are now at the beginning of the third-quarter earnings, with all the major oil companies yet to report results. As the pricing scenario was healthier year over year, better-than-expected results are expected from most of the energy players like Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Co. and Chesapeake Energy Corp.Favorable Q3 Oil PricePer data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), the average West Texas Intermediate crude prices in July, August and September were recorded at $101.62 per barrel, $93.67 per barrel and $84.26 per barrel, respectively. In comparison, in the year-ago respective months, average oil prices were reported at $72.49 per barrel, $67.73 per barrel and $71.65 per barrel, per the EIA’s data.Higher oil prices were favorable for exploration and production activities and convinced more explorers and producers to return to oil patches. The pricing scenario of natural gas was also healthy, depicting that the upstream business was lucrative in the third quarter.Per the Zacks Earnings Trends, the energy sector’s quarterly earnings will be $58.5 billion, significantly higher than $17.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021.How to Pick the Right Stocks?Given the backdrop and amid a large number of energy stocks, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at picks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While there is no fool-proof method of picking outperformers, our proprietary methodology — the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — helps identify stocks that have high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement.

131,1a10b568-42cf-30ec-ad3e-314258b5c073,PKG,2022-10-21,The past year for Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-packaging-corporation-america-nyse-115121618.html,1666353081,STORY,['PKG'],"[It's normal to be annoyed when stock you own has a declining share price. But sometimes a share price fall can have more to do with market conditions than the performance of the specific business. The Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) is down 16% over a year, but the total shareholder return is -13% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 24%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 4.0% higher than it was three years ago. The share price has dropped 20% in three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the Packaging Corporation of America share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Packaging Corporation of America's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthPackaging Corporation of America is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Packaging Corporation of America in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it has a TSR of -13% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Packaging Corporation of America shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 13% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 2%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Packaging Corporation of America (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.We will like Packaging Corporation of America better if we see some big insider buys.

HOLX is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 31, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37.68%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 54.09%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsWith COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have registered a sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, Hologic might have gained from the growing adoption of Panther instruments. The company’s efforts to validate and run more non-COVID assays on Panther systems might have offset the COVID-led loss to some extent. Further, its performance might have been driven bya combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. In this regard, in the last reported quarter, Hologic’s vaginitis panel continued to outperform and deliver impressive growth, based on which the company noted that this vaginitis panel is well-positioned to become a top-three women's health assay within the molecular diagnostics portfolio. This might once again get reflected in the fiscal Q4 results.Breast HealthIn recent months, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage has aggravated due to persistent supply chain issues and the current geopolitical environment. This is likely to have impacted Hologic’s Breast Health business as it did in the prior-reported fiscal third quarter. The company’s interventional business has been facing supply chain headwinds related to disposable biopsy needles, hampering its performance.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteDespite these challenges, the company noted that the underlying demand for its Breast Health products remained robust, measured by healthy orders and rising backlog growth. This trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, benefiting the business arm.Story continuesGYN SurgicalHologic’s GYN Surgical business arm is likely to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures with the full-fledged opening up of the economy. The business is expected to have benefited from its acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder Surgical. Accessa's growth is driven primarily by two factors: first, its efforts to increase patient-covered lives to 84% compared with 26% when Hologic first acquired the business about two years ago. Second, its growth is also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Further, similar to the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate strong contributions from Bolder's CoolSeal devices to have added to the top-line performance.

It befits global companies to review the issue more proactively,"" lawmaker Hong Suk-joon said during the hearing.Others disagreed, saying imposing fees on the big tech companies could mean they could raise their own fees and undermine South Korean content creators.""It risks the collapse of domestic content providers while trying to protect a small number of domestic internet service providers,"" said Jung Chung-rae, head of the parliament committee overseeing the issue.Google's YouTube has campaigned against the bill and more than 259,824 people have signed a petition opposing the legislation, according to activist group Opennet.""It will be necessary to deeply review the way the business is run,"" Google South Korea's country director Kyoung Hoon Kim told lawmakers, referring to what would happen if such legislation was introduced.Liz Chung, a director at Netflix's South Korean unit, said her company was looking for ways to handle surging traffic.""We are developing a number of technical measures to efficiently utilise networks and respond appropriately to traffic growth,"" Chung said.Story continuesIn Europe, a regulators' plan to make Google, Meta and Netflix bear some telecoms network costs has been welcomed by big telecoms operators, but smaller ones warned it would distort the telecoms market and harm competition.It costs money to establish and maintain subsea cables and infrastructure that bring data from one place to another and the exploding popularity of global video content has raised the costs of bringing data stored overseas, experts said.YouTube has 41.8 million active South Korean users, out of a population of 51.6 million. They used YouTube for a combined 1.38 billion hours in September, according to data provider Mobile Index.Global mobile data traffic reached 67 exabytes per month by the end of 2021, projected to reach 282 exabytes in 2027, Sweden's Ericsson said in a June report. Video traffic accounts for about 69% of the traffic, and is expected to rise to 79% in 2027.South Korean network provider SK Broadband has gone to court in the hope of making Big Tech pay fees.SK declined to comment.""(Legislation) could have repercussions including content providers passing on costs to end-users,"" said Kim Hyun-kyung, professor at Seoul National University of Science and Technology.(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

Sales were up 6% from the prior year at $7.9 billion to narrowly beat revenue expectations. Outside of the beat on both its top and bottom lines, Netflix posted subscriber growth.Subscriber GrowthNetflix added 2.41 million subscribers during the third quarter. This more than doubled the expected 1.09 million subscribers and was a delight to investors. Netflix’s Asia-Pacific region accounted for the majority of the growth with 1.43 million subscribers added.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSubscriber growth was crucial for Wall Street to see after the company had two consecutive quarters of shrinking subscriber growth. This caused NFLX stock to fall mightily earlier in the year despite beating earnings expectations. The loss of 200,000 subscribers in Q1 was the company’s first decline in paying customers in over a decade. This was followed by another loss of almost 1 million subscribers in Q2 this year.It is important to note that Netflix said its most recent Q3 release would be the last quarter in which the company provides guidance for its paid subscribers. However, subscriber data will be provided during the company’s quarterly earnings release.In Netflix’s final forecast the company predicted they would add 4.5 million subscribers in Q4. The company said revenue growth will be its main focus and priority going forward rather than subscriber guidance and data.Revenue Growth Netflix’s Q3 revenue was driven by a 5% increase in average paid memberships and a 1% rise in Average Revenue per Membership (ARM). The company also recently announced the launch of its paid advertising subscriptions tier at a lower cost of $6.99 per month. This could help grow its average paid memberships and ARMs. Netflix has implemented the ad-supported service in 12 countries thus far.The addition of advertising revenue is expected to eventually bring in billions for Netflix. Netflix’s guidance for Q4 has revenue at $7.8 billion with the company saying the forecast is driven by an expectation of 4.5 million paid net adds and ARM growth of 6% year over year. Netflix is optimistic about the new advertising business but doesn’t expect a material contribution in the fourth quarter as the plan is to grow membership in the plan over time.Story continuesAlthough the implementation of advertising subscriptions won’t have a major effect on Q4 revenue, it should eventually put the company in a great position to continue growing and compete for higher ad revenue with big tech companies like Alphabet GOOGL. Alphabet makes billions in revenue from its YouTube ad service alone. To put it in context, Alphabet’s YouTube ad sales of $8.63 billion in Q4 2021 were more than Netflix’s total revenue for the quarter.Performance &amp; Valuation NFLX is up roughly 7% following its solid Q3 earnings release. NFLX shares are still down -59% over the last year to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -20%. However, over the last decade, NFLX is up a stellar +2,591%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter the rally, NFLX now has a P/E of 27.2X. This is well below its 65.1X high over the last year and near the median of 25.9X. Even better, NFLX still trades very reasonably compared to its decade-high of 2,640X and the median of 111.9X. Plus, considering NFLX is a stock Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a high premium for; its current valuation is not far from the broader market. Netflix is starting to trade more like the mature tech company it is with its days of 20% or higher revenue growth likely over.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line Netflix’s final guidance on subscriber numbers showed the company should continue growing just at a slower rate than in the past. On top of that, the implementation of its paid ad subscription service could bring billions of additional revenue down the line.Netflix currently looks poised for near-term growth as well. Year over year, NFLX earnings are now projected to be down -10% in 2022 but climb 8% in FY23 at $10.94 per share. Top line growth is expected, with FY22 sales projected to climb 6% and another 7% in FY23 to $33.90 billion.NFLX currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its FY23 outlook showing the company does appear to be growing again. Netflix’s Broadcast Radio and Televisions Industry is also in the top 35% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America.

D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.4 million shares valued at $282 million.  Black Bear Value Partners released its Q3 2020 investor letter and mentioned Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Here is what it said: “PSX has been a top 5 position in years past. Its long-term value is similar to when we last owned it but is down 50+% in price in sympathy with broader energy concerns.PSX is an integrated energy company with 4 central divisions: refining, chemicals, midstream (pipelines etc.) and marketing (gas stations). Due to downstream demand destruction, the refining business is taking it on the chin. This could persist for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As in years past, a lot of focus is given to the refining business as it has historically been the lion’s share of the value for PSX. Management has invested in the non-refining businesses who now make up most of the value of the company.Management is extremely thoughtful with capital allocation and has focused on a healthy balance sheet with opportunistic share repurchases. They do not spend capex on projects unless they meet a healthy margin of safety for returns.PSX should be able to generate substantial amounts of cash in the coming years and generate a 15+% free cash flow yield on quarter-end pricing. If the stock remains low, management will be buying a lot of stock.”8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of October 19: 3.82%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas, is one of the elite income stocks to consider. In a bid to expand its global renewables portfolio, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced on September 28 that it had entered the African power sector by purchasing the Nigerian renewable energy provider, Daystar Power, for an undisclosed sum.JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek on October 13 reiterated an Overweight rating on  Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), with collective stakes worth $3.4 billion, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter worth $5.6 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares valued at $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has found its Siberian oil and gas joint venture assets stranded by the combination of sanctions and the public opprobrium of Russia’s actions.”7. FirstEnergy Corp.

(NYSE:FE), up from 33 funds in the earlier quarter. Carl Icahn’s Icahn Capital LP is the leading stakeholder of the company, with approximately 19 million shares worth $728 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Global Infrastructure Income Strategy has to say about FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On a regional level, the Strategy’s largest exposure is in the U.S. and Canada (44%), consisting of regulated and contracted utilities (31%) and economically sensitive user-pays infrastructure (13%).During the quarter we initiated new positions in U.S. electric utility FirstEnergy.  With supply chain issues, higher housing costs, higher commodity prices and producer price inflation remaining square in the sights for 2022, we think higher inflation is a risk for global markets. We expect growth to slow to trend or below by mid-2022 and U.S.”6.

(NYSE:C), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is one of the top dividend stocks to invest in. Here is what First Eagle Investments Global Fund has to say about Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Colorado-based Newmont, the largest gold miner in the world, experienced weakness in the quarter as falling gold bullion prices and cost inflation hurt miners in general. More idiosyncratically, the company reported slightly disappointing earnings and production results for its most recent quarter due to pandemic-related disruptions, ongoing supply-chain constraints, and labor shortages.It also warned that operating costs for 2022 were likely to come in at the upper end of previous guidance. We remain constructive on the stock, which offers steady production anchored in good jurisdictions, a good pipeline of organic projects, a strong balance sheet, and proven management.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Income Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:10 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds10 Oil Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Income Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Amgen as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Amgen peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Amgen will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Amgen's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Amgen would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 20% gain to the company's bottom line. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 3.1% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 13% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.3% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Amgen's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On Amgen's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Amgen's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 2 warning signs for Amgen that we have uncovered.If you're unsure about the strength of Amgen's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ: CCXI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on orally administered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer, for $52 per share in cash, representing aggregate merger consideration of approximately $3.7 billion.""ChemoCentryx enhances Amgen's leading inflammation and nephrology portfolio and includes TAVNEOS® (avacopan), a first-in-class treatment for severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (ANCA-associated vasculitis), an autoimmune disease for which there remains significant unmet medical need,"" said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen. ""We look forward to welcoming the dedicated professionals from ChemoCentryx who share our passion for advancing innovation that makes a difference for patients. Together, we aim to serve more patients affected by serious diseases.""The acquisition includes TAVNEOS®, an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2021 as an adjunctive therapy for adults with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis in addition to standard of care, which generally consists of glucocorticoids and either rituximab or cyclophosphamide immunosuppressant therapy. Beyond its approved ANCA-associated vasculitis indication, TAVNEOS® is also being studied in additional inflammatory diseases, including hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a severe and deforming chronic dermatological condition, and complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a rare genetic kidney disease.In addition to TAVNEOS®, the acquisition adds three early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors and other inflammatory diseases and an oral checkpoint for cancer.Story continuesAbout Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives.

In the United States, ChemoCentryx markets TAVNEOS® (avacopan), the first approved orally administered inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis. TAVNEOS is also in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additionally, ChemoCentryx has early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in cancer. For more information about ChemoCentryx visit www.chemocentryx.com.About TAVNEOS® (avacopan)TAVNEOS (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, is a first-in-class, orally administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA vasculitis has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis. TAVNEOS's selective inhibition of only the C5aR leaves the beneficial C5a pathway through the C5L2 receptor functioning normally.ChemoCentryx is also developing TAVNEOS for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and lupus nephritis (LN). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted TAVNEOS orphan drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for TAVNEOS for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), as well as for C3G.About ANCA-Associated VasculitisANCA-associated vasculitis is an umbrella term for a group of multi-system autoimmune diseases with small vessel inflammation. Inflamed vessels may rupture or become occluded giving rise to a broad array of clinical symptoms and signs related to a systemic inflammatory response which may result in profound injury and dysfunction in the kidneys, lungs and other organs. Prior to the approval of TAVNEOS, treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis was limited to courses of non-specific immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time, which can be associated with significant clinical risk including death from infection.U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATIONTAVNEOS (avacopan) is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindicationsSerious hypersensitivity to avacopan or to any of the excipientsWarning and PrecautionsHepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.Drug InteractionsAvoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of certain sensitive CYP3A4 substrates.Please see Full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide.Amgen Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen.

Retail traders often invest in growth firms and do not pursue value-oriented dividend stocks. However, as interest rates rise and inflation shows no signs of slowing down, a value-friendly marketplace, where stocks like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) are trending on the up, has forced these retail traders to consider dividend-paying firms as investment options in order to protect their growth-heavy portfolios from being obliterated in the current macro environment. Even Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) shares are down 45% year-to-date. Despite the fall, hedge funds continue to bet on the long-term potential of the stock.

Here is what the fund said:“International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.One cannot overstate how powerful IBM was in the computer industry in the 1950s and 1960s. Every competitor rightly worried that if their product worked too well for too long, it was only a matter of time before an army of IBM salesforce representatives mobilized. In their easily recognizable uniforms of starched white shirts, red ties and blue suits, IBM marketers marched on their customers and offered a more expensive, but much more defensible, choice. “Nobody gets fired for buying IBM” was a common phrase. Even competitors acknowledged that the company excelled at sales. As a UNIVAC executive once complained, ‘It doesn’t do much good to build a better mousetrap if the other guy selling mousetraps has five times as many salesmen.’” (read more)7. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55   Dividend Yield as of October 20: 3.13%   Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide. It is one of the major dividend stocks to invest in. On October 17, Evotec and Toronto Innovation Partners stated that they have expanded their transnational BRIDGE partnership LAB150 to include Amgen as a strategic partner.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) stock and lowered the price target on Amgen to $234 from $236, noting that there was another round of challenging setups for biopharmaceuticals in Q3. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the pharmaceutical company focused on biotechnology-based therapeutics, was also a top contributor for the quarter. The company reported solid results, with a variety of products, such as bone-strengthening drugs Prolia and EVENITY, contributing to overall revenue growth. Amgen continued to increase the market share for cholesterol drug Repatha (a catalyst we had originally identified), delivering record quarterly sales as the drug’s usage expands with high-risk patients who have not yet had a cardiovascular event, and as barriers for prescribers, healthcare systems and patients are removed. In addition, we believe the company is poised to gain market share with its biosimilars (akin to generic versions of biologic drugs), also a previously identified catalyst. Biosimilars accounted for over $2 billion in revenue in 2021, and we believe this has the potential to more than double by the end of the decade, accelerated by six additional biosimilars (for a total of 11 products on the market). This includes the upcoming launch in the U.S. of arthritis treatment Amjetiva in January 2023. Meanwhile, the company is advancing its robust pipeline of early- and late-stage assets, with several phase III results due this year. These developments have caused us to remain enthusiastic about Amgen’s ability to build on its decades of success developing novel treatments using biopharmaceuticals.”6. Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:VZ) stock to Outperform from Perform with a $50 price target, highlighting the gradual stabilization-to-growth of the company's subscriber base. Along with Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Mawar Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Verizon Communication Inc. (NYSE:VZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Dividend Stocks on Robinhood. Suggested Articles:20 Cheapest States To Live In The USTop 10 Losers Today10 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore Disclosure.

AMGN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 21, 2022 $120 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amgen shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter moved from $4.51 per share to $4.50.Given the way analysts feel about Amgen right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

He has acquired gold, utilities, and consumer staples while boosting cash stockpiles and slashing technology positions. He noted that currently, the aim should not be to outperform the market, rather damage control should be prioritized. Marguerita Cheng, a CFP and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Maryland, has been watching dividend stocks.

Enbridge and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”10.

Its long-term value is similar to when we last owned it but is down 50+% in price in sympathy with broader energy concerns.PSX is an integrated energy company with 4 central divisions: refining, chemicals, midstream (pipelines etc.) and marketing (gas stations). Due to downstream demand destruction, the refining business is taking it on the chin. This could persist for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As in years past, a lot of focus is given to the refining business as it has historically been the lion’s share of the value for PSX. Management has invested in the non-refining businesses who now make up most of the value of the company.Management is extremely thoughtful with capital allocation and has focused on a healthy balance sheet with opportunistic share repurchases. They do not spend capex on projects unless they meet a healthy margin of safety for returns.PSX should be able to generate substantial amounts of cash in the coming years and generate a 15+% free cash flow yield on quarter-end pricing. If the stock remains low, management will be buying a lot of stock.”8. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Dividend Yield as of October 19: 3.82%Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas, is one of the elite income stocks to consider. In a bid to expand its global renewables portfolio, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) announced on September 28 that it had entered the African power sector by purchasing the Nigerian renewable energy provider, Daystar Power, for an undisclosed sum.JPMorgan analyst Christyan Malek on October 13 reiterated an Overweight rating on  Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), with collective stakes worth $3.4 billion, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter worth $5.6 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 20.25 million shares valued at $1.06 billion. Here is what Harding Loevner International Equity Fund has to say about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“While risks of unforeseen consequences arising from the Ukraine conflict are high, on this front we are cautiously optimistic that China will work hard to maintain its neutrality in a credible way, as it is a huge beneficiary of trade with the rest of the world, especially the rich developed nations. We think it likely that China, along with India, will continue to buy oil and gas from Russia (just as Europe, at least for now, plans to keep its gas pipelines open), and do not expect that fact to alter China’s trade relations with the West much. Nevertheless, we must contemplate that our optimism is misplaced on the importance of membership in the global network of exchange. If our central and optimistic case—admittedly an educated guess—is wrong, then we’d need to greatly modify our views of which companies in our opportunity set will face new barriers to profitable growth, and which might stand to benefit, relatively, from a further receding of globalization. (Global trade, after all, has never matched the peak share of GDP it reached in 2008, before the Global Financial Crisis.) We’d expect such a world to be less efficient, as the cold logic of comparative advantage is demoted as a determinant of which goods or services are produced and where. That would lead to a less prosperous world, since exploiting comparative advantage is a cornerstone of wealth creation. If regional blocs began to raise limits on the movement of capital as well as goods, we’d need to parse which of our multinational companies were at risk of declining sales from increasingly hostile, siloed countries.

153,ace26b9a-3d93-3542-a518-fcd05a74fe2b,GD,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: Northrop Grumman (NOC) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-northrop-grumman-noc-140202084.html,1666274522,STORY,"['NOC', 'GD']","[Northrop Grumman (NOC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.8%.Revenues are expected to be $9.15 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.34% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman?For Northrop Grumman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of $6.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.06, delivering a surprise of +0.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northrop Grumman doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerGeneral Dynamics (GD), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.16 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $9.92 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for General Dynamics has been revised 0.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.61%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The strong growth in revenues across most of its business segments is likely to positively impact its third-quarter results.Aerospace Unit to Boost the Overall Top LineIncreased global air travel demand is likely to have contributed to General Dynamics’ Aerospace business unit sales performance, mainly due to the increased demand for maintenance work and activity at its fixed-base operator facilities. Improved aircraft deliveries may also have added impetus to its third-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $2,183 million, indicating a 5.7% improvement from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Marine Systems to Contribute to Overall SalesMarine Systems’ revenues are likely to have been positively impacted by the increased demand for shipbuilding from the U.S. Navy in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In particular, the construction and repair volume for ships is likely to boost this segment’s third-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Marine segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $2,708 million, indicating a 2.7% increase from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.U.S. Stryker to Boost Combat Systems SalesIncreased revenues from U.S. Stryker wheeled combat vehicles are expected to have contributed to third-quarter revenues of Combat Systems. Also, strong orders and international orders for Abrams are likely to have added impetus to the top line of the segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Combat Systems segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $1,797 million, indicating a 3% improvement from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Technologies Unit RevenuesStrong order activity and a pipeline, buoyed by the government initiative to continue to modernize and upgrade mission support systems, are likely to have benefited the Technologies segment’s sales performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHowever, supply-chain shortages and delays in customer order activity might have impacted revenues from C5ISR solutions, thus partially damping the performance of revenues from this segment in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Technologies segment’s revenues in the third quarter is pegged at $3,285 million, indicating 5.3% growth from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Other Factors to NoteThe impressive sales performance across all its segments makes us optimistic about GD’s overall top line in the third quarter. This, in turn, is likely to have aided the bottom line of the company in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, the shortage of chips may have continued to plague the company’s ability to deliver certain products in the third quarter as well, thereby partly impacting overall results.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation price-eps-surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteQ3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.93 billion, suggesting growth of 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.16 per share, indicating growth of 2.9% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Dynamics this time. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat.

(due to) a 44% jump in LNG imports to Northeast Asia this week, suggesting a ramp-up in restocking for winter,"" said Ryhana Rasidi, gas and LNG analyst at data analytics firm Kpler.In China, state-owned gas importers were instructed to stop reselling cargoes to buyers in Europe and Asia to ensure sufficient supplies for winter.Spot activity saw a Korean end-user purchasing several cargoes for December and January delivery, while Japanese utilities were involved in sales of late-December cargoes, at slight premiums to the JKM (Japan Korea Marker benchmark) monthly average, according to Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.In Europe, S&amp;P assessed its daily DES Northwest Europe LNG price benchmark, for cargoes delivered in December on ex-ship (DES) basis, at $29.873/mmBtu on Oct. 20, a discount of $13.50/mmBtu to the December gas price at the Dutch TTF hub.""Floating LNG carriers off the coast of Europe are pressuring prompt LNG cargo values, which for November deliveries to European terminals are in the teens per mmBtu,"" Roe said.""The contango between November and December values is significant, with European LNG cargo prices for December remaining competitive against Asia for U.S.-origin LNG, even accounting for the surging spot freight costs.""Contango is where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price.Around 35 ships carrying LNG have been drifting off the coast of Spain and around the Mediterranean due to a lack of slots to unload, exposing Europe's lack of regasification capacity.Story continues""Right now, it makes sense to wait in Europe due to the contango. What is unlikely for now is re-routes to Asia as prices are lower than in Europe and freight is astronomical and wouldn't be offset,"" said Toby Copson, global head of trading and advisory at Trident LNG.European players are closely monitoring any disruption from Nigeria LNG (NLNG) after it declared force majeure due to widespread flooding.Lee Ken Kiat, senior analyst for gas and LNG at consultancy FGE, said the market should expect a further upside risk for prices if the outage is prolonged and if there was any delay in the partial restart of U.S. Freeport LNG, which halted operations in June after an explosion and fire.On LNG freight, spot rates in both the Atlantic and the Pacific basins hit new record highs as the market tightened further, with the Atlantic rate gaining $56,750 to $482,500/day and the Pacific rate rising $34,500 to 427,000/day, according to Henry Bennett, global head of pricing at Spark Commodities.

We are expecting Total to return by next year,"" INP said on Friday.The regulator said ExxonMobil, which had indicated it would only resume a final investment decision on its own LNG project in Area 4 of the Rovuma basin once Total had lifted its force majeure, was also seen returning to its project early in 2023.""This also means that we won't have stranded resources in Rovuma Basin at the same time that we know that natural gas is playing an important role as an energy for transition,"" it said.INP will launch a new oil and gas licensing round next year with details still to be worked out. The winners of the current 6th bidding auction is on track to be announced on Dec. 30, it added.

BTU, Alliance Resource Partners L.P. ARLP, CONSOL Energy CEIX and Warrior Met Coal Inc. HCC.Industry: CoalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1994628/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-still-attractive-coal-industryThe Zacks Coal industry stocks have staged a rebound courtesy of global demand after the pandemic-led lockdowns and surging natural gas prices.  Improving coal prices and demand boosted the profit levels of coal operators. Demand for coal might continue to improve for the next few years as clean energy sources may not be able to fill the increase in energy demand.With higher global economic activity, electricity demand is rising, and utility operators are buying more coal to boost production. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is creating fresh demand from coal importing countries and pushing up coal prices.As global steel production improves, coal stocks like Peabody Energy Corp., Alliance Resource Partners L.P., CONSOL Energy and Warrior Met Caol Inc. are expected to gain.About the IndustryThe Zacks Coal industry comprises companies involved in the discovery and mining of coal. Coal is mined by either the opencast or the underground method. The commodity is valued for its energy content and used worldwide to generate electricity, and manufacture steel and cement. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the current U.S. estimated recoverable coal reserves are about 252 billion short tons, of which about 58% is underground mineable coal.Given the current production rates, coal resources are likely to last many more years. Five states in the United States contribute nearly 70% of yearly production and 60% of coal production from surface mining. Per EIA, the coal industry may benefit from the rise in natural gas prices in the United States. This would result in additional demand for coal.Story continues3 Trends Likely to Impact the Coal IndustryCoal to Benefit From Steel Industry Demand:  The improvement in coal exports is boosting the prospect of U.S. coal miners.  The rollout of vaccines and easing of pandemic-related restrictions have revived industrial and commercial activities across the globe, spurring electricity demand. EIA expects U.S. coal production volumes to increase 20 millions of short tons (MMst) in 2022 and touch 598 MMst.Per the World Steel Association, global steel demand would contract 2.3% in 2022 to reach 1,796.7 Mt due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Steel production is expected to improve 1% in 2023 to reach 1814.7 Mt and boost the prospects of the coal operators.Global Coal Demand and Prices to Move Upward: Coal was continuously losing ground to natural gas and other renewable energy as a fuel source, but a global economic recovery in 2021 resulted in a rebound in demand. Per the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), the demand for coal can attain new highs in 2022 due to a rebound in the global economy, aided by demand arising from the Asian countries.Even though the rising usage of renewable energy will pose a big challenge for coal, the demand and use of the commodity may not fall in Asian economies. This, in turn, would continue to boost the prospects of U.S. coal miners. The ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has hampered the supply of coal volumes from Russia to other countries, creating coal export opportunities for U.S. coal producers. Taking into consideration all factors, IEA expects global coal demand to increase 0.7% from 2021 to 8 billion tons in 2022 and improve further in 2023.New Emission Policy Will Hurt Coal Industry: The improvement in demand for coal is expected to be short-lived as the new environmental policy will target 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, which will significantly lower demand for coal from the U.S. electricity space. Per EIA, coal-fired electricity generation would drop from 23% U.S. total in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and 19% in 2023. Unless utility operators invest heavily in pollution-control measures to reduce emissions from power plants, domestic coal usage would fall significantly.Going forward, coal industry operators are likely to face many difficulties as a number of electric utilities have decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 and completely cut down coal usage. Per EIA, total coal consumption in the United States will drop 5.1% in 2022 to 518.1 MMst and further by 6% to 487 MMst in 2023.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Coal industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil and Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #16, which places it in the top 6% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong performance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since December 2021, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have gone up 52.7%.Before we present a few coal stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Coal industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the Zacks Oil and Gas sector over the past 12 months.The stocks in the coal industry have gained 67.6% compared with the Zacks Oil-Energy sector’s growth of 19.6%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 19.2% in the same time frame.Coal Industry's Current ValuationSince coal companies have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.The industry is currently trading at a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.22X compared with the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 14.4X and the sector’s 3.48X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 7.6X, as low as 2.87X and at the median of 4.81X.4 Coal Industry Stocks to Keep a Close Watch OnPeabody Energy: St Louis, MO-based Peabody Energy engages in the coal mining business and has both thermal and metallurgical operations. In 2021, nearly 26% of the company’s revenues were derived from five customers with whom it still has 17 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various periods from 2022 to 2026. This assures a steady flow of revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Peabody Energy’s 2022 earnings and revenues suggests a year-over-year rise of 130.3% and 38.5%, respectively.  Over the past 60 days, this company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has gone up 8%. The stock has gained 17.3% over the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 14%.Peabody Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ARLP earns royalty income from coal produced by its mining complexes and royalty income from mineral interests it owns in different basins. The firm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings per unit and revenues implies a year-over-year rise of 226.5% and 53.2%, respectively.  The stock has gained 10.1% over the past three months.CONSOL Energy: Canonsburg, PA-based CONSOL Energy, sports a Zacks Rank of 1, produces and exports bituminous thermal coal.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Zoetis are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that JAZZ has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.JAZZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.63, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 29.69. We also note that JAZZ has a PEG ratio of 0.68. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.59.Another notable valuation metric for JAZZ is its P/B ratio of 2.58. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 15.14.Based on these metrics and many more, JAZZ holds a Value grade of B, while ZTS has a Value grade of C.JAZZ has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZTS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that JAZZ is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

166,441739ea-a1d1-39b7-b72e-8c145eef6ddf,SPGI,2022-10-21,Analysts Estimate S&P Global (SPGI) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-p-global-spgi-140202699.html,1666274522,STORY,"['SPGI', 'TRU']","[The market expects S&amp;P Global (SPGI) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -21.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.91 billion, up 39.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S&amp;P Global?For S&amp;P Global, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that S&amp;P Global will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that S&amp;P Global would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.81, delivering a surprise of -3.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.S&amp;P Global doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTransUnion (TRU), another stock in the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -8.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $943.83 million, up 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for TransUnion has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TransUnion will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the processor of debit and credit card payments had lost 2.21% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Business Services sector's loss of 8.94% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.13% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from MasterCard as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.57, up 8.44% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.65 billion, up 13.37% from the year-ago period.MA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.60 per share and revenue of $22.19 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +26.19% and +17.51%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for MasterCard. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.3% lower. MasterCard is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, MasterCard is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.09. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.42, so we one might conclude that MasterCard is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that MA has a PEG ratio of 1.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial Transaction Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.93 as of yesterday's close.The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 156, putting it in the bottom 39% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MasterCard?For MasterCard, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MasterCard will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MasterCard would post earnings of $2.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.56, delivering a surprise of +8.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MasterCard doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

173,521abe1a-8c4c-3671-a306-22db85039b5b,EXPE,2022-10-21,Expedia and Google Disagree on Best Day to Book Flights,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-google-disagree-best-day-173000979.html,1666287000,STORY,"['EXPE', 'GOOGL']","[Even some of the largest holders of consumer data, Expedia and Google, can't agree on the best day to book a flight. Pictured is Singapore Changi Airport. Changi Airport GroupIn the battle for the hearts and wallets of travelers intent on booking cheap flights, Expedia and Google disagree on the best day of the week to book a flight.Expedia, in partnership with the Airlines Reporting Corp., said Sundays are the best, while Google basically said that’s false because there’s really no particular day of the week to find the cheapest flight.The three companies, Expedia, the Airlines Reporting Corp., and Google didn’t discuss the issue during a travel industry or tech roundtable, but released dueling reports on booking and flying trends in the last two months.Based on Airlines Reporting Corp. data for roundtrip airfares for flights beginning in the U.S. from January to August this year, Expedia issued a report Wednesday that counseled flyers to book on Sundays to save around 5 percent on U.S. domestic flights and up to 15 percent on international flights on average versus booking on Fridays.In its own blog post on similar themes that it released August 31, Google, leveraging five years of airline fare data, essentially scoffed at the notion that there is a best day to book. [See Google’s methodology below.]“There isn’t much value in purchasing your tickets on a certain day of the week — sorry, Tuesday!” Google wrote.In fact, while Expedia looked to Sundays for discounts of up to 15 percent on average on U.S. originating international flights versus booking on Fridays, Google stated that over the last five years flyers could find smallish deals that averaged nearly 2 percent lower when booked midweek versus on the weekends.Not to quibble, but the two reports also disagreed about Mondays.Monday, Monday.Expedia advised travelers to avoid departures on Saturdays through Mondays, “which are the priciest days,” but Google wrote that Monday departures can be relatively cheap.“On average, flights that depart on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday have been 12 percent cheaper than weekend departures,” Google wrote. “If you exclude international destinations, the potential savings jump even higher to 20 percent.”Story continuesThe two reports agreed that it’s wise to book flights well in advance and to avoid last-minute bookings, but they offered different details on the timing.The Expedia-Airlines Reporting Corp. report urged flyers to book domestic flights “at least one month” prior to departure, and international flights six months ahead to save an average of 10 percent compared with procrastinating flyers or those who had to book at the last minute.Google, on the other hand, said airfares are usually at their lowest on average 44 days before a domestic flight, and regularly are at their cheapest 21-60 days ahead.Common GroundWhat Expedia and Google agree on is that publishing reports on the best times to book is an opportune time for self-promotion.Expedia urged travelers to use the Expedia app’s price tracking and predictions feature for notifications about airfare changes.Google, meanwhile, mined a similar theme.“Toggle on tracking for your destination and dates of travel, and we’ll email you if prices change substantially,” the Google blog stated. “Or, if you’re more flexible on when to travel, you can turn on tracking for ‘Any dates’ to get notified of price drops for flights departing in the next 3 to 6 months.”Note: Google stated it used the following methodology for its findings: “To produce the insights in this post, we calculated average round trip airfares observed Aug 1, 2017 through Aug 1, 2022 on Google Flights, for 6- to 9-day trips and 13- to 16-day trips departing from the top 4,000 markets in the U.S. For Thanksgiving and Christmas, we examined 6- to 9-day trips and 13- to 16-day trips with departure dates before the holiday and return dates after the holiday. For spring break, we examined 6- to 9-day trips and 13- to 16-day trips beginning in March or April, and for summer vacation we examined 6- to 9-day trips and 13- to 16-day trips beginning in July or August.“Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$13m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$444. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Lockheed Martin. In total, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Lockheed Martin Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$73m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Lockheed Martin makes money, and is growing profits. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin you should be aware of.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This order includes spacecraft, mission planning and support, and takes us into the 2030s,"" said Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager for Commercial Civil Space, Lockheed Martin. ""We're on the eve of a historic launch kicking off the Artemis era and this contract shows NASA is making long-term plans toward living and working on the Moon, while also having a forward focus on getting humans to Mars.""This order marks the second three missions under the agency's Orion Production and Operations Contract (OPOC), an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for up to 12 vehicles. A breakout of these orders includes:2019: NASA initiates OPOC IDIQ and orders three Orion spacecraft for Artemis missions III-V.2022: NASA orders three additional Orion spacecraft missions for Artemis VI-VIII for $1.99 billion.In the future: NASA can order an additional six Orion missions.Under OPOC, Lockheed Martin and NASA have reduced the costs on Orion by 50% per vehicle on Artemis III through Artemis V, compared to vehicles built during the design and development phase. The vehicles built for Artemis VI, VII and VIII will see an additional 30% cost reduction.Story continues""We're achieving substantial cost savings from Artemis III through Artemis VIII by extensive structure and system reuse and incorporating advanced digital design and manufacturing processes,"" said Tonya Ladwig, Orion vice president and program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. ""The Artemis II vehicle will reuse select avionics from the Artemis I crew module, and that reuse will continue to dramatically increase to where the Artemis III pressure vessel capsule will be entirely refurbished for the Artemis VI mission.""Additionally, the company will drive out cost from these production vehicles through material and component bulk buys from suppliers and an accelerated mission cadence.With the Artemis I Orion spacecraft currently on top of the Space Launch System rocket, there are two other Orion vehicles undergoing assembly at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Artemis II and III. Work is well under way on the Artemis IV craft including welding the pressure vessel together at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans and the heat shield at Lockheed Martin's facility near Denver, and work has already begun on the Artemis V vehicle.More information about OrionLockheed Martin Orion page: https://www.lockheedmartin.com/orionNASA Orion page: https://www.nasa.gov/orionAbout Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

If you want to read about some more military drone stocks, check out 5 Best Military Drone Stocks to Invest In.Drone technology has exploded into the mainstream ever since the United States government granted exemptions to companies to operate drones in the fields of insurance, construction, and agriculture, expanding the scope of the drone tech outside the military space. The Federal Aviation Administration also helped devise a regulatory framework for commercial drones to help the market further. Since then, tech firms have been doing all they can to bring drone tech to as many businesses as possible.  However, even as the drone market expands, defense firms like Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) remain some of the biggest manufacturers of the unmanned air vehicles. According to data collected by Research and Markets, the drone services market size is expected to grow to more than $63 billion by 2025 as consumer drone shipments cross the 30 million mark in 2022. Even large investment advisors are bullish on the drone sector. Goldman Sachs forecasts the total drone market size will be worth $100 billion in the coming years on the back of the growing demand for drones from the commercial and government sectors. Similarly, Markets and Markets research shows that the drone sector will reach a value of over $58 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of more than 16% from 2021. The market for small drones is also expanding and will reach $22.55 billion in value by 2026. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the military drone sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Military Drone Stocks to Invest InPhotobank gallery/Shutterstock.comBest Military Drone Stocks To Invest In10. EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2    EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) operates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) technology platform company in the People’s Republic of China, East Asia, Europe, and internationally. It is one of the best drone stocks to invest in. On October 13, EHang Holdings stated that its EH216 AAV has performed successful flight demonstrations in Spain under the European Union’s Air Mobility Urban Large Experimental Demonstration project.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 2 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $8.5 million in EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH), compared to 2 the preceding quarter worth $12.9 million.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Marshall Wace LLP is a leading shareholder in EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH), with 882,416 shares worth more than $8 million. Just like Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) is one of the best drone stocks to monitor. In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Alger, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) was among the top detractors from performance. EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) operates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) technology platform in China. It designs, develops, manufactures, sells and operates AAVs, as well as their supporting systems and infrastructure, for a range of industries and applications, including passenger transportation, logistics, smart city management and aerial media solutions. EHang is an opportunity to invest in the state-driven objective of China involving commercializing passenger-grade drone travel and EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) is by far the only AAV operator expected to receive a commercialization permit this year. Domestic rollouts of services starting in 2021 could potentially be a major inflection point in AAV adoption curve. Recently a short report came out attacking the integrity of EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) business practices and the stock has tumbled. Since then, EHang Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:EH) has provided evidence as part of rebutting the claims and an upcoming earnings call could potentially clear the remaining concerns.”9.

182,fd203b93-01a1-324a-88c2-5d72f28e8e78,BAX,2022-10-21,Analysts Estimate Baxter International (BAX) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-baxter-international-bax-140202586.html,1666274522,STORY,['BAX'],"[The market expects Baxter International (BAX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.77 billion, up 17% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.44% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter?For Baxter, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of -1.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Baxter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The high inflation and rising interest rate environment has caused consumer sentiment to slow down, and many companies are missing earnings estimates. However, some of the classic recession-proof stocks have recently performed strongly in the third quarter. Let's dive in to two of my favorites:Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).PG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PGPeter Lynch Chart of PG1. Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip consumer packaged goods company that produces a variety of household products. These include everything from shampoo to shaving products, laundry detergent and even toilet paper. This is truly a recession-proof stock as whether the economic situation is good or bad, people will need to buy these items.During the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, there was even a huge surge in the number of people buying and hoarding toilet paper out of fear that it may run out.The company operates in over 70 countries globally and has a strong market share in many of them.Strong earnings Procter &amp; Gamble recently announced strong financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2023. Revenue was a staggering $20.6 billion, which increased by 7% year over year and beat analyst estimates of 5.5% growth (according to Capital IQ data). This growth was mainly driven by price increases for its products and a favorable product sales mix, despite a 3% decline in overall organic sales volume. The company did experience a 6% headwind against revenue from the strong dollar, but this is excluded from the revenue data stated previously.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsThe company generated strong earnings per share of $1.57, which popped by almost 30% sequentially and beat analyst expectations by 1.3%. Procter &amp; Gamble also generated a solid operating margin of 24%, which increased by 30 basis points year over year. Procter &amp; Gamble increased its operational efficiency in the first quarter, which contributed to over 2.3% in margin improvement.Story continuesThe company has $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet compared to long term debt of $36.6 billion, but this is not a surprise or major issue for such a mature company with consistent cash flow.Procter &amp; Gamble pays a forward dividend yield of 2.82%, which has grown consistently for over 66 years.ValuationProcter &amp; Gamble has a price-earnings ratio of 22, which is 4% cheaper than its five-year average. The price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is 17, which is 9% cheaper than its five-year average.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsThe GF Value chart indicates a fair value of $150 per share, thus the stock is modestly undervalued at the time of writing.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten Earnings2. Johnson &amp; JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a blue chip health care products company which operates across four main segments: Consumer Health, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals and Vision. Its Consumer Health segment includes a variety of popular brands such as Tylenol, Neutrogena, Aveeno and more. Its Pharmaceuticals division includes cardiovascular disease treatments and even a Covid-19 vaccine.Strong earnings Johnson &amp; Johnson generated strong financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Revenue was $23.79 billion, which beat analyst consensus estimates by $357.6 million. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, global revenue increased by 8.2% year over year. This was driven primarily by the pharmaceutical segment, which generated $13.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% operationally. The second largest segment was Medical Devices, which generated $6.8 billion in sales, up 8.1% operationally year over year.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Medtronic has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Medtronic peKeen to find out how analysts think Medtronic's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Medtronic's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 35% last year. As a result, it also grew EPS by 19% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.5% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.3% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that Medtronic's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Medtronic's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Medtronic's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9%.Revenues are expected to be $3.53 billion, up 20.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.12% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Republic Services?For Republic Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.74%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Republic Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Republic Services would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of +11.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Republic Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsWaste Management (WM), another stock in the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.50 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +19.1%.

However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.51%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

200,47997dad-7c7b-323f-bb9b-df3d6567f779,MRK,2022-10-21,15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-dow-companies-market-130005221.html,1666270805,STORY,"['^DJI', 'KO', 'HD', 'PG', 'DIS', 'CSCO', 'CVX', 'MRK', 'MCD', 'JPM']","[In this article, we will take a look at 15 of the biggest Dow companies by market cap. If you want to see more of the biggest Dow companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, is one of the oldest indexes in the world. Having been founded in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index is easily one of the most followed indexes in the world.Originally the The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprised of only 12 companies, mainly with operations in oil and gas, sugar, tobacco and railroads. As the U.S. economy evolved, however, so did the Dow index. Now the index includes 30 companies, with companies operating in many different sectors including technology. As it did before, the companies listed on the Dow today are among the leaders in their core fields.Given that it only includes 30 large capitalization U.S. companies, the Dow index arguably doesn't reflect the U.S. economy as well as another popular index, the S&amp;P 500, which includes 500 U.S. companies. Furthermore, since the Dow index is a price weighted index, stocks with higher stock prices have more influence on the index regardless of their market cap. Price weighted indexes are also affected by stock splits while market cap weighted indexes are not.While it has its limitations, The Dow Jones Industrial Average has nevertheless done well with the index rising from 40.45 on January 1, 1897 to 30,423.81 on 10/19/22.Given economic cycles, Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced bull and bear markets over the years.According to Guggenheim, the Dow Jones has experienced four secular bear markets in its history before this year. Each of the four secular bear markets lasted for over 10 years and the average annualized returns over those years were near zero or slightly negative. Meanwhile, the Dow has experienced 5 secular bull markets, each of which have lasted from 5 years to 17 years in length. The average annualized returns of those bull markets have been 8.72% or higher.Story continuesGiven the stock market's performance in 2022, it seems we are in a bear market, although it isn't a secular bear market.Due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates substantially this year, the markets have declined substantially. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen almost 17% year to date and S&amp;P 500 has fallen nearly 23% year to date.With inflation remaining high, it seems the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates even more. With the rate hikes and increasing probability of a recession in 2023, the markets could decline further if economic data doesn't meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of quality stocks across many different sectors. In the Dow Jones index, here are some leading stocks:MethodologyFor the 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap, we took the 15 largest stocks listed on the The Dow Jones Industrial Average by market capitalization as of 10/19 according to FINVIZ.com and we ranked them #15 to #1.15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap15.

(NYSE:HD) is a leading retailer with a market capitalization of almost $290 billion that has been affected by the rising interest rates. Given that interest rates have increased, mortgage rates have surged since the beginning of the year, and demand for new housing is lower. With lower housing demand, demand for The Home Depot, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR). These, among other best momentum stocks, are discussed further in the article below.Story continuesImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the best momentum stocks to invest in, we screened for stocks that are up at least 30% for the year, as of October 20, and are expected to maintain this uptrend as we move into 2023.

Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7.

If you want to read about some more counter cyclical stocks, go directly to 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.The United States economy is hurtling towards a recession as a hawkish Federal Reserve continues to stomp down on inflation with aggressive rate hikes. In this macro environment, the benchmark indexes of the stock market, like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are all trading at new lows as investors take money out of stocks and pile into more value-friendly assets. The three indexes are down an alarming 22%, 32%, and 16% year-to-date as of October 20, respectively. In this macro environment, investors with growth-heavy portfolios are eagerly seeking out stocks which perform well during economic downturns and slowdowns. These counter cyclical stocks, unlike cyclical options like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), tend to perform well during recessions. For example, during a recession, sales of alcoholic beverages and fast food items increase as people seek to ward off depression and anxiety amid job cuts and inflation. Similarly, there is a general bias in favor of auto part firms during slowdowns as people are more likely to buy used cars or repair existing vehicles instead of buying new cars at inflated rates. Discount retailers also witness an uptick in activity during slowdowns. The sales of tobacco companies increase as well. Several top economists, including Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, have forecast a recession in the US in 2023, advising investors to prepare for the upcoming storm through investments in counter cyclical firms. Our MethodologyThe companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowImage by MayoFi from PixabayBest Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now10.

With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”9.

He stated that “doubling down” on climate policies by governments will make energy markets “more volatile, more unpredictable, more chaotic.”Wirth also mentioned that the premature push to transition from fossil fuels caused “unintended consequences”, including the energy supply insecurity from crisis-hit Europe to California.Despite substantial global investments in renewables in the last two decades, Wirth stated that fossil fuels account for about 80% of the global demand and that governments need to engage in honest conversations regarding the scale of energy woes.“The conversation [about energy] in the developed world for sure has skewed towards climate, taking affordability and security for granted,” Wirth said in an interview at the company’s headquarters in San Ramon, CA. “The reality is, [fossil fuel] is what runs the world today. It’s going to run the world tomorrow and five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now,” he said to Financial Times.The oil giant’s top executive’s comments come as western governments’ climate commitments contradict an energy crisis as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This has pushed up global inflation, with the possibility of a recession.Moreover, CVX anticipates that high European prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) will attract the majority of U.S. LNG exports in the short term. With Europe trying to find alternatives to Russian energy supplies, the demand for U.S. LNG has increased. The continent’s commitment to building import terminals and regasification facilities shows that the region's demand for U.S. exports could last.Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world with operations spanning worldwide.

Solid commercial deliveries, driven by improving domestic and international travel trends, must have boosted Boeing’s third-quarter earnings performance amid lower defense deliveries.Will Mixed Product Deliveries Aid Results?Boeing’s third-quarter deliveries reflected a solid 31.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure. However, defense shipments declined 2.7% year over year.For manufacturing companies like Boeing, successful deliveries of finished products play a crucial role in boosting revenue growth. Therefore, such a significant improvement witnessed in the jet maker’s deliveries for its commercial segment is expected to benefit Boeing’s overall third-quarter results.The Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteThe jet giant’s military business revenues comprised almost 43% of total revenues as of 2021-end, while that of the commercial business comprised 31%. The decline in defense shipment might have outweighed the revenue benefits of the solid commercial shipment, thereby hurting the overall Q3 top-line performance.Expectations for BGSAs far as Boeing Global Services (BGS) unit’s performance in the third quarter is concerned, we remain optimistic. Notably, a consistent recovery in domestic air travel and recent growth observed in international travel are expected to have bolstered fleet utilization, thereby once again boosting aftermarket commercial jet services in the third quarter of 2022. This, as well as strong cargo markets with several Boeing converted freighter and materials management agreements, must have added an impetus to BGS unit’s Q3 revenues.However, discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement since the second quarter, which might impact BA’s government service revenue profile, thereby partly impacting the overall performance of the BGS unit in Q3.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BGS unit revenues, pegged at $4,556 million, indicates an improvement of 7.9% from third-quarter 2021 reported revenues.The consensus mark for this segment’s earnings is pegged at $670 million, which indicates a solid improvement of 4% from third-quarter 2021 reported earnings.Cash Flow ProjectionsImproved air travel statistics in recent times, which resulted in higher 737 deliveries, along with higher order receipts as well as increased aftermarket services are likely to have contributed to Boeing’s cash flow reserve in the third quarter of 2022.Q3 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we remain optimistic about BA’s overall Q3 revenue and earnings performance. However, the abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program along with supply chain constraints might have had some adverse impact on the company’s bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s total revenues is pegged at $18.27 billion, suggesting a 19.6% improvement from the prior-year reported number. The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 9 cents per share, indicating an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 60 cents.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case for BA.Boeing has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

207,9d3457a5-1d59-35a4-afd8-f92dd9d1c668,BA,2022-10-21,Textron (TXT) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/textron-txt-earnings-expected-grow-140202441.html,1666274522,STORY,"['TXT', 'BA']","[The market expects Textron (TXT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, up 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron?For Textron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Textron would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Textron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Boeing (BA), is soon expected to post loss of $0.09 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +85%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $18.27 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Boeing has been revised 10.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boeing will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Supported by a 10 million Australian dollar (US $6.26 million) grant from the Australian Government, as well as contributions from Illumina and other organizations, the Australian Genetic Diversity Database project, called OurDNA, will gather data to improve disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment in underserved communities.Reference databases are essential to advance genomic medicine, providing deep information to understand genetic variations and their associations with disease. Unfortunately, true population genomics has been elusive.""Existing global databases are highly skewed towards people with European ancestry,"" says Professor Daniel MacArthur, who directs the CPG and leads the OurDNA initiative. ""This means Australians who are not of European descent may have difficulty being diagnosed for a genetic disease and may not benefit from ongoing advances in genomic medicine.""The OurDNA initiative will help remedy this deficit by involving people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, including Australians who have African, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, East African, Oceanian, Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander ancestry.The OurDNA team is prioritizing these groups based on their size, lack of representation in existing databases, and clinical need. The researchers will also work closely with the CONNECT Consortium, a national Indigenous-led effort that aims to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in genomic medicine and research.Overcoming longstanding barriersMinority communities in Australia have been underrepresented in genomic research for several reasons. In some cases, study organizations may have catered to majority populations because they are easier to contact through conventional communication channels.Story continuesResearchers have also not developed culturally aligned and language-appropriate participant information and education resources around genomics for many of Australia's diverse communities. As a result, it can be difficult for researchers to communicate a project's goals and benefits.""A major focus of this initiative is consulting extensively with communities prior to recruitment,"" MacArthur says. ""We want to ensure that we fully understand and accommodate each community's needs in our program design as much as possible.""To increase participation, the project is adopting participatory approaches that have successfully diversified medical research in other countries. For instance, the team will work closely with stakeholders from each community to better understand their views and expectations, and collaborate with them to design communications. Following the co-design process, the program will reach out to potential participants through a series of community events and other channels. Individuals who consent to participate in the project will contribute to the development of genomic resources that are more representative of Australia's diversity, including a reference database of genetic variation designed to improve the diagnosis of patients affected by rare genetic diseases.Global partners come togetherThe CPG is working with academic and industry partners, including the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, and Australian Genomics, to engage diverse communities throughout the country using proven approaches.Google Cloud and Microsoft are supporting secure data storage, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is collaborating with the CPG to make the data available to maximize its impact for patients worldwide. Illumina will be supporting the generation of whole-genome sequencing data, which is critical for the impact of the project on disease diagnosis rates.""Illumina is providing discounted reagents and flow cells for the whole-genome sequencing that is so essential to this project,"" MacArthur says.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Southern could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Southern peKeen to find out how analysts think Southern's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Southern's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Southern's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 4.2% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 33% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 14% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.3% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Southern is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Southern's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Southern   you should know about.If you're unsure about the strength of Southern's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

212,9ad8f879-beea-304d-9b25-12944ac2de98,SO,2022-10-21,Southern Co. (SO) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-co-earnings-expected-grow-140202099.html,1666274522,STORY,"['SO', 'FE']","[The market expects Southern Co. (SO) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.7 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.61% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southern Co.For Southern Co.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Southern Co. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southern Co. Would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.07, delivering a surprise of +27.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southern Co. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsFirstEnergy (FE), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.19 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for FirstEnergy has been revised 6% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.45%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that FirstEnergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAA — commonly known as MAA — is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26 after market close. MAA’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.The Germantown, TN-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.00% in terms of FFO per share in the last reported quarter. This residential REIT’s quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 2.32%. This is depicted in the chart below:MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. Rather, the pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture the recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. In the third quarter, MAA is expected to have experienced strong rent growth and stable occupancy, thereby driving revenue growth.MAA also continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $506.2 million, suggesting an 11.8% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Same-store revenues are projected at $486.95 million, indicating an increase from the $472.16 million reported in the prior quarter and $434.0 million in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for physical occupancy is presently pegged at 96.2% for the third quarter, up from 95.7% in the prior quarter.The consensus estimate for the third-quarter same-store net operating income is currently pegged at $308.08 million, up from $300.24 in the prior quarter and $269.39 in the year-ago period.MAA projected the third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share in the band of $1.99-$2.15, with $2.07 at the midpoint.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised three cents upward to $2.09 in the past three months. This also suggests year-over-year growth of 17.4%.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.31%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are two other stocks from the residential REIT sector — UDR Inc. UDR and Essex Property Trust, Inc. ESS — that you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.UDR, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

If you want to read about some more health insurance stocks, go directly to Top 5 Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.The health insurance industry has rapidly evolved over the past few years as insurer participation, pricing, and advanced plans drive innovation within the sector. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, 55 new insurers entered the market in 2022, representing a 21% increase over the past year, and marking the highest growth in participation in the industry since 2015, when participation had grown by around 26%. Over the past four years, product offerings have also increased, nearly tripling with half of that growth happening between 2021 and 2022. Tech-enabled insurance plans have contributed most to these growth numbers, per data gathered by the consulting firm, led by firms like Oscar and Bright Health. Some of the other prominent names in the insurance sector that have growth catalysts include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). Another interesting trend in the sector is the participation of exclusive provider organization plans. These have quadrupled to 36% as a share of all plan type offerings. Total health expenditure is expected to continue on an upward trend across the globe for the next five years. This growth is closely correlated with industry revenues in the health insurance world. However, McKinsey has cautioned that macro uncertainty will persist in part because the enhanced premium subsidies created by the American Rescue Plan Act are due to expire at the end of 2022. If these subsidies are not renewed, pricing and consumer participation may face headwinds in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the health insurance sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesTop 10 Health Insurance Stocks to BuyIakov Filimonov/Shutterstock.comTop Health Insurance Stocks to Buy10. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15  Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) provides financial products and services internationally. It is one of the best insurance stocks to invest in. On October 12, Barclays analyst John Aiken maintained an Overweight rating on Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) stock lowered the price to C$29 from C$30, noting that the continued decline in equity valuations driven by lower asset levels within the wealth operations and seed losses will likely dampen earnings growth in the quarter.  At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 15 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $155 million in Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), compared to 19 in the preceding quarter worth $517.5 million. Just like Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) is one of the best insurance stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Harding Loenver, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC), the Canadian life insurer operating primarily in North America and Asia, is a new holding. Manulife offers a full suite of life insurance products as well as retirement and wealth management services. While the wealth management and retirement products appeal to the aging populations of the Western world, long-term life insurance products address the needs of the growing number of middle-class families in places like China and southeast Asia. COVID-19-induced lockdowns in China brought the shares down to a significant discount to our estimate of long-term value. The holding now serves as a nice diversifier to our Asia-centered insurers AIA and Ping An.”9. Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ:CLOV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11     Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ:CLOV) operates as a medicare advantage insurer in the United States.

American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14     American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) provides insurance products in the United States. It is one of the major insurance stocks to invest in. On January 7, Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance said it has purchased an additional 6,755,000 shares of common stock of American Equity Investment Life Holding Company, bringing its total combined equity interest in AEL to nearly 16%. On October 7, Piper Sandler analyst John Barnidge maintained an Overweight rating on American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) stock and raised the price target to $47 from $46. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 14 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $103 million in American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL), compared to 17 in the previous quarter worth $155.7 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Pacific Adivsors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL), a leading writer of fixed index annuities, has continued to transition to its American Equity Investment (AEL) 2.0 business model. The plan’s main goals are to diversify the company’s assets into a broader array of investments, including private debt through strategic partnerships, and to increase its use of reinsurance to free up capital. We think this is an interesting, but somewhat aggressive plan. Thus far, the results have been impressive, but we continue to monitor the credit quality of their assets as they move toward achieving their target of having 40% of their portfolio invested in private assets, up from 15.4%.”7.

According to a report by professional services firm PwC, some of the other reasons for the changes in the sector include changes to risk profiles because of the climate crisis, distribution needs becoming omni-channel, and customers who expect products tailored just for them. Some of the top insurance stocks to monitor in this context include Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET). These firms are working on areas such as digitization, data and integration, brand and distribution, innovative products, strategic partnerships, and effective structuring to stay ahead of the competition. As the industry involves, per PwC, a focus on discipline is helping private equity, asset managers, and other new entrants to capitalize on the disruption. Consulting firm EY contends that ecosystems, open insurance, workforce transformation, and sustainability are set to define near-term prospects for the insurance industry. However, labor shortages and changes in the delivery of care and cybersecurity threats are likely to force health insurance towards embracing new approaches to risk management. Some of these new approaches include the digitization of core processes, migrations to the cloud, and the embrace of flexible sourcing models.Research firm Deloitte has identified rising inflation, interest rates, loss costs, the threats of recession, climate change, and geopolitical upheaval as some of the headwinds for the insurance sector in the coming months. The firm claims that the transformation in the life insurance industry is key to sustainable growth for the sector, as insurance firms double down on their pandemic-spurred digital enhancements, introduce new products, services, and distribution options, and seek out previously underserved customer niches.Story continuesOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the insurance sector and are trading at a discount compared to peers were selected for the list.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.8%.Revenues are expected to be $9.15 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.34% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northrop Grumman?For Northrop Grumman, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northrop Grumman will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northrop Grumman would post earnings of $6.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.06, delivering a surprise of +0.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northrop Grumman doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerGeneral Dynamics (GD), another stock in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.16 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +2.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $9.92 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for General Dynamics has been revised 0.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.61%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

218,d2a97618-551c-3098-afc2-25b73ed123ba,NKE,2022-10-21,Nike’s Venture into Web3 Isn’t About Tech – It’s About Culture,CoinDesk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-venture-web3-isn-t-151309751.html,1666278789,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike is making waves in Web3 and the metaverse.In November 2021, the athleisure icon unveiled a virtual experience in the online gaming platform Roblox. Since then the space – dubbed Nikeland – has attracted 6.7 million global visitors and over 21.6 million total visits. It’s not quite Vans’ 82 million visits, but Nike CEO John Donahue deemed the campaign successful enough to extend “the positive momentum and energy'' as part of the company’s digital strategy.Jake Stott is the co-founder and CEO of Hype, a Web3 agency.In December 2021, The Swoosh took a deep dive into Web3, acquiring non-fungible token (NFT) studio RTFKT. On the back of its new purchase, Nike launched a series of NFT drops in the following months, starting with its Cryptokicks – a collection of 20,000 sneaker NFTs, including one designed by artist Takashi Murakami that sold for an eye-watering $134,000. The company has since also toyed around with exclusive drops for NFT holders and other phygital (physical plus digital) items.By the numbersNike’s Web3 play has paid off – big time.Data shows The Swoosh has raked in almost $185 million in NFT sales revenue, lording over names including Adidas, Gucci, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Tiffany &amp; Co., which have collectively generated less than half of that revenue.But this all comes with a massive asterisk.Nike hasn’t disclosed the terms of the RTFKT acquisition, and its latest earnings call hasn’t offered any clarity into the operational costs of its Web3 venture. It’s impossible to say how much of a financial success – or failure – these campaigns have been. For reference, Nike’s projected annual revenue for 2022 is $46.7 billion.See also: Can Starbucks Bring Web3 Into the Mainstream? | OpinionOne thing is for sure, though: Nike has quickly clinched a spot as one of the most beloved brands in the nascent Web3 space.The numbers don’t lie, either. RTFKT’s Discord server currently boasts just under 232,000 members. By contrast, Adidas sits at almost 57,000 at the time of writing. Web3 natives like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club (both owned by Yuga Labs) are also trailing behind, with 71,000 and 172,000, respectively.Story continuesFor the cultureCrypto Twitter has praised Nike for its community-building savvy. But more than a successful case study in community building, Nike’s Web3 move is a perfect example of tapping into emerging cultures to reach new audiences and get ahead of the competition.Culture has been at the core of Nike’s strategy throughout the years. Branching out from sports performance, the brand has secured its status as a cultural icon in sports, music, lifestyle and art. It’s no surprise it’s taking the same approach in the budding Web3 and metaverse spaces.In an earnings call in 2019, Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings dropped a poignant one-liner: “We compete (and lose to) Fortnite [an online video game] more than HBO,” he said. “I think of it as us winning time away – entertainment time – from other activities.”See also: Reversibility on Ethereum: The Benefits and Pitfalls | OpinionThe race, in Hastings’ view, wasn’t the so-called streaming wars. As strong as Disney’s catalog was, he understood the real battle was for people’s attention – a big chunk of which was going to YouTube and gaming behemoths like Fortnite.It seems Nike has had a similar realization about Web3 and the metaverse. The Swoosh isn’t simply in a sales contest with Adidas, Under Armour and other apparel giants. It’s fighting for cultural relevance with challenger esports brands and upcoming digital fashion houses, many of which are gaining momentum with Gen Z and gaming circles.Although still far from Fortnite-tier mainstream penetration, digital fashion brands and gaming orgs have carved out a niche for themselves in internet culture and the digital economy, hawking skins, wearables and collectibles. Capitalizing on their mainstream popularity, some have even expanded into physical merchandise. The same is true for Web3 favorite Yuga Labs, which was recently valued at $4 billion.FaZe Clan expected revenue of $50 million in 2021. This pales in comparison with Nike’s $12.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023 – and the sports giant wants to keep it this way.By the time Netflix realized it was in a race with Fortnite, the contest had already heated up out of its control. The Swoosh doesn’t seem too keen on making the same mistake. Instead, Nike has embedded itself into the fabric of Web3 culture before the competition has even taken off.That’s the brilliance of its Web3 play. Unlike other traditional brands looking at Web3 as a new technology, Nike has figured out that technology is only one facet of something much bigger: a new cultural movement.]"

Arguably the biggest risk investors face with Tootsie Roll is that the Gordon family, which has run the company for decades, holds a controlling interest in it. Matriarch Ellen Gordon is CEO, and the family's majority voting stake means they will essentially decide which way the candy maker goes.Continue reading]"

Corporation VFC is likely to register top and bottom-line decreases from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s respective figures when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Oct 26, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $3,102 million, indicating a 3% dip from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at 74 cents per share, suggesting a 33.3% decline from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. Earnings estimates have moved 25.3% south in the past 30 days.We note that V.F. Corp delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.1% in the trailing four quarters, on average.Key Factors to NoteOn Sep 28, V.F. Corp issued guidance for the fiscal quarter under review. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, management projected revenue growth in a low-single digit in constant dollars and adjusted earnings of 70-75 cents, indicating a fall from $1.11 delivered in the year-earlier fiscal quarter. Management stated that the ongoing uncertainty, weaker-than-anticipated back-to-school performance at Vans and higher inventory causing increased promotions in North America were concerns.Moreover, VFC witnesses persistent sluggishness in the APAC region, particularly in China, due to drab traffic stemming from COVID-related lockdowns, local regulations, travel restrictions and consumer anxiety. Also, elevated SG&amp;A costs and rising freight expenses related to supply-chain disruptions remain headwinds. Continued congestion and disruption from labor shortages and equipment constraints across the logistics network are expected to have hurt the bottom line.On the positive front, V.F. Corp has been seeing strength across its brands for a while. In addition, both EMEA and North America regions are performing well. VFC is benefiting from Supreme’s strong follower base among the younger generation. These tailwinds might have aided the quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for V.F. Corp this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here as elaborated below.

BJ is likely to register top-line growth from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.

The overall loan demand was impressive in the to-be-reported quarter. Specifically, growth in commercial &amp; industrial loans (which constitute a large part of Zions’ loan portfolio) was decent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s average interest-earning assets for the third quarter is pegged at $83.7 billion, which indicates a rise of almost 1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Supported by the rise in loan balances and higher interest rates (the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 150 basis points in the quarter), Zions’ net interest income (NII), which is its main revenue component, and net interest margin (NIM) are expected to have improved. The consensus estimate for NII of $656 million indicates a year-over-year rise of 18.2%. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $653.2 million, reflecting an increase of 17.7%.Other Major Factors and Estimates for Q3Fee Revenues: Rising mortgage rates (that crossed the 6% mark in September) weighed on mortgage originations and refinancing activities in the third quarter. Thus, due to the not-so-impressive mortgage-banking business performance, Zions’ loan sales and servicing income are likely to have been adversely impacted in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $20.45 million, suggesting a 24.3% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.The consensus estimate for commercial account fees of $37 million implies a year-over-year rise of 8.8%. Similarly, the consensus estimate for card fees of $25.53 million indicates a rise of 2.1% from the previous year.The consensus estimate for retail and business banking fees is pegged at $16.23 million, suggesting an 18.9% year-over-year decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for wealth management fees of $12.81 million indicates a fall of 1.5%.Increased volatility across the markets and products seems to have supported Zions’ capital markets and foreign exchange fees. The estimate the same is $18.92 million, which suggests a year-over-year rise of 11.3%.Hence, due to the expected fall in almost all components, the customer-related fee (accounting for more than 85% of Zions’ total non-interest income) is anticipated to have decreased in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $146 million, which indicates a decline of 3.3%. We project this metric to decrease 12.1% to $132.1 million.The consensus estimate for dividends and other income is pegged at $5.99 million, indicating a decline of 33.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-interest income is pegged at $151 million, suggesting a rise of 8.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric stands at $144.8 million, reflecting a rise of 4.2%.Expenses: Zions has been witnessing a persistent rise in operating expenses over the past few years. The company continues to invest in franchise, which along with inflationary pressure, is expected to have kept operating expenses elevated in the third quarter.Our estimate for total non-interest expenses is pegged at $467.9 million, reflecting a 9.1% increase from the prior-year quarter number.Asset Quality: With the rise in loan balance and expectations of economic slowdown due to geopolitical and inflation concerns, ZION is expected to have built reserves in the third quarter. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $18.8 million against a provision benefit of $46 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-performing loans is pegged at $288 million, suggesting a decline of 10.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Further, the consensus estimate for total non-performing assets of $288 million indicates an 11.1% fall.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is +0.97%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Zions Bancorporation, N.A.

Our estimate for earnings is also $1.58 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $813 million, which indicates a rise of 16% from the prior-year reported figure.

This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right.

Last night, three Native CDFIs - Akiptan, Haa Yakaawu, and Nimiipuu Fund - were honored by Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), Oweesta Corporation, and Wells Fargo with the 2022 Native CDFI Awards.""Native CDFIs open avenues for economic opportunity through innovative financial products, advanced capacity building efforts, and deep relationships with their respective tribal communities,"" said Chrystel Cornelius, president and CEO of Oweesta Corporation. ""It is an honor to recognize these native CDFIs who are reaching deep into their communities to finance change.""Launched in 2019, the national Native CDFI Awards recognize Native CDFIs for creating economic opportunity and promoting wealth building within their tribal communities.""Native-led CDFIs make Indian Country stronger,"" said Dawson Her Many Horses, senior vice president and head of Native American Banking at Wells Fargo. ""We are proud to recognize Akiptan, Haa Yakaawu, and Nimiipuu Fund for their tireless efforts to reduce inequities by deploying financial products that support housing, small business, food production, and more.""The AwardeesThis year, two Native CDFIs are recognized with Catalyst Awards, which support compelling strategies to help tribal communities overcome barriers to economic development and access to capital. The Catalyst Awards come with a $150,000 grant.Akiptan, Inc. is a certified Native CDFI whose mission is to connect Native agricultural producers with capital and other resources they need to succeed. Based in Eagle Butte, South Dakota on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, Akiptan will use the grant award to increase staff and develop new financial literacy tools for agricultural producers, as well as design a youth-focused financial literacy learning game.Story continues""Receiving the Native CDFI Catalyst Award is incredibly exciting and humbling,"" said Akiptan Executive Director Skya Ducheneaux.

In 2023, the market is expected to move to private insurance after the U.S. public health emergency expires.""We are confident that the U.S. price point of the COVID-19 vaccine reflects its overall cost effectiveness and ensures the price will not be a barrier for access for patients,"" Lukin said.It is not yet clear what kind of access people without health insurance will have to the vaccine.Pfizer said it expects the COVID-19 market to be about the size of the flu shot market on an annual basis for adults, but that the pediatric market would take longer to build based on shots given so far.So far the U.S. rollout of updated COVID-19 booster shots which target both the original coronavirus strain and the Omicron strain has lagged last year's rate despite more people being eligible for the shots.Around 14.8 million people in the U.S. received a booster shot over the first six weeks of the rollout of the new shots.

The dose will be administered to individuals 12 years of age and older.This bivalent vaccine combines 25-µg Spikevax (mRNA-1273), Moderna’s currently marketed COVID vaccine, and 25-µg of another vaccine candidate targeting the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.The CHMP recommendation is supported by data based on preclinical studies conducted on mRNA-1273.222 and data from the phase II/III study, which evaluated mRNA-1273.214, another bivalent candidate developed by Moderna to target the Omicron BA.1 subvariant. mRNA-1273.214 was authorized by European Commission (“EC”) last month for individuals aged 12 years and above.An ongoing phase II/III study is evaluating mRNA-1273.222.

Pfizer/BioNTech received authorization for two bivalent vaccines targeting the Omicron variant. While Pfizer/BioNTech initially received authorization for its BA.1 Omicron-targeting bivalent vaccine on the same day as mRNA-1273.214, the EC authorized their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in adults and adolescents on Sep 12, 2022.Currently, the bivalent BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-targeting COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are authorized for use in the United States. While Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine is authorized for use in individuals aged five years and older, Moderna’s bivalent vaccines can be administered to individuals aged six years and above.Story continuesIn a separate press release, Moderna also announced that the CHMP recommended 25-µg two-dose series of Spikevax for use in individuals aged six months to five years of age. The CHMP has also recommended expanding the use of Pfizer/BioNTech’s Comirnaty for use in individuals aged between six months and four years of age.

The EUA allows the vaccine to be administered to adults who are not suited to receiving an mRNA-based bivalent developed by Moderna MRNA and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX or those adults who want to be administered with Novavax’s COVID vaccine.Novavax’s COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, has also been endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) for use as a booster dose in adults.Novavax’s protein-based vaccine has been granted EUA as a primary regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older as a two-dose primary regimen. Nevertheless, most of the U.S. population has already been inoculated with a primary regimen of either Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID vaccine.The latest label expansion will enable Novavax to target a larger segment of the adult population who have already completed a primary vaccination series but are yet to receive a booster dose. Per CDC estimates, nearly 50% of the adult population in the United States has yet to receive their first booster dose.The FDA decision and CDC endorsement are based on data from the late-stage PREVENT-19 study and mid-stage COV-BOOST study conducted in the United States and the U.K., respectively. Data from these studies showed that a booster dose of the vaccine generated increased immune responses by 34- to 27-fold compared with the data observed in pre-boost levels. The vaccine also induced a robust antibody response when used as a heterologous booster dose.Shares of Novavax have plunged 87.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s 25.0% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast month, the European Commission (EC) expanded its conditional marketing authorization (CMA) for Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine to allow its use as a heterologous/homologous booster dose in adults aged 18 years and older in the European Union (EU).Following the EUA expansion to Novavax’s vaccine, share prices of Moderna and BioNTech were down by almost 8% on Oct 19. The EUA expansion to Novavax’s vaccine gives the U.S. population more options as to which booster vaccine they would like to get administered. Unlike Pfizer, which already has a portfolio of marketed drugs and therapies, Moderna and BioNTech are entirely dependent on COVID vaccine sales for revenues that are likely to decline in the next year as the impact of the pandemic recedes rapidly.Novavax, Inc.

(Nasdaq: ERAS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, today announced a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement (CTCSA) with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) for the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (IBRANCE®).This agreement will support a clinical proof-of-concept study evaluating ERAS-007, an oral ERK1/2 inhibitor, in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of patients with KRAS- and NRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) and KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The combination is currently being investigated as part of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 HERKULES-3 master protocol clinical trial in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Erasca is sponsoring the study, and Pfizer is supplying palbociclib at no cost.“We are excited to expand our existing relationship with Pfizer to explore ERAS-007 in combination with palbociclib in RAS-mutated GI malignancies as part of our HERKULES-3 program,” said Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., Erasca’s chairman, CEO, and co-founder. “Preclinical evidence supports synergistic anti-tumor effects when downstream RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition is combined with cell cycle inhibition in CRC and PDAC. ERAS-007 blocks RAS/MAPK pathway signaling at the terminal node with robust inhibitory activity across RAS mutations, while data support palbociclib inhibition of CDK4/6 leading to cell cycle arrest. Based on their respective mechanisms of action, ERAS-007 and palbociclib offer a promising combination to overcome adaptive resistance in patients with these highly prevalent oncogenic drivers.”Story continuesWorldwide, approximately 1.8 million cases of CRC are diagnosed annually, with about 50% of patients harboring KRAS or NRAS mutations. PDAC accounts for an estimated 0.5 million new cases diagnosed annually, with over 90% harboring a KRAS mutation. Lack of effective treatment availability and emergence of compensatory mechanisms of resistance continue to challenge the ability to achieve and maintain responses in these GI malignancies. Erasca is exploring whether inhibiting ERK1/2, the terminal node of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, in combination with palbociclib can limit the development of treatment resistance and further improve therapeutic benefits. About ERAS-007ERAS-007 is a potential best-in-class ERK1/2 inhibitor being investigated alone or in combination with different inhibitors targeting upstream nodes of the RAS/MAPK pathway as part of Erasca’s MAPKlamp strategy. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), ERK1 and ERK2, belong to a family of serine-threonine kinases that regulate cellular signaling and comprise the terminal node of the RAS/MAPK pathway. ERAS-007 is being investigated across a series of HERKULES clinical trials that span multiple tumor types and include both monotherapy and combinations with approved and investigational agents, such as RTK, SHP2, RAS, RAF, and/or cell cycle inhibitors. HERKULES-1 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for ERAS-007 as a single agent and in combination with the SHP2 inhibitor ERAS-601 (together, Erasca’s first MAPKlamp) in advanced solid tumors. HERKULES-2 is a Phase 1b/2 master protocol clinical trial for ERAS-007 in combination with various agents in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HERKULES-3 is a Phase 1b/2 master protocol clinical trial for ERAS-007 in combination with various agents in patients with GI cancers.About ErascaAt Erasca, our name is our mission: To erase cancer.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $52.88 indicates a potential upside of 35.2%.The average comprises 16 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $33 to a high of $76, with a standard deviation of $14.22. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 15.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 94.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in UAL. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for UALHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why UAL Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 48.2% over the past month, as four estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, UAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much UAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and United Airlines (UAL) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 8.3% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 7.4% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.24. This indicates that the stock moves 24% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UAL has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UAL is currently trading at 0.31 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 31 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to display year-over-year declines.This Wilmington, DE-based lender’s second-quarter 2022 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate primarily due to a fall in expenses, partially offset by declines in net interest income (“NII”) and non-interest income. A rise in provisions was another headwind.NAVI has a decent earnings surprise history. Navient’s earnings outpaced estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, missing the mark once. The negative earnings surprise was 27.1%.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNavient Corporation price-eps-surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteNAVI’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 78 cents has moved marginally upward in the past month. The figure indicates a 12.4% plunge from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Key Factors to NotePer the Fed’s latest data, while there was consumer loan growth, the pace of increase decelerated in the third quarter. Also, the government announced its debt relief program and extended payment moratoriums through December 2022. The moratorium extension has created uncertainty in origination volumes and lowered the demand for refinance loans for student lenders like NAVI. This is expected to have affected the company’s NII in the third quarter.The consensus estimate for NII for the third quarter is pegged at $291.9 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline 2.4%.The increasing interest rate environment (a 150-basis-point increase in the third quarter) is anticipated to have affected its net interest margin in the Federal Education Loans and Consumer Lending segments.Weakness in fee income is expected to have kept Navient’s top line under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. The pandemic-related contract expirations are expected to have continued to affect revenues in the Business Processing segment.Story continuesThe consensus estimate for servicing revenues is pegged at $17 million, unchanged from the prior quarter’s reported figure. Also, the consensus mark for asset recovery and business processing revenues suggests a sequential fall of 6.8% to $82 million.With this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $104 million for total fee income indicates a decline of 22.4% from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Navient’s initiatives to become a technologically-advanced company and its aim to expand services outside the education industry are expected to have led to elevated expenses, affecting bottom-line growth.Nonetheless, NAVI earlier announced plans to repurchase $400 million of its common stock in the ongoing year. As of the second-quarter end, the company had $180 million of its targeted amount remaining to be repurchased through 2022 end. Hence, we expect the company to have continued its repurchase activities in the quarter under review.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Navient this time around.

This compares to earnings of $0.43 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.12%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this freight railroad would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of 6.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.CSX , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, posted revenues of $3.9 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.29 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.CSX shares have lost about 25.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for CSX?While CSX has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CSX: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.50 on $3.77 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.88 on $14.75 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Rail is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

While reflected as a pre-tax adjusted item, the net provision benefit is not included in a non-GAAP reconciliation as it is not a non-GAAP metric and was not used in the determination of any non-GAAP metrics.**** The third quarter of 2022 CECL provision (in excess of) less than net charge-offs excludes the $31 million net provision benefit from the sale of unsecured consumer loans and the $20 million provision for hurricane-related allowance for loan losses.***** Interest income for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans includes estimated funding costs.Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) impacting the company's earnings are identified to assist investors in analyzing Regions' operating results on the same basis as that applied by management and provide a basis to predict future performance. Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) in the current quarter include $179 million in professional, legal and regulatory fees associated with a third quarter settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding one type of overdraft fee the company discontinued in 2021. The amount adjusted this quarter is less than the previously announced $191 million settlement as approximately $12 million was accrued by the company in the second quarter. The settlement is expected to be partially mitigated by a $50 million insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter.

Net interest income grew 14 percent compared to the second quarter driven primarily by higher interest rates, continued strong average loan growth and lower than anticipated deposit costs. Lower cash balances also helped support the net interest margin, which increased 47 basis points to 3.53 percent. Excluding the impact of PPP interest income and excess cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, the company's adjusted net interest margin(1) was 3.68 percent.Non-interest income decreased 5 percent on both a reported and an adjusted basis(1) compared to the second quarter of 2022. Capital markets income decreased 17 percent. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, capital markets income decreased $20 million driven primarily by delayed advisory transactions attributable to continued market volatility. Mortgage income decreased 21 percent as higher interest rates led to lower production volumes partially offset by higher mortgage servicing income. Service charges income and card &amp; ATM fees both decreased 5 percent primarily due to the implementation of previously disclosed overdraft-related policy enhancements and decreased transaction volume in debit card. In addition to this year's policy changes, the company has routinely made enhancements to its overdraft processes that benefit customers such that total overdraft-related revenues were approximately 35% lower in 2021 versus 2011. However, this decline was offset by strategic growth and diversification of revenue through fee based services including mortgage, capital markets, wealth management and card and ATM fees. Despite volatile markets, wealth management income increased 6 percent compared to the prior quarter, while market value adjustments on employee benefit assets that are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense improved $12 million.Non-interest expenseQuarter Ended($ amounts in millions)9/30/20226/30/20229/30/20213Q22 vs. 2Q223Q22 vs. 3Q21Salaries and employee benefits$593$575$552$183.1%$417.4%Equipment and software expense98979011.0%88.9%Net occupancy expense76757511.3%11.3%Outside services40383825.3%25.3%Professional, legal and regulatory expenses1992421175NM178NMMarketing292223731.8%626.1%FDIC insurance assessments161311323.1%545.5%Credit/checkcard expenses131316——%(3)(18.8)%Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges3(6)—9150.0%3NMVisa class B shares expense394(6)(66.7)%(1)(25.0)%Loss on early extinguishment of debt——20——%(20)(100.0)%Other10088881213.6%1213.6%Total non-interest expense$1,170$948$938$22223.4%$23224.7%Total adjusted non-interest expense(1)$988$954$918$343.6%$707.6%NM - Not MeaningfulNon-interest expense increased 23 percent on a reported basis and 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the second quarter of 2022.

Salaries and benefits increased 3 percent driven primarily by higher base salaries as full-time equivalent headcount increased by 277 positions, as well as there being one additional work day in the quarter. Over 70 percent of the associate additions are customer facing within the company's three lines of business. Marketing expenses increased 32 percent due to the timing of marketing campaigns.The company's third quarter efficiency ratio was 62.3 percent on a reported basis and 52.6 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The effective tax rate was 23.7 percent compared to 21.2 percent in the second quarter. The increase in tax rate was attributable primarily to the nondeductible nature of a portion of the regulatory settlement.Loans and LeasesAverage Balances($ amounts in millions)3Q222Q223Q213Q22 vs. 2Q223Q22 vs. 3Q21Commercial and industrial$49,120$46,538$41,892$2,5825.5%$7,22817.3%Commercial real estate—owner-occupied5,4415,4775,682(36)(0.7)%(241)(4.2)%Investor real estate7,8797,4287,3114516.1%5687.8%Business Lending62,44059,44354,8852,9975.0%7,55513.8%Residential first mortgage18,12517,56917,1985563.2%9275.4%Home equity6,0506,0826,523(32)(0.5)%(473)(7.3)%Consumer credit card1,1761,1451,128312.7%484.3%Other consumer—exit portfolios7168361,363(120)(14.4)%(647)(47.5)%Other consumer6,1775,6892,2534888.6%3,924174.2%Consumer Lending32,24431,32128,4659232.9%3,77913.3%Total Loans$94,684$90,764$83,350$3,9204.3%$11,33413.6%NM - Not meaningfulAverage loans and leases increased 4 percent compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by growth in commercial and industrial lending.

Excluding charge-offs related to the unsecured consumer loan sale, net charge-offs would have been $47 million, or 19 basis points of average loans, which was in-line with expectations.Provision expense was $135 million this quarter. The increase compared to the second quarter was attributable primarily to strong loan and commitment growth, normalizing credit from historically low levels, and a $20 million reserve build for potential losses associated with Hurricane Ian. These increases were partially offset by a net provision benefit of $31 million associated with the unsecured consumer loan sale.The allowance for credit loss ratio is up 1 basis point to 1.63 percent of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans remains strong at 311 percent.

gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customers’ needs and respond to emerging technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue.Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could result in losing business to competitors.Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance

For discussion of these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, look under the captions ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors"" of Regions’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the ""Risk Factors"" of Regions' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC.Forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that the actual effects may differ, possibly materially, from what is reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the impact of additional variants and resurgences), the effectiveness, availability and acceptance of any vaccines or therapies, and the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, third parties and us.The words ""future,"" ""anticipates,"" ""assumes,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""seeks,"" ""believes,"" ""predicts,"" ""potential,"" ""objectives,"" ""estimates,"" ""expects,"" ""targets,"" ""projects,"" ""outlook,"" ""forecast,"" ""would,"" ""will,"" ""may,"" ""might,"" ""could,"" ""should,"" ""can,"" and similar terms and expressions often signify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Use of non-GAAP financial measuresManagement uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted fee income and adjusted efficiency ratios. Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:Preparation of Regions' operating budgetsMonthly financial performance reportingMonthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)Presentation to investors of company performanceMetrics for incentive compensationRegions’ Investor Relations contact is Dana Nolan at (205) 264-7040; Regions’ Media contact is Jeremy King at (205) 264-4551.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221021005049/en/ContactsMedia Contact: Jeremy King(205) 264-4551Investor Relations Contact: Dana Nolan(205) 264-7040]"
278,c76a7a83-88ef-349c-88b7-263cec74a1ed,V,2022-10-21,Visa (V) to Post Q4 Earnings: Here's What You Can Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-v-post-q4-earnings-162504866.html,1666283104,STORY,['V'],"[Visa Inc. V is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 financial results on Oct 25, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the payments technology company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.98 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.8%, primarily due to continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. However, elevated operating costs partly offset the upside.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.86 has witnessed no upward revisions but three downward movements in the past week. The estimate is indicative of a 14.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate of $1.83 per share indicates 13% year-over-year growth. Visa beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 8.8%. This is depicted in the graph below.Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.6 billion, suggesting a 15.1% jump from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate is $7.5 billion.Factors to NoteHigher travel and entertainment-related spending are expected to have driven Visa’s results in the fiscal fourth quarter. The adaption of digital payments is expected to have continued in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total volume, which consists of cash volume and payments volume (the primary lever of service revenues), is pegged at $3,676 billion, indicating an increase from $3,461 billion in the year-ago period. Our estimate indicates an 8.6% increase in the metric for the quarter under review.As the company draws revenues as a set percentage of total transaction value every time a customer makes payments with a debit/credit card, higher spending means more revenues in the form of transaction processing fees. Both the consensus mark and our estimate for total payments transactions indicate a 10% year-over-year increase.Story continuesThe consensus mark signals an 8.1% year-over-year increase in data processing revenues. We expect the metric to increase 6.8% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. With the growth in payments volume and processed transactions, Visa’s operating efficiency is expected to have improved in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. This is expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year bottom-line growth.However, rising expenses might have partially offset the positive impact of higher volumes, making an earnings beat uncertain. We expect total operating expenses for the quarter under review to increase 16.7% year over year due to increased Personnel, Network and Processing and Professional Fees expenses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Visa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. The Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.83 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Visa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Visa, here are some companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Shift4 Payments, Inc. FOUR has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shift4 Payments’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 53.9% year-over-year increase. FOUR beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with an average surprise of 4.2%.Marqeta, Inc. MQ has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marqeta’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable in the past week. MQ beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average of 21.8%.Riot Blockchain, Inc. RIOT has an Earnings ESP of +125.49% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Riot Blockchain’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 3 cents per share, which witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against one in the opposite direction.

279,4f657f59-a72b-3f7f-9546-77b31912ef8c,V,2022-10-21,Wex (WEX) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wex-wex-reports-next-week-140102585.html,1666274462,STORY,"['WEX', 'V']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Wex (WEX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of fuel payment processing for fleet vehicles is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +39.6%.Revenues are expected to be $589.64 million, up 22.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wex?For Wex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wex would post earnings of $3.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.71, delivering a surprise of +8.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerVisa (V), another stock in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.86 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +14.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $7.55 billion, up 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Visa has been revised 1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Visa will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The fact that insiders chose to dispose of US$13m worth of stock in the past 12 months even though prices were relatively low could be indicative of some anticipated weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$444. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's stake.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Lockheed Martin. In total, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Lockheed Martin Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$73m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Lockheed Martin makes money, and is growing profits. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin you should be aware of.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

This order includes spacecraft, mission planning and support, and takes us into the 2030s,"" said Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager for Commercial Civil Space, Lockheed Martin. ""We're on the eve of a historic launch kicking off the Artemis era and this contract shows NASA is making long-term plans toward living and working on the Moon, while also having a forward focus on getting humans to Mars.""This order marks the second three missions under the agency's Orion Production and Operations Contract (OPOC), an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for up to 12 vehicles. A breakout of these orders includes:2019: NASA initiates OPOC IDIQ and orders three Orion spacecraft for Artemis missions III-V.2022: NASA orders three additional Orion spacecraft missions for Artemis VI-VIII for $1.99 billion.In the future: NASA can order an additional six Orion missions.Under OPOC, Lockheed Martin and NASA have reduced the costs on Orion by 50% per vehicle on Artemis III through Artemis V, compared to vehicles built during the design and development phase. The vehicles built for Artemis VI, VII and VIII will see an additional 30% cost reduction.Story continues""We're achieving substantial cost savings from Artemis III through Artemis VIII by extensive structure and system reuse and incorporating advanced digital design and manufacturing processes,"" said Tonya Ladwig, Orion vice president and program manager at Lockheed Martin Space. ""The Artemis II vehicle will reuse select avionics from the Artemis I crew module, and that reuse will continue to dramatically increase to where the Artemis III pressure vessel capsule will be entirely refurbished for the Artemis VI mission.""Additionally, the company will drive out cost from these production vehicles through material and component bulk buys from suppliers and an accelerated mission cadence.With the Artemis I Orion spacecraft currently on top of the Space Launch System rocket, there are two other Orion vehicles undergoing assembly at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Artemis II and III. Work is well under way on the Artemis IV craft including welding the pressure vessel together at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans and the heat shield at Lockheed Martin's facility near Denver, and work has already begun on the Artemis V vehicle.More information about OrionLockheed Martin Orion page: https://www.lockheedmartin.com/orionNASA Orion page: https://www.nasa.gov/orionAbout Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

If you want to read about some more military drone stocks, check out 5 Best Military Drone Stocks to Invest In.Drone technology has exploded into the mainstream ever since the United States government granted exemptions to companies to operate drones in the fields of insurance, construction, and agriculture, expanding the scope of the drone tech outside the military space. The Federal Aviation Administration also helped devise a regulatory framework for commercial drones to help the market further. Since then, tech firms have been doing all they can to bring drone tech to as many businesses as possible.  However, even as the drone market expands, defense firms like Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) remain some of the biggest manufacturers of the unmanned air vehicles. According to data collected by Research and Markets, the drone services market size is expected to grow to more than $63 billion by 2025 as consumer drone shipments cross the 30 million mark in 2022. Even large investment advisors are bullish on the drone sector. Goldman Sachs forecasts the total drone market size will be worth $100 billion in the coming years on the back of the growing demand for drones from the commercial and government sectors. Similarly, Markets and Markets research shows that the drone sector will reach a value of over $58 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of more than 16% from 2021. The market for small drones is also expanding and will reach $22.55 billion in value by 2026. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the military drone sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Military Drone Stocks to Invest InPhotobank gallery/Shutterstock.comBest Military Drone Stocks To Invest In10.

As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 90 bps to 20.3% in the third quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $87.3 million in the quarter, which was flat year over year.Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $289.9 million, up 6.6% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 20 bps to 24.4%.SnapOn Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SnapOn Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSnapOn Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | SnapOn Incorporated QuoteStory continuesSegmental DetailsSales in Commercial &amp; Industrial Group rose 1.5% from the prior-year quarter to $356.8 million, driven by organic sales growth of 7.9%. This was partly offset by a negative currency impact of $20.8 million. Organic growth was aided by higher sales in the segment’s Asia Pacific operations and specialty tools business. Organic sales also benefited from sales growth in critical industries.The Tools Group segment’s sales rose 5.3% year over year to $496.6 million, driven by organic sales growth of 7.4%, offset by an $8.9-million negative impact of foreign currency. Robust sales in the U.S. franchise business aided organic sales, while declines in international operations have partly negated the results.Sales in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group advanced 13.6% year over year to $414 million, with organic sales growth of 17.2%. Sales gains were somewhat offset by an $11.2-million negative impact from foreign currency. Strong sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a rise in sales of under-car equipment contributed to segment organic sales growth. Increased activities with OEM dealerships also aided the segment’s results.The Financial Services business’ reported revenues dropped 23.9% year over year to $66.4 million in the quarter.FinancialsAs of Oct 1, 2022, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $759.3 million, with long-term debt of $1,183.6 million and shareholders’ equity (before non-controlling interest) of $4,317.2 million. It incurred $61.5 million of capital expenditure as of Oct 1, 2022.Looking AheadThough Snap-on has shown resilience, management expects the impacts of threats of new COVID-19 variants and supply-chain headwinds to persist throughout 2022. The company is progressing well with its growth efforts, focused on expanding its professional customer base, particularly in the automotive repair and critical industries. As a result, the capital expenditure for 2022 is projected to be $90-$100 million. It expects an effective tax rate of 23-24% for 2022.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Crocs Inc.

This compares to earnings of $3.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this tool and diagnostic equipment maker would post earnings of $3.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.27, delivering a surprise of 9.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Snap-On , which belongs to the Zacks Tools - Handheld industry, posted revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.04 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Snap-On shares have lost about 0.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for Snap-On?While Snap-On has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Snap-On: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.24 on $1.15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.14 on $4.45 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Tools - Handheld is currently in the bottom 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This maker of golf equipment and accessories is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.

Wireless service revenue growth and higher wireless equipment revenue more than offset wireline declines and the net impact of merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity in 2021.Total wireless service revenue growth of 10.0 percent year over year, primarily driven by the company's ownership of TracFone, continued effectiveness in its premium Unlimited strategy and ongoing strength in Business volumes.Verizon is focused on continuously improving operating efficiencies and mitigating inflation impacts, and has started a new cost savings program that is expected to provide a reduction in annual costs of between $2 billion and $3 billion by 2025.Net income of $5.0 billion, a decrease of 23.3 percent from third-quarter 2021, and adjusted EBITDA1 of $12.2 billion, a decline of 0.4 percent year over year.Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $28.2 billion, compared with $31.2 billion in 2021.

SWK is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 27, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stanley Black’s third-quarter earnings has been revised about 1.8% downward in the past 60 days. SWK delivered better-than-expected results thrice in the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the earnings surprise being 6.1%, on average.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Stanley Black this earnings season.Factors to NoteSWK’s Industrial segment’s performance is expected to have gained from the ongoing recovery in OEM production and pricing actions. Strong backlogs and healthy demand for aerospace fasteners also might have supported the segment’s growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for the segment’s revenues in the third quarter indicates a 7.4% rise from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same indicates an 8.8% rise from the year-ago figure.The company’s December 2021 acquisitions of Excel Industries and MTD Holdings, which have boosted its channel opportunities, strengthened innovation capabilities and enhanced product offerings so far, are expected to have contributed to top-line growth in the third quarter.However, weakness in its Tools &amp; Outdoor segment, owing to reduced retail and consumer demand, might have dented its third-quarter performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating profit indicates a 77.2% decrease from the year-ago figure.Also, supply-chain restrictions and increased raw material costs are expected to have adversely impacted margins and profitability in the third quarter. We expect SWK’s gross margin to deteriorate to 25.4% in the third quarter of 2022 from 32.1% reported in the year-ago period.The rising cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses might have dented SWK’s bottom line. Stanley Black’s overseas business are likely to have been affected by unfavorable movements in foreign currencies in third-quarter 2022.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Stanley Black this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: Stanley Black has an Earnings ESP of -3.45% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 70 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents.

QuoteZacks Rank: Stanley Black carries a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q2 EarningsStanley Black reported lackluster second-quarter 2022 results. SWK’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.5% and sales lagged the same by 7.9%.SWK’s second-quarter adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.12. The bottom line decreased 42.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3.08. Lower volume, supply-chain restrictions and cost inflation were the spoilsports. Stanley Black’s net sales totaled $4,393 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Sonoco Products Company SON has an Earnings ESP of +4.20% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. SON is slated to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 31.Sonoco’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 4.1%.Emerson Electric Co.

303,f4fa949d-9045-387f-8e03-bf888fc1710b,SWK,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-stanley-black-decker-140202815.html,1666274522,STORY,['SWK'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis tool company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -73.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.12 billion, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stanley Black &amp; Decker?For Stanley Black &amp; Decker, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Stanley Black &amp; Decker would post earnings of $2.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of -16.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Stanley Black &amp; Decker doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Europe’s Energy Crisis Takes a Surprise TurnBiren Technology develops artificial intelligence chips and is considered a promising domestic contender to compete with graphics chips from Nvidia Corp., which has said it can no longer sell its most advanced AI products into China. The US measures were designed to limit China’s development of technology that may be used in aid of its military, and appeared to rule out access to advanced fabrication, but Biren believes its AI chips produced by TSMC are not covered by the sanctions, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.Shanghai-based Biren, founded in 2019, made bold claims in the summer about its chips outperforming Nvidia’s market-leading A100 AI accelerator -- the very product that can no longer be sold in China. But after reviewing the designs, TSMC and Biren concluded that the specs of the Chinese chip don’t meet the criteria for restriction, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing a sensitive matter. That suggests Washington’s controls may not capture all alternatives to Nvidia’s hardware.“Biren has a chip fortunately just below the threshold and the chip hence can still be made by TSMC,” Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a report that analyzed chips against the export control.The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which plays a key role in designing and enforcing export controls, announced the semiconductor restrictions on Oct. 7.Story continues“While BIS cannot comment on company-specific actions, we expect all companies to comply with export controls,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in an emailed response to a Bloomberg query. “Since the release of the rule on October 7, BIS has been undertaking a vigorous outreach effort to educate those impacted by it to aid compliance efforts.”TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, complies with all relevant rules and regulations and “will continue to serve all customers around the world,” Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said in response to a question about China during its earnings call last week.Biren believes everything it’s doing is in compliance with legal regulations, according to one of the people. TSMC is reviewing products from other Chinese chip developers to see whether it can continue their production under the new export controls, another person said.Representatives for Biren and TSMC declined to comment.As the US banned exports of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s high-end AI-training chips to China, it set a performance threshold above which no semiconductors made with US technology can be sold in the country. The metrics include a combination of connectivity speeds and operations per second. Bernstein’s analysis shows the Biren BR100 falls just shy of that control cutoff.Bernstein’s Li saw limited revenue exposure for TSMC from the new controls, stressing that “only very high-end compute chips are restricted” and estimating a hit of 0.4% to the Taiwanese company’s 2023 sales.Still, while Biren may continue building its current generation of semiconductors, Washington’s curbs are likely to effectively cap its progress up the technology ladder. Additional improvements from Biren are liable to fall foul of the high-performance silicon restriction.Biren, backed by the likes of IDG Capital and Walden International, was seeking new funds earlier this year at a valuation of $2.7 billion, Bloomberg News reported. Its flagship BR100 and BR104 processors are designed along similar lines to the graphics chips that Nvidia and AMD have adapted to AI purposes and are used to train artificial intelligence models and algorithms. Those include computer vision, natural language processing and conversational AI.Washington’s latest salvo of restrictions triggered a selloff in Chinese tech stocks and narrowed the ability of international suppliers to sell or support chipmaking equipment in China. Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV withdrew support by US employees due to a new measure that precludes US citizens or green card holders from helping to make semiconductors that may have a military use in China. American suppliers like KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp. also distanced themselves from the country’s top chip plants.China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology summoned representatives from across its semiconductor sector to review the fallout from the latest US restrictions. Lawyers and executives at those firms are still assessing the full impact of the measures.--With assistance from Eric Martin.(Updates with Commerce Department comment in sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat the Alzheimer’s Drug Breakthrough Means for Other DiseasesThe Fantasy of Instant Delivery Is Imploding10 Takeaways From Matt Levine’s ‘The Crypto Story’From Bedrooms to Kitchens, Europe Ponders How Cold Is Too ColdThe Private Jet That Took 100 Russians Away From Putin’s War©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Cathie Wood is an American investor who is in charge of running the affairs of the investment firm Ark Investment Management. Ms. Wood set up her fund in 2014, which makes her fund one of the most successful players due to its large portfolio size but relatively young age in an industry filled with companies that have been investing for decades.Prior to setting up Ark, Ms. Wood spent a considerable amount of time working in the industry. She comes from a military background and is a graduate of the University of California, from which she graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in finance and economics. After graduating, Ms. Wood would go on and join one of the largest financial services firms in the world, Capital Group. She would work at the firm for three years and then head on to New York City for one of the longest stints of her career when she would spend 18 years working for an asset management firm.Her second attempt at setting up an investment firm would follow in 2014 when Ms. Wood would leave AllianceBernstein to focus on companies spearheading a concept called 'disruptive innovation.' This term, developed by a Harvard professor, is used primarily to explain the rise of companies such as Apple, which managed to upend the status quo through revolutionary products such as the iPhone.Over the years, her hedge fund has become one of the largest players in the industry, and as of the third quarter of this year, its portfolio was worth a whopping $14 billion. However, 2022 has proven to be one of the toughest ones in Ms. Wood's career, as her focus on disruptive firms, especially those in the technology sector, has coincided with Wall Street becoming risk averse in the aftermath of large interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Story continuesThese, according to the Fed, are necessary to bring down inflation, but Ms. Wood disagrees with the bank as she believes that the data points it is using to assess inflation are out of touch with reality. According to her, while the Fed is looking at consumer facing inflation for its decisions, prices have already started to drop upstream in the supply chain. She also argues that the prices for a host of commodities such as gold, silver, lumber, iron ore, DRAM, copper, oil, and corn are significantly down both year to date and since their peak highs.In an open letter that she penned in October 2022, Ms. Wood summed up her thoughts:The Fed seems focused on two variables that, in our view, are lagging indicators––downstream inflation and employment––both of which have been sending conflicting signals and should be calling into question the Fed’s unanimous call for higher interest rates. During September and early October, the Fed felt vindicated in its tough stance by reports that inflation as measured by both the CPI and PCE Deflator excluding food and energy increased 0.6% (7~-8% annualized) and that the PPI excluding food and energy increased 0.4% (~5% annualized). Including food and energy, the CPI increased and the PPI fell 0.1% (~1% annualized), however, while home prices as measured by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) fell 0.6% (~7-8% annualized). Reported on the employment front during September and early October, initial claims for unemployment insurance declined and nonfarm payroll employment increased 263,000, but job openings as measured by JOLTS fell 10% or 1.1 million, manufacturing employment as measured by the ISM Purchasing Managers Index contracted, and Challenger involuntary job separations soared 67.6% on a year-over-year basis.Cathie Wood's hedge fund has posted its 13F filings with the SEC for the third quarter of this year. Some of the notable names in the portfolio include Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM).

Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, beat once and met the same once, the average negative surprise being 3.35%.Q3 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $752.67 million, suggesting growth of 15.8% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at 24 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 9.1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteDexCom’s third-quarter top line is likely to have been aided by an increase in volume, courtesy of new patients across all channels and rising global awareness regarding the benefits of its real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (“CGM”). Potential robust contributions from the Sensor segment and domestic and international revenue growth are likely to be the key catalysts for third-quarter results.During the first half of 2022, the company continued making progress with respect to its objective of expanding access and accelerating its leadership in CGM-connected solutions and customer choice. DexCom launched the Dexcom ONE product in the United Kingdom and Spain during the second quarter. These developments are likely to have benefited customer growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.In March 2022, the company received the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation for the Dexcom CGM system’s use in the hospital setting. During the first quarter, DexCom secured the CE mark for the Dexcom G7 CGM System for monitoring people with diabetes aged two years and older and also initiated a limited launch of the system in Europe.

HSIC is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.16 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.57%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 11.73%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors to NoteDental BusinessHenry Schein’s dental business is likely to have gained from improved patient traffic as COVID-led severity gradually declines globally. The business is likely to have benefited from strong global equipment sales, similar to the last reported quarter, as dentists continue to invest in their practices. The dental business is likely to have seen robust sales contributions from dental specialty products, specifically within the oral surgery category.However, the company’s consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies, excluding PP&amp;E and COVID-related products,might have been impacted by the industrywide trend of staffing shortages in Q3.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHenry Schein, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteHenry Schein, in July 2022, acquired Condor Dental. This acquisition is expected to extend Henry Schein’s foray into the Swiss market for its dental distribution business. We expect this buyout to have a beneficial impact on the company’s results for the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter global Dental business revenues is pegged at $1.88 billion, suggesting a rise of 18.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Medical BusinessThe medical business is expected to have gained from improved U.S. patient traffic to physician offices, ultimate care sites and ambulatory surgical centers. The segment is likely to have witnessed continued demand for medical laboratory equipment and non-COVID point-of-care diagnostic tests, as it did in the previous quarter.Story continuesHowever, sales of personal protective equipment (PPE) products are likely to have continued the downward rally with declining COVID-19 cases globally in Q3 compared with the year-ago period. In this regard, Henry Schein earlier expected further pricing declines for gloves in the second half of 2022. Meanwhile, in terms of COVID-19 test sales, the company is likely to have witnessed lower COVID-19 testing demand in Q3, attributable to low infection rates. We expect this decrease in demand to have impacted the company’s third-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter global Medical business revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, suggesting a rise of 0.4% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.Technology and Value-Added Services BusinessHenry Schein’s technology and value-added services business is likely to have gained from continued strength in Henry Schein One, which provides one of the broadest product offerings of dental practice management and related software and services. The company is expected to have shown strength in its practice management business, including Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend.Per management, the growth within Henry Schein One in the second quarter was primarily driven by a recovery in patient traffic to dental offices and growth within the company’s cloud-based solutions. Healthy demand from the company’s national DSO accounts for Dentrix Ascend and Dentally cloud-based solutions contributed to the growth. We expect this growth momentum to have continued in Q3, benefiting the business.As of now, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter global Technology and Valued-Added Services business revenues is pegged at $187 million, suggesting an improvement of 10.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.22 billion implies an improvement of 1.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.15, indicating an increase of 4.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

HOLX is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 31, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37.68%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 54.09%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsWith COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have registered a sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, Hologic might have gained from the growing adoption of Panther instruments. The company’s efforts to validate and run more non-COVID assays on Panther systems might have offset the COVID-led loss to some extent. Further, its performance might have been driven bya combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and its respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion. In this regard, in the last reported quarter, Hologic’s vaginitis panel continued to outperform and deliver impressive growth, based on which the company noted that this vaginitis panel is well-positioned to become a top-three women's health assay within the molecular diagnostics portfolio. This might once again get reflected in the fiscal Q4 results.Breast HealthIn recent months, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage has aggravated due to persistent supply chain issues and the current geopolitical environment. This is likely to have impacted Hologic’s Breast Health business as it did in the prior-reported fiscal third quarter. The company’s interventional business has been facing supply chain headwinds related to disposable biopsy needles, hampering its performance.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteDespite these challenges, the company noted that the underlying demand for its Breast Health products remained robust, measured by healthy orders and rising backlog growth. This trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, benefiting the business arm.Story continuesGYN SurgicalHologic’s GYN Surgical business arm is likely to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures with the full-fledged opening up of the economy. The business is expected to have benefited from its acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder Surgical. Accessa's growth is driven primarily by two factors: first, its efforts to increase patient-covered lives to 84% compared with 26% when Hologic first acquired the business about two years ago. Second, its growth is also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Further, similar to the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate strong contributions from Bolder's CoolSeal devices to have added to the top-line performance. Hologic’s robust surgical product offerings, including the NovaSure, MyoSure, Acessa laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system and the Fluent fluid management system, are likely to have resulted in further gains for the business arm in Q4.The Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $866.8 million suggests a decline of 34.2% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 62 cents, indicating a decline of 61.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

The loss is expected to primarily stem from Hurricane Ian as well as other catastrophes, including U.S. convective storms, Typhoon Nanmadol and the hailstorms in France in June.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is currently pegged at 91 cents per share, which indicates an improvement of 23% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. We expect estimates to move south once analysts start incorporating loss estimates into their numbers.About 30% of this loss, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, will be absorbed by the property and casualty Insurance segment and the remaining 70% will be absorbed by the Reinsurance segment.Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation PGR incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results.  The Travelers Companies Inc.

In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Third Point discussed stocks like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Based in Burbank, California, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment company. On October 18, 2022, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock closed at $98.48 per share. One-month return of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was -5.75% and its shares lost 42.26% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has a market capitalization of $179.535 billion.Here is what Third Point specifically said about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""As disclosed in our Q2 letter, we reinitiated a significant position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) when the company retested its Covid lows earlier this year. At the current price, Disney is trading for little more than the stand-alone value of its Parks business and a mere 15x ’24 “street” consensus. The company remains early in its Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) transition with a leading market position, and yet the current stock price ascribes negligible value to the streaming business. We believe this is due to questions around the terminal economics of streaming, given large losses being generated today at Disney (&gt;$1 billion dollars last quarter) and stagnating margins at peers such as Netflix. On the last earnings call, management highlighted three items that could lead to an inflection in DTC profitability over the next 12 months: a 38% price increase for Disney+ in the US; moderating growth in cash content expense; and an advertising tier for Disney+ launching in two months that can drive additional ARPU given high demand for the Disney brand amongst advertisers.While the company has guided to Disney+ achieving breakeven sometime within the fiscal year ending September 2024, the valuation suggests the market remains skeptical. Disney only trades at ~14x the $7 in earnings generated prior to the Fox acquisition, which implies investors don’t expect earnings to meaningfully exceed this figure in the coming years. Hence, the first value driver we highlighted in our last letter is the opportunity for management to optimize Disney’s cost base to drive earnings growth. We believe Disney has ample means to rationalize costs across its operating platform and deliver targeted content for home viewing that does not entail the same cost structure of exclusive theatrical releases…” (Click here to view the full text)spatuletail/Shutterstock.comStory continuesThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in 12th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

""ComEd’s engineers are industry-leading innovators, and we’re honored to contribute our expertise and resources to find new technical solutions that will convince more consumers to switch to an EV.""XFC will allow EV owners to charge their vehicles at a much faster rate than a Level 1 or Level 2 EV charger. Level 1 chargers, which rely on standard 120V outlets and alternating current, are the slowest available charging method, taking approximately 50 hours to charge a standard 70kWh EV battery. Level 2 chargers utilize 240V outlets and require approximately 7.5 hours to fully charge a standard 70kWh battery.The XFC charger this project seeks to develop and demonstrate will be an ultra-low cost, all-silicon carbide modular power converter for direct current charging equipment which can connect directly to a medium voltage distribution system. With power capabilities of 300kWh, these chargers target reducing the time to fully charge a standard 70kWh EV battery to as little as 15 minutes.""The goal of this new project is to bring extreme fast charging much closer to market realization and support the continued adoption of electric vehicles by reducing consumers’ charge anxiety,"" said Srdjan Lukic, Ph.D., NC State professor, deputy director of FREEDM and Principal Investigator for the project. ""We could not achieve that without collaboration from project partners like ComEd.""Story continuesThe project will be broken into two phases focused on cost analysis &amp; system development and system demonstration, respectively. After the charging systems have been developed, ComEd’s Grid Integration and Technology (GrIT) Lab in Maywood, Ill., will serve as the initial testing location for this new technology—providing an independent validation of the XFC system performance. ComEd will also support phase two of the project by identifying ideal locations on the distribution grid to demonstrate this technology, unlocking the potential for wider deployment.The full $5 million XFC EV development and demonstration project is funded through collaborator cost shares including $200,000 from ComEd. Additional collaborators on this project include Danfoss, GoTriangle, New York Power Authority and North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center.The ComEd GrIT Lab reinforces ComEd’s commitment to supporting the grid of the clean energy future for its customers. The lab focuses on the impacts increased levels of renewable and beneficial electrification technologies will have on the grid. Previous projects from the GrIT Lab include the Bronzeville Community Microgrid, the first utility-operated microgrid cluster powered by DERs and controllable gas generation, and the ComEd Distribution Linear State Estimator, a software application that processes field data to estimate system voltages, currents, and electrical power flows for the distribution grid to enhance remote system monitoring and control capabilities.Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), the nation’s leading competitive energy provider, with approximately 10 million customers. ComEd provides service to approximately 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Price and EPS SurpriseF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderF5 Networks’ fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the hybrid work environment and the ongoing digital transformation wave, which is boosting the demand for secured communication networks.F5 Network’s sustained focus on transitioning the business into a software-driven model is anticipated to have aided the company’s overall performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. The surging demand for multi-cloud application services is expected to have been a key growth driver during the quarter.Growing traction for the Enterprise License Agreement and annual subscriptions by customers are likely to have boosted software growth in the to-be-reported quarter. F5 Networks expects revenues from the Software segment to increase in the 35%-40% range in full-fiscal 2022.However, the ongoing industry-wide supply-chain constraints for components are likely to have negatively impacted F5 Networks’ systems sales during the fiscal fourth quarter. This, in turn, is anticipated to have partially offset the benefits of the growth projection for the software business, thereby leading to much slower growth in overall Product segment revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues stands at $342 million compared with the year-ago reported figure of $340 million.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FFIV this season.

Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)Story continuesColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

344,dde351f9-1117-3f21-806a-5bbf6d35a155,CL,2022-10-21,‘We Are Seeing Very Attractive Valuations’: Billionaire Dan Loeb Likes These 2 Stocks in Particular,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeing-very-attractive-valuations-billionaire-153925057.html,1666280365,STORY,"['OVV', 'CL', 'TPNTF']","[Dan Loeb, founder and CEO of the New York-based asset management firm Third Point, has built a reputation for active investing and staking out aggressive market stances – and it’s a strategy that has worked for him. Since founding his fund in 1995, Loeb has built it into a Wall Street giant, with some $16 billion in total assets under management.While Loeb may be aggressive in his investment tactics, he keeps himself firmly rooted in reality, and his recent client letter has taken clear note of the way that economic conditions have worsened since the early summer. US inflation remains high, and core CPI is rising month-to-month, while across the Atlantic, the UK is facing a potential financial self-immolation after PM Liz Truss’s economic plan imploded in a spectacular fiasco that hammered the pound.But even in today’s volatile conditions, Loeb is finding opportunities, noting: “We are seeing very attractive valuations, particularly assuming an economic scenario short of financial Armageddon, and are taking up exposures as we speak...”So, let’s dig into the details of two stocks which make up a big chunk of Third Point's portfolio. Evidently, Loeb sees these as quality stocks, but he’s not the only one showing confidence in these names; according to the TipRanks database, Wall Street’s analysts rate both as 'Buys.'Ovintiv Inc.(OVV)We’ll start in the energy industry, where Ovintiv is a major player in the hydrocarbon exploration and production operations, with assets in the Texas Permian basin, the Oklahoma Anadarko fields, and the Montney formation on the British Columbia-Alberta border. Ovintiv, which has a market cap of $13 billion, has benefited greatly from the current inflationary environment, especially the increases in prices for oil and natural gas, and has seen 8 quarters in a row of rising revenues.Along with high revenues, Ovintiv has also seriously outperformed the overall markets – where we’ve seen a general bear this year, OVV stock is up 59% year-to-date.Story continuesOvintiv will report its Q3 results in early November, but a look at the company’s Q2 financial release gives a good picture of its current strength. Revenues in Q2 came to $4.04 billion, and net income was reported at $1.36 billion. Management reported that the company had its highest quarterly cash flow and free cash flow in more than 10 years, with the first metric at $1.22 billion and the second at $713 million.These solid results led Ovintiv to double its capital return percentage to shareholders, from 25% to 50% of non-GAAP free cash flow. The increase took place one quarter earlier than had been planned; cash returns to shareholders, through base dividends and share buybacks combined, reached $200 million in Q2. Ovintiv is guiding toward $389 million capital returns for Q3.A cash cow like Ovintiv, capable of delivering strong returns for investors both in cash and in share appreciation, is sure to attract attention from heavy hitters – and Dan Loeb first bought into OVV in Q1 of this year. In Q2, he increased his holding by 172%, buying 3.87 million shares of the stock. His stake in the company, as of August 15, totals 6.12 million shares and is worth over $323 million.This stock also drew the attention of Jefferies' Lloyd Byrne. The 5-star analyst is impressed by Ovintiv and writes: “We like OVV’s portfolio of top tier multi-basin assets with a balanced production portfolio, capital allocation optionality, and the price realization advantage associated with the multi-basin premium assets... OVV has continued to trade at a discount to the peer group, despite quality assets, improved balance sheet, strong management and return of capital strategy.""Along with his upbeat stance, Byrne rates the stock a Buy. His price target, at $75, implies a one-year upside potential of ~42%. (To watch Byme’s track record, click here)Overall, the bulls are definitely running on this stock. Ovintiv has 10 recent analyst reviews, and they are all positive – for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $52.66 and have an average price target of $67.60, suggesting an upside of ~28% in the next 12 months. (See OVV stock forecast on TipRanks)Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL)The next stock we're looking at is Colgate-Palmolive, one of the most recognizable names in the field of household cleaning goods, personal care items, and even pet care supplies. Colgate-Palmolive is best known for its eponymous products – the lines of Colgate toothpastes and Palmolive dish soaps. This is one of the classic defensive niches, as the company deals in product lines that consumers will still need even in a hard recessionary environment. With that in mind, Colgate-Palmolive has posted revenues above $4 billion in each of the last 8 quarters.In the most recent quarter, 2Q22, Colgate-Palmolive showed its highest revenue total of the past couple of years, at $4.4 billion. While revenues have been gradually increasing, however, earnings have been gradually slipping; the Q2 EPS was down 13% year-over-year to 72 cents per share.Despite the drop, the company’s earnings easily supported the common share dividend, declared last month for a November 15 Q3 payout at 47 cents per share. The annualized dividend, at $1.88 gives a modest yield of 2.6%, but the key point here is the dividend’s reliability. Colgate-Palmolive boasts that it has paid out ‘uninterrupted dividends’ going all the way back to 1895.This classic defensive stock made a logical addition for Loeb’s Third Point, given the firm’s stated strategy of defensive investing. Loeb’s firm took out a new position with CL in Q2, buying up 1.985 million shares. At current valuations, this stake is worth well over $140 million.Loeb laid out a series of reasons for Third Points strong buy into CL, saying: “First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation.”Looking ahead to the company’s upcoming Q3 print (October 28), Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers has a positive slant.""We expect CL to report a solid set of 3Q results, with lingering gross margin pressure (a product of still-high underlying inflation and building transaction FX headwinds) offset by strong organic growth (+7.5-+8%) balanced across geographic segments and Hill's. For full-year FY22, we see limited change to full-year EPS despite higher FX headwinds, as strong organic growth momentum, building productivity, and sequentially easing input and logistics cost pressures in 4Q should serve as offsets,” Powers noted.The analyst summed up, ""We remain positively biased on the CL story, as we see underlying improvement in Oral Care and strong momentum in Hill's benefitting further in today's economic climate from a consumer products portfolio skewing towards value.""Putting these bullish comments into a number, Powers gives CL an $85 price target, indicating potential for ~20% upside in the coming year. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)Overall, CL has a Moderate Buy rating from the Wall Street analyst consensus, based on 5 Buys and 7 Holds set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $70.95, and the average price target of $78.67 implies an upside potential of ~11%.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.3%.Revenues are expected to be $29.71 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast?For Comcast, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of $0.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.01, delivering a surprise of +10.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Comcast appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The report found that up to 65% of Comcast Business SecurityEdge™ customers experienced blocked attacks from July 2021 to June 2022, with up to 55% experiencing a botnet attack and nearly 50% experiencing malware and phishing attacks.The report – which analyzed anonymized threat data gathered from Comcast Business SecurityEdge as well as security insights from its partner Akamai – found that malware, botnet, and phishing attacks are among the most common internet threats SMBs have experienced over the last year. From July 2021 to June 2022, Comcast Business SecurityEdge helped protect SMBs from more than 70 million instances of malicious bot activity; 30 million phishing attempts; and 21 million attempts to access malware websites in a single day.""Attackers don’t just target large enterprises. Recent reporting shows companies with less than 100 employees are three times more likely to be the target of a cyberattack – yet, often lack sufficient cybersecurity measures and resources to manage their risk,"" said Shena Seneca Tharnish, Vice President, Cybersecurity Products, Comcast Business. ""Fortunately, through education and by implementing tools like anti-virus programs, firewalls and network security solutions, SMBs can help protect their employees, and customers from the ever-changing array of cybersecurity threats.""The 2022 Comcast Business Small Business Cybersecurity Report also found that:Bots were busy: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) botnet attacks target critical computing resources and websites to shut them down or disrupt service. Akamai researchers found and blocked large-scale botnets that use new features to hide malicious activities such as phishing, web proxying, malware delivery and selling stolen credentials and hacked credit card numbers.Financial and high-tech brands were the most targeted by phishing scams: Internet traffic shows that these industries were the most targeted, at 41% and 36%, respectively. A wide range of phishing campaigns enabling ransomware, offering fake prizes, demanding unnecessary payments, stealing credentials and more were identified and blocked.There was a myriad of malware activity: Hackers have a myriad of tricks to load malicious software from websites. Malware activity blocked by Comcast Business SecurityEdge was highly variable and diverse – including attempts to steal and secretly mine cryptocurrency, gather private information from computers, and enabling malware to continue to spread.Story continuesThe cost of cyberattacks can be high for small businesses. Comcast Business SecurityEdge can help businesses stay connected and protected by working seamlessly in the background to block threats like malware, ransomware, phishing, and botnet attacks across all connected devices. It helps ensure employee and guest devices are secure when connected to the network, while automatically scanning and refreshing every 10 minutes to identify new risks.""Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to target and disrupt businesses. Unfortunately, small and mid-size organizations are especially vulnerable because they may lack the security resources and expertise to combat these threats,"" said Jonathan Morgan, Vice President of Network Security Product Management at Akamai. ""Comcast has led with their innovative SecurityEdge service that makes it simple for SMBs to get foundational protections that are effortless to use. We’re proud to be their partner with our Secure Internet Access services that protect businesses of all sizes, and families, everywhere in the world.""""My small business doesn’t have the luxury of a dedicated IT department.

As of October 19, the S&amp;P 500 has tanked 23% since the beginning of 2022, the Nasdaq has lost about a third of its value year to date, and the Dow is down 17% for the year. Further sell-offs in the market may cause the S&amp;P 500 to plunge to as low as 3,000 points by year-end, said American billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Interactive Brokers, Thomas Peterffy, on October 19. Wall Street giants including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, and Citi, among others, have slashed their year-end forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 as inflation is showing no signs of coming down and the Fed is also not showing any signs of a pivot.The incessant rate hikes from the Fed have impacted markets negatively, triggering major sell-offs.

This will enable enterprise developers to quickly and swiftly create self-improving apps that could seamlessly integrate with their existing Oracle applications.Oracle Strengthens its Applications to Boost GrowthOracle Cloud Applications provide a customer with all the features needed to optimize business, make faster and better decisions, and outpace change. It also provides choice and flexibility as to when and how they can deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.This is helping Oracle to gain traction with users as recently Unilever integrated a few of their Oracle Fusion Applications with the autonomous database to build a next-generation super secure, super agile platform. The application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4 billion, up 37% in constant currency in first-quarter fiscal 2023.The E-Business Suite, which is an integrated set of Oracle’s business applications, has become the company’s major product line.

Shares of Oracle have lost 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology Sector, which declined 35.6%.Oracle is struggling to find stability in the cloud computing space as it had a late entry in it. The company faces tough competition from Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, which have a high brand value in cloud services.Microsoft’s Azure gears up for opening five data centers in the APAC region. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, cloud services’ revenues jumped 40% year over year, driven by robust growth in consumption-based business.Amazon continues to dominate the global cloud computing space on the back of an increasing number of availability zones and regions served by Amazon Web Services as it recently opened one in Bangkok, Thailand.Alphabet’s Google Cloud services have been growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI, and are expanding its footprint worldwide as the company is about to open a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia.To make a renowned space in cloud computing and catch up with its competitors, Oracle, which currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has been making significant investments in acquisitions.

(NASDAQ:MU)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-micron-143906506.html,1666276746,STORY,['MU'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$65.04 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$48.88. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Micron Technology's current trading price of US$53.03 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Micron Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology What Is Micron Technology Worth?The stock is currently trading at US$53.03 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 25% compared to my intrinsic value of $42.47. This means that the opportunity to buy Micron Technology at a good price has disappeared! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Micron Technology’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Micron Technology look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Micron Technology, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe MU is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MU for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its true value, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?If you want to dive deeper into Micron Technology, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

HAS is seeing a slowdown as consumers feel inflationary pressures. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings decline 11% this year.Hasbro is a global branded entertainment leader through gaming, consumer products and entertainment. Some of its brands including Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hasbro Gaming, Nerf, Transformers, Play-doh and Peppa Pig.A Miss in the Third Quarter of 2022On Oct 18, 2022, Hasbro reported its third quarter earnings and missed on the Zacks Consensus by $0.11. Earnings were $1.42 versus the Zacks Consensus of $1.53.Revenue fell 15%, or 12% on a constant currency basis, to $1.68 billion. The results were impacted by the acceleration of Consumer Products shipments by its retailers into the second quarter due to anticipated supply chain challenges, as well as Magic: The Gathering set releases and entertainment content scheduled for release in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter like last year.All three of its segments saw declines. Consumer Products, it's largest segment, fell 10% to $1.16 billion from $1.28 billion a year ago.Wizards and Digital Gaming fell 16% to $303.5 million from $360.2 million in 2021. Entertainment dropped 35% to $211.6 million from $327.1 million a year ago.Hasbro also saw ""increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer"" in the quarter.As a result, Hasbro guided to flat fourth quarter year-over-year revenue, with strength coming from its Wizards and Digital Gaming segment.The company also has a 3-year cost cutting program which is aimed to drive $250 to $300 million per year in savings.Full Year 2022 and 2023 Earnings Estimates CutGiven the earnings miss and the company's guidance, it's not surprising that analysts have been lowering earnings estimates.For 2022, 6 estimates were cut in the last 30 days, including 1 in the last week, which has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $4.65 from $5.09. That's an earnings decline of 11% because the company made $5.23 last year.Analysts are also bearish on 2023, with 6 estimates cut in the last 30 days and 2 cut in the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down to $5.38 from $5.68 during that time. However, that's still earnings growth of 15.7% from 2022.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCommitted to Its DividendHasbro pays a juicy dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.If you're worried that it may not be ""safe"" from cuts, in its press release, Hasbro said it was ""committed"" to its ""industry-leading"" dividend.The next quarterly dividend of $0.70 will be paid on Nov 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Nov 1, 2022.Shares are CheapHasbro shares are down 37% year-to-date and have entered into value territory.It trades with a forward P/E of 13.9 and has a P/S ratio of just 1.5.But if the US enters into a recession in 2023, will these shares get even cheaper?Investors interested in entertainment and gaming might want to wait on the sidelines for those earnings to turn back around before diving in.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The survey clearly shows that leaders who are making better decisions about risks are better prepared to navigate through and succeed during highly volatile times and economic uncertainty.Aon conducted more than 800 interviews with C-suite and senior executives at companies with 500+ employees to answer questions related to: What attributes set leaders who are very prepared for a recession apart? How are they making better decisions to position their companies for growth at this pivotal time?A strong majority (79 percent) of business leaders expect a recession this year. A highly select group of leaders—just 35 percent—report feeling very prepared for that recession.""Strong, prepared leaders are essential to protecting an organization's resilience and finding growth opportunities in the face of heightened volatility,"" said Greg Case, chief executive officer of Aon. ""This year's report reveals that leaders who are very prepared to weather economic challenges embrace calculated risk-taking as an engine of growth.""Business leaders who are very prepared for a recession share four fundamental attitudes toward preparedness:Embracing risk is the only option. Sixty-two percent of very prepared leaders agree that their company's appetite to address risk has increased in response to the current macroeconomic conditions. For companies that feel very prepared heading into a recession, addressing risk isn't a choice — it's a question of survival.Analysis and advice from internal and external stakeholders is vital in making better decisions. Very prepared leaders are nearly twice as likely to say they value the counsel of an external advisor to improve their company's ability to make good decisions and deal with risk. Confident leaders are also resisting the urge to slow hiring despite challenging economic conditions. In fact, 42 percent of very prepared leaders are spending a great deal of time on the issue of attracting and retaining top executive talent, compared to just 22 percent of other leaders.COVID-19 has shown that risks are interconnected. Sixty-one percent of very prepared leaders agree that risks are interconnected, drawing on their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. A strong majority (73 percent) of the best-prepared leaders strongly believe that the pandemic prepared them to respond quickly to emerging risks, giving them added confidence as they head into a recession.Don't hit the brakes on long-term investment — or ignore long-tail risks. The top five risks that all business leaders report they are most focused on are: inflation, a financial crisis, energy supply, cyber attacks and supply chain disruptions. In addition to addressing these risks, very prepared leaders are also looking ahead and spending more relative time than other leaders on longer-term challenges like economic/social inequality, disruptive technologies, crypto and blockchain. Similarly, about half (49 percent) of very prepared leaders are spending a great deal of time on climate change, compared to just 26 percent of other leaders.Story continues""Climate risk is not a probability, it is a certainty and severe weather is becoming more and more a part of everyday life,"" added Case. ""What this research shows us is that while climate change is one of our greatest challenges, it could also be one of our greatest opportunities. It is the ultimate example of the interconnectivity of risk. More companies are looking at the challenges caused by climate change beyond regulatory compliance and reputation management and are digging into the related risks where the impact is immediate and measurable – business interruption, material scarcity, supply chain issues and reputation damage. And we are seeing that the leaders who are investing more time and resources to the challenge are better prepared as a result.""The survey was conducted online from Sept. 2-15, 2022 by 815 C-suite, partner, senior executive and executive respondents at companies with 500+ employees across diverse industries in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

This has was narrower than the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 7.11% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.13% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McDonald's as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 27, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.57, down 6.88% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.71 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.79 per share and revenue of $22.62 billion, which would represent changes of +5.5% and -2.58%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

367,f504bcc0-e95a-3e19-b21c-1b049eabd572,MCD,2022-10-21,Analysts Estimate McDonald's (MCD) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mcdonalds-mcd-report-140102906.html,1666274462,STORY,"['MCD', 'WING']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when McDonald's (MCD) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.9%.Revenues are expected to be $5.71 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?For McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $2.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.55, delivering a surprise of +4.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McDonald's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Wingstop (WING) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.35 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +20.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $89.7 million, up 36.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Wingstop has been revised 1.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.57%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Wingstop will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

369,47997dad-7c7b-323f-bb9b-df3d6567f779,MCD,2022-10-21,15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-dow-companies-market-130005221.html,1666270805,STORY,"['^DJI', 'KO', 'HD', 'PG', 'DIS', 'CSCO', 'CVX', 'MRK', 'MCD', 'JPM']","[In this article, we will take a look at 15 of the biggest Dow companies by market cap. If you want to see more of the biggest Dow companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, is one of the oldest indexes in the world. Having been founded in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index is easily one of the most followed indexes in the world.Originally the The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprised of only 12 companies, mainly with operations in oil and gas, sugar, tobacco and railroads. As the U.S. economy evolved, however, so did the Dow index. Now the index includes 30 companies, with companies operating in many different sectors including technology. As it did before, the companies listed on the Dow today are among the leaders in their core fields.Given that it only includes 30 large capitalization U.S. companies, the Dow index arguably doesn't reflect the U.S. economy as well as another popular index, the S&amp;P 500, which includes 500 U.S. companies. Furthermore, since the Dow index is a price weighted index, stocks with higher stock prices have more influence on the index regardless of their market cap. Price weighted indexes are also affected by stock splits while market cap weighted indexes are not.While it has its limitations, The Dow Jones Industrial Average has nevertheless done well with the index rising from 40.45 on January 1, 1897 to 30,423.81 on 10/19/22.Given economic cycles, Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced bull and bear markets over the years.According to Guggenheim, the Dow Jones has experienced four secular bear markets in its history before this year. Each of the four secular bear markets lasted for over 10 years and the average annualized returns over those years were near zero or slightly negative. Meanwhile, the Dow has experienced 5 secular bull markets, each of which have lasted from 5 years to 17 years in length. The average annualized returns of those bull markets have been 8.72% or higher.Story continuesGiven the stock market's performance in 2022, it seems we are in a bear market, although it isn't a secular bear market.Due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates substantially this year, the markets have declined substantially. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen almost 17% year to date and S&amp;P 500 has fallen nearly 23% year to date.With inflation remaining high, it seems the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates even more. With the rate hikes and increasing probability of a recession in 2023, the markets could decline further if economic data doesn't meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of quality stocks across many different sectors. In the Dow Jones index, here are some leading stocks:MethodologyFor the 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap, we took the 15 largest stocks listed on the The Dow Jones Industrial Average by market capitalization as of 10/19 according to FINVIZ.com and we ranked them #15 to #1.15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $173.83 billionCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a leading maker of IP based networking and other products with a market capitalization of almost $174 billion as of 10/19. Although its shares are down 34% year to date, analysts are expecting Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to earn more money next year with an estimated next year EPS of $3.8 versus the trailing twelve month EPS of $2.82. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) also has a forward P/E of around 11 which could be attractive if the company keeps growing earnings.14. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $184.65 billionThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment conglomerate whose stock has fallen 36% year to date. Although economic headwinds could weigh on demand for The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the near term, the company remains well positioned in the long term given its great assets. If Disney+ can become the next Netflix, there could be even more upside in the long term.As of October 19, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) had a market capitalization of $184.65 billion, ranking it #14 on our list of 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.13. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $187.20 billionAlthough its shares are down around 6.5% year to date, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has done really well since 2015 with the stock having increased almost 150%. As a result, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the most valuable restaurant chain on the Dow with a market capitalization of $187.20 billion. If it continues its growth, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has more upside in the long term.12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $237.05 billionMerck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a leading pharmaceutical giant whose shares are near an all time high. Although the Dow is down almost 17% year to date, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares are actually up almost 22%. As a result, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has a market capitalization of $237.05 billion as of 10/19, ranking it #12 on our list of 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $245.92 billionThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a leading beverage company that's worth almost $246 billion as of 10/19. Given the relatively stable demand for its products, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares are only down 5.5% year to date and the company remains very profitable despite the economic headwinds. For the second quarter, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) reported adjusted EPS of $0.70 versus the consensus of $0.67 and revenue of $11.3 billion versus the consensus of $10.55 billion.10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $288.56 billionThe Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading retailer with a market capitalization of almost $290 billion that has been affected by the rising interest rates. Given that interest rates have increased, mortgage rates have surged since the beginning of the year, and demand for new housing is lower. With lower housing demand, demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s products isn't as strong. Although shares are down almost 34% year to date, housing demand will eventually normalize and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) will benefit.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $312.1 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a leading consumer staples company that's worth $312.1 billion. Although the stock isn't as attractive from a dividend perspective given the interest rate hikes, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is still attractive long term given the company's leading brands and earnings power. While inflation has caused some consumers to buy cheaper brands, there's a good chance the Federal Reserve will ultimately control inflation. If inflation is normal and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) keeps growing earnings, the company could remain one of the most valuable Dow stocks.8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $336.6 billionJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is the most valuable bank stock listed on the Dow given its market capitalization of $336.6 billion. Although JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) faces headwinds if a recession occurs and its stock could decline further, the company's CEO Jamie Dimon has been saying there could be a recession for a while and he has begun preparing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) to navigate the headwinds. If successful, the bank could be better positioned for growth in the future.7. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $339.4 billionChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the most valuable oil and gas company listed on the Dow given Salesforce replaced Exxon Mobil in 2020. Given that the price of oil and gas have increased substantially from the pandemic lows, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s profits have increased and its market cap is now around $340 billion as of October 19. In the longer term, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) will have to manage to transition to green energies successfully to keep growing.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $368.21 billionWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the most valuable retailer listed on the Dow with a market cap of almost $370 billion as of October 19. Although it arguably could be worth a lot more if it entered into e-commerce earlier, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is nevertheless very profitable given its annual net income of $13.51 billion in 2021. In terms of demand, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) CEO John Furner said that he is increasingly seeing new customers who were 'at higher incomes than what we have seen previously' and that there is still 'a lot of demand in the United States'.Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.Suggested articles:15 Best Countries to Live in the FutureMost Valuable Companies in HistoryTop 25 QQQ Stocks By Index WeightDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Tripadvisor Tripadvisor Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman of the Board Gregory Maffei bought US$1.1m worth of shares at a price of US$22.91 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$23.61. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the Tripadvisor insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Gregory Maffei was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Tripadvisor insiders own 1.0% of the company, worth about US$32m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Tripadvisor Insiders?The fact that there have been no Tripadvisor insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Tripadvisor insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares.

This compares to earnings of $1.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this staffing firm would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of 0.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Robert Half , which belongs to the Zacks Staffing Firms industry, posted revenues of $1.83 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.71 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Robert Half shares have lost about 27.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for Robert Half?While Robert Half has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Robert Half: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.58 on $1.86 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.32 on $7.46 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Staffing Firms is currently in the top 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Heidrick &amp; Struggles (HSII), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 24.This executive search firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.5%.

This simplifies the Company's go-to-market brand structure for clients and candidates and provides leverage for greater brand awareness and allows future flexibility to expand the Company's existing practice groups without the need for new brands. The Company's financial disclosures for contract talent solutions (formerly temporary and consultant staffing) are based on functional specialization rather than the previously branded divisions. The functional specializations are: finance and accounting, administrative and customer support, and technology. Finance and accounting combines the former Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources, administrative and customer support was previously OfficeTeam, and technology was formerly Robert Half Technology. Protiviti and permanent placement talent solutions continue to be reported separately. What was previously referred to as staffing operations is now referred to as talent solutions. There is no change to the underlying business operations or organization.The Company's presentation of service revenues for finance and accounting, administrative and customer support, and technology include intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the Company's blended business solutions. This is how the Company measures and manages these businesses internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti are aggregated and then eliminated as a single line item. The Company has prepared the below schedule to provide readers with historical comparative information to better evaluate the related trends.202020212022Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3SERVICE REVENUES:Finance and accounting$  701,762$  496,573$  506,515$  552,116$  600,387$  663,892$  732,365$  768,204$   801,690$  810,910$  805,229Administrative and customer support239,979136,299173,685214,985220,467263,192279,370295,872284,906274,141250,531Technology196,652162,028161,007175,730172,239194,233215,500213,414213,327218,190216,735Elimination of intersegment revenues (46,273)(41,514)(59,816)(92,393)(103,818)(143,036)(172,534)(161,004)(144,200)(137,548)(132,745)Total contract talent solutions1,092,120753,386781,391850,438889,275978,2811,054,7011,116,4861,155,7231,165,6931,139,750Permanent placement talent solutions120,48971,03087,20391,387111,703143,640156,444158,133186,782200,096182,329Protiviti294,082283,910321,303362,261397,402458,660501,421495,298472,329497,038511,376Total service revenues$  1,506,691$  1,108,326$  1,189,897$  1,304,086$  1,398,380$  1,580,581$  1,712,566$  1,769,917$  1,814,834$  1,862,827$  1,833,455 ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the ""Company"") are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; segment income; combined segment income; and as adjusted revenue growth rates.The following measures: adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; and segment income include gains and losses on investments held to fund the Company's obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. The Company provides these measures because they are used by management to review its operational results.Combined segment income is income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. The Company provides combined segment income because it is how management evaluates segment performance.Variations in the Company's financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days. The Company provides ""as adjusted"" revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company's functional specializations and segments on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global, U.S. and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because it focuses on the Company's revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.In order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates, as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year's comparable period. Management then calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all functional specializations and segments. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the Company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts. The term ""as adjusted"" means that the impact of different billing days and currency fluctuations are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation.The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages. ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INCNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN (UNAUDITED):(in thousands)Quarter Ended September 30,RelationshipsNine Months Ended September 30,RelationshipsAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs AdjustedAs ReportedAs Adjusted2022202120222021202220212022202120222021202220212022202120222021Gross MarginContract talent solutions$  449,579$  421,419$  449,579$  421,41939.4 %40.0 %39.4 %40.0 %$  1,376,293$  1,154,420$  1,376,293$  1,154,42039.8 %39.5 %39.8 %39.5 %Permanent placement talent solutions182,034156,170182,034156,17099.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %568,147411,122568,147411,12299.8 %99.8 %99.8 %99.8 %Protiviti155,996147,738153,296147,46130.5 %29.5 %30.0 %29.4 %430,562386,367412,603391,93229.1 %28.5 %27.9 %28.9 %Total$  787,609$  725,327$  784,909$  725,05043.0 %42.4 %42.8 %42.3 %$  2,375,002$  1,951,909$  2,357,043$  1,957,47443.1 %41.6 %42.8 %41.7 %The following tables provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin to reported gross margin for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:Quarter Ended September 30, 2022Quarter Ended September 30, 2021Contract talent solutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotalContract talent solutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotal$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of RevenueGross MarginAs Reported$  449,57939.4 %$  182,03499.8 %$  155,99630.5 %$  787,60943.0 %$  421,41940.0 %$  156,17099.8 %$  147,73829.5 %$  725,32742.4 %Adjustments (1)————(2,700)(0.5 %)(2,700)(0.2 %)————(277)(0.1 %)(277)(0.1 %)As Adjusted$  449,57939.4 %$  182,03499.8 %$  153,29630.0 %$  784,90942.8 %$  421,41940.0 %$  156,17099.8 %$  147,46129.4 %$  725,05042.3 %The following tables provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin to reported gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021Contract talent solutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotalContract talent solutionsPermanent placement talent solutionsProtivitiTotal$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$% of Revenue$]"

377,242c98c2-55fe-3e1a-b2c1-4ab4e3b3d313,TROW,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: T. Rowe Price (TROW) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-t-rowe-price-140102521.html,1666274462,STORY,['TROW'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when T. Rowe Price (TROW) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41%.Revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 20.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for T. Rowe?For T. Rowe, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.78%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that T. Rowe will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that T. Rowe would post earnings of $2.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.79, delivering a surprise of -20.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.T. Rowe doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Squeri.Travel and entertainment spending volumes in international markets surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time this quarter, he added.AmEx's revenue rose 24% to $13.6 billion in the third quarter, helped by a 21% jump in card member spending on the back of a rebound in cross-border travel as people shrugged off rising airfare to throng airports after a long hiatus due to the pandemic. The company added 3.3 million new proprietary cards.Still, the card lender built provisions of $778 million in the reported quarter to prepare for potential defaults, a sharp contrast from a year earlier when the economy's rapid recovery from the pandemic allowed it to release reserves of $191 million.Shares of the company were down 3.5% at $137.50 in premarket trading.AmEx's expenses rose 19% as it spent heavily on customer engagement and compensation.

389,e6dfbe14-3bac-37b5-bda7-312afd2e5fe7,PPL,2022-10-21,PPL's (NYSE:PPL) five-year decline in earnings translates into losses for shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppls-nyse-ppl-five-decline-163826697.html,1666283906,STORY,['PPL'],"[Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 33% over a half decade. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 14% in a month. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 6.1% in the same time period.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$994m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the five-year loss for shareholders. View our latest analysis for PPL In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, PPL moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.It could be that the revenue decline of 5.6% per year is viewed as evidence that PPL is shrinking. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthPPL is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling PPL stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for PPL the TSR over the last 5 years was -13%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, PPL shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 9.9% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 24%. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it's worse than the annualised loss of 2% over the last half decade. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PPL better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - PPL has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.We will like PPL better if we see some big insider buys.

390,976b9076-41a9-3550-95dc-d09ddb72d599,RMD,2022-10-21,ResMed (RMD) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmed-rmd-earnings-expected-grow-140202837.html,1666274522,STORY,['RMD'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when ResMed (RMD) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of medical products for respiratory disorders is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.3%.Revenues are expected to be $942.12 million, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ResMed?For ResMed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ResMed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that ResMed would post earnings of $1.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.49, delivering a surprise of +0.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.ResMed doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

391,47fb2166-bee6-3c41-8e10-e0cd34d18619,TSCO,2022-10-21,Analyst Report: Tractor Supply Company,Morningstar Research,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/47fb2166-bee6-3c41-8e10-e0cd34d18619/analyst-report%3A-tractor.html,1666298172.0,STORY,['TSCO'],[]

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this retailer for farmers and ranchers a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Tractor Supply is 26%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -10.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Tractor Supply is 23.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 16.9% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 13.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Tractor Supply. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineTractor Supply has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Tractor Supply well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Both metrics improved year over year.Despite the inflationary pressure, the results have gained from continued market share, strength in the Life Out Here Strategy and healthy demand for its product categories. Consequently, management has raised its 2022 view to reflect the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, which is likely to contribute $75 million to sales in the fourth quarter and 2022.Despite the impressive results and the raised 2022 view, the TSCO stock rose more than 1% in the pre-market trading session on Oct 20. However, shares of the company have lost 16.6% year to date but came ahead of the industry’s 42% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q3 DetailsTractor Supply’s earnings of $2.10 per share improved 7.7% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.Net sales jumped 8.4% year over year to $3,270.8 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,284 million. The improvement was driven by an increase of 5.7% in comps, led by growth of 7% in comparable average tickets, which offset a 1.3% decline in comparable average transaction count.Also, a sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comps growth.The gross profit rose 7.4% year over year to $1,165.8 million, while the gross margin contracted 32 basis points (bps) to 35.6%. Pricing efforts and other initiatives to drive margins partly offset cost inflation, higher transportation costs and the unfavorable product mix.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 16 bps to 26.3%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 9% year over year to $859.4 million. Investments in strategic efforts, and hourly wages and benefits were partly offset by normalized incentives, reduced COVID-19 response costs, and leverage in occupancy and other costs.The operating income advanced 3.1% year over year to $306.4 million in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the operating margin contracted 48 bps to 9.4%.Story continuesFinancial PositionTractor Supply ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $211.2 million, long-term debt of $1,077.9 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $1,941.1 million.In the nine months ending Sep 24, 2022, the company incurred a capital expenditure of $451.2 million and generated a cash flow from operating activities of $626.3 million. Capital expenditure is expected to be $650-$700 million for 2022.In the third quarter, Tractor Supply returned $225.5 million to its shareholders, including $123.6 million to repurchase 0.6 million shares and $101.9 million as quarterly cash dividends.Store UpdateIn the quarter under review, the company opened 11 Tractor Supply stores and two Petsense stores. As of Sep 24, 2022, it operated 2,027 Tractor Supply stores across 49 states and 180 Petsense stores in 23 states. On Oct 12, TSCO acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home, which will be rebranded as Tractor Supply by the end of 2023.Management remains on track with its store-opening initiatives.

This compares to earnings of $1.95 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this retailer for farmers and ranchers would post earnings of $3.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.53, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Tractor Supply , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $3.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.41%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.02 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Tractor Supply shares have lost about 17.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for Tractor Supply?While Tractor Supply has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tractor Supply: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) share price is up 39% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 5.4% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Mondelez International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Mondelez International's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Mondelez International's TSR for the last 5 years was 55%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Mondelez International shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 3.2% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mondelez International better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In.Momentum investing has long been a popular strategy among expert investors and retail investors alike. Simply put, momentum investors buy a stock when it is in an upward trend and sell it when it starts to look as if it has peaked or is going to go into a downward trend. Momentum investing is highly vulnerable to market volatility and may or may not turn out as expected. Investors should always practice proper due diligence and make informed investment decisions. The stock market has been shaky in 2022, with global supply disruptions, geopolitical unrest, alarmingly high inflation, and rising interest rates. As of October 20, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 23.2% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 32.5% for the year, and the Dow has tanked 16.75% since the beginning of 2022.While equities have been having a bad year, overall, market pullbacks may be optimal buying opportunities for investors. On October 20 Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he gave his S&amp;P 500 projections and talked about investing in stocks on pullbacks. Mark Newton thinks that ""we need to see rates start to peak out before we can really see if any sort of rally has some longevity"" and that though the ""S&amp;P seems like it's going down every day, but there's actually some internal sector strength that really bodes well with the prospect of markets to bottom out by the beginning of November"".Mark Newton said that according to his research, interest rates are approaching a peak, and with the upcoming mid-term election and the FOMC meeting in November, markets are ready for a near-term rebound so ""any pullbacks would still be a great buying opportunity"" for investors.Some of the best momentum stocks that have the potential to soar further as we move into the end of the year include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).

Subsequently, fertilizer inventory began to accumulate in various locations including in Brazil as farmers refused to buy normal amounts of fertilizer due to high prices. An effort by the U.S. government to aid exports of Russian fertilizer also may have weighed on sentiment. We view the agriculture markets as still in a bull trend, but the pullback in Mosaic and other fertilizer names was substantial.”Some of the best momentum stocks that have gained over 100% in 2022 include Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc (NYSE:AMR).11.

In addition, the company’s ongoing mix shift to higher-margin, premium products, a catalyst we previously identified, is aiding both sales and profit growth. Shares were likely also buoyed by the rise in crop prices. Market participants, perhaps eager to chase short-term trends, poured into the sector. At Aristotle Capital, we look past such gyrations and, as long-term investors, do not attempt to predict short-term changes in commodity prices. We remain excited about what we view to be high-quality characteristics and fundamental improvements that permeate Corteva’s business, not the least of which include its pricing power.”9.

406,bb574ed9-bf84-3c38-a3f6-1b7447a49dfd,BSX,2022-10-21,"Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) jumps 3.4% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-nyse-bsx-jumps-172300215.html,1666286580,STORY,['BSX'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) share price is up 38% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 7.9% in that time.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Boston Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 0.05% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 7% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 70.74.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Boston Scientific shareholders can take comfort that their trailing twelve month loss of 7.9% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Boston Scientific (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBoston Scientific is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

407,596cc8c6-6c41-3dee-8c60-bdf163724d30,BSX,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-lemaitre-vascular-lmat-140202191.html,1666274522,STORY,"['LMAT', 'BSX']","[LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.7%.Revenues are expected to be $40.13 million, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.63% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LeMaitre?For LeMaitre, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LeMaitre will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that LeMaitre would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of -9.38%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.LeMaitre doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerBoston Scientific (BSX), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.44 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +7.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.14 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Boston Scientific has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.63%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Boston Scientific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Basswood Capital's strategy and Matthew Lindenbaum's background and go directly to 5 Best Bank Stocks to Buy According to Matthew Lindenbaum's Basswood Capital.Matthew Lindenbaum is a General Partner at Basswood Capital Management. After getting an undergraduate degree from Brandeis University, Matthew began his career at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, where he worked in the mortgage finance group. Shortly after that, he worked at SNL Securities, LLC, where he went on to become a General Partner. Matthew has over 35 years of industry experience and, over the course of his career, has served in various top positions, including serving as Vice Chairman of Community National Bank and Director at Garden State Bancshares.Basswood Capital Management L.L.C. is an asset management company operating out of New York.

Corporation (NYSE:FNB), Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), and Webster Financial Corporation (NYSE:WBS).Our MethodologyWe picked the top 10 bank stocks from Basswood Capital's portfolio as of its Q2 2022 filing.Best Bank Stocks to Buy According to Matthew Lindenbaum's Basswood Capital 10. Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF)Basswood Capital Stake: $38,042,000 Percentage of Basswood Capital's Portfolio: 2.39%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a financial services holding corporation based in McLean, Virginia.

The analyst maintained that the company is trading at highly attractive valuation levels, and there is very limited downside risk on the stock from the current levels. He currently has an Outperform rating on the company's stock with a target price of $130.Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund had to say about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is, in fact, so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year's cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Capital One Financial.At the end of the second quarter, Fisher Asset Management had a total holding of 7,848,053 shares in the company making the fund leading stakeholder of Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF).

Basswood Capital's exposure in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) amounts to a total value of over $49 million as of its reported filing for the period ending June 2022. The fund decreased its holding of the company's shares by 24% during the previous quarter.On September 12, 2022, Matt O'Connor, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, reduced his price target on the company's stock to $60. Although the analyst has maintained a Buy rating on the company's stock, he believes that the chances of a recession are increasing, which will possibly cause more downside in the market, including stocks in the banking sector.Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:The absolute level of revenues and profits generated by such companies is in fact so large that most of the major financial holdings in the portfolio produce enough annual operating income individually that a number of them could, in theory, purchase several entire businesses among hundreds of choices within the S&amp;P 1500 Index, using just a year's cash earnings without dipping into capital. This is theoretical, as financial companies would not be in the business of buying healthcare or technology companies, for example, but we point out these facts to illustrate the sheer scale of the economics produced by single financial companies in a given year, which is often a multiple of the cash earnings yielded by companies in a host of other industries.Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view.

409,591cdc0e-5220-3661-9179-1d93db28ceff,COF,2022-10-21,Earnings Preview: Capital One (COF) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-capital-one-cof-140102892.html,1666274462,STORY,"['COF', 'COF-PJ', 'OMF']","[The market expects Capital One (COF) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27%.Revenues are expected to be $8.59 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Capital One?For Capital One, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capital One will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Capital One would post earnings of $5.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.96, delivering a surprise of -3.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Capital One doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerOneMain Holdings (OMF), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.23 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -48.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $900.45 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for OneMain has been revised 3.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.63%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that OneMain will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Honeywell makes products like avionics and engines for business jets and flight management systems for commercial jets.""The story is very simple: getting our forecast right and putting the demand in front of our suppliers a lot earlier,"" Gupta said. ""It provides a very clear picture for our suppliers on what they need to deliver.""Gupta said his division would support European planemaker Airbus SE's longer-term production goal of 75 A320 family jets a month in 2025, up from around 50 in 2022. Some manufacturers have questioned whether a battered supply chain could keep up with the target.Story continues""If they want to execute 75, we will execute 75,"" he said.Smaller suppliers, struggling with higher costs and labor shortages, are pushing manufacturers to order many months in advance to assuage concerns over a possible economic slowdown.But ordering earlier also means making payments sooner, raising working capital, and delaying when manufacturers can recoup expenses on the plane or part's delivery.ROBUST ORDER BOOKTo mitigate additional costs, some private planemakers are asking customers for larger deposits on jets before delivery, said one corporate planemaker executive who asked not to be identified.Business aviation rebounded faster than commercial traffic in the United States last year as wealthy travelers opted to fly on private jets and avoid crowded airports during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Gulfstream Aerospace orders roughly six months to a year out, compared with a previous ""just in time"" strategy, President Mark Burns said.Burns said the company's robust order book has more than offset any possible impact on working capital.Longer lead times also add an additional risk of unwanted inventory in the event of a downturn, analysts say.""The longer lead times stay high, the more of a risk to earnings in our view,"" Bank of America Global Research analyst Andrew Obin said.That has companies supporting constrained suppliers with advice and staffing like machinists and engineers, often at the same time.""The only caveat is if we send you help, you have to work on our stuff first,"" said Ron Draper, president of Cessna business jet maker Textron Aviation in an interview.""We’ve been at some of these suppliers and we see a lot of other OEMs in the visitor logs.""Still, Gulfstream Aerospace's Burns and others are more optimistic about supplier performance with deliveries getting closer to the desired dates. ""We've kind of plateaued and will see improvements into 2023."" (Reporting by Allison Lampert in Orlando, Fla.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, up 7.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron?For Textron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Textron would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Textron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, Boeing (BA), is soon expected to post loss of $0.09 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +85%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $18.27 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Boeing has been revised 10.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Boeing will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.57 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this railroad would post earnings of $2.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.93, delivering a surprise of 3.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Union Pacific , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, posted revenues of $6.57 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.95%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.57 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Union Pacific shares have lost about 20.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.5%.What's Next for Union Pacific?While Union Pacific has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Union Pacific: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.08 on $6.38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.57 on $24.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Rail is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Norfolk Southern (NSC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 26.This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19%.

419,0f44683d-0a9d-3b94-a4ec-666e20a0d16c,KO,2022-10-21,A Closer Look At The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) Impressive ROE,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/closer-look-coca-cola-companys-110108744.html,1666350068,STORY,['KO'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:39% = US$9.6b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.39 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCoca-Cola's Debt And Its 39% ROECoca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.73. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

If you want to read about some more large cap stocks, go directly to 5 Best Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now.Economic experts are forecasting a broad recession in the United States in the next few months due to runaway inflation, interest rates going up more than expected, the unknown effects of quantitative tightening, and the impact of the Russian war in Ukraine. Recently, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest and well-reputed banks in the US, told news platform CNBC that a very, very serious mix of headwinds was likely to tip both the US and global economy into recession by the middle of next year.Dimon was of the opinion that even though a recession was more than likely, the US economy appeared to be in much better shape than before the last big financial meltdown in 2008. The executive also criticized the central bank for waiting too long and doing too little as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, but acknowledged that it was now clearly catching up. The comments of Dimon echo those of other top experts. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, has said that the economy is on a bumpy journey to a better destination. El-Erian made the comments during an appearance on CBS, in which he stressed that the main source of volatility in the markets was the changing perceptions of the Federal Reserve. He added that the central bank had mischaracterized inflation as transitory earlier this year and did not act in a meaningful way after inflation remained persistent and high. This has battered the markets but also means that large-cap stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are trading at discounts.Our MethodologyThe companies that have market capitalizations greater than $10 billion were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues11 Best Large Cap Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Large Cap Stocks to Buy Now11.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”8.

Here is what the fund said:“In financials, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has done an excellent job demonstrating the resiliency of its franchise in the midst of a global pandemic that drove a 60% decline in its core travel and entertainment business. The company’s spend-centric model has been helped by fiscal stimulus ensuring a flush consumer, while management continues to execute well by adding millions of new consumer and small and medium business accounts, which should benefit the franchise over the medium to long term. We remain optimistic regarding the company’s prospects as travel and entertainment activity rebounds, adding to our position in the quarter.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in retail and wholesale of general merchandise worldwide. It is one of the elite large cap stocks to invest in.

Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart and Costco has been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions.

In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

If you want to see more of the biggest Dow companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, is one of the oldest indexes in the world. Having been founded in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index is easily one of the most followed indexes in the world.Originally the The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprised of only 12 companies, mainly with operations in oil and gas, sugar, tobacco and railroads. As the U.S. economy evolved, however, so did the Dow index. Now the index includes 30 companies, with companies operating in many different sectors including technology. As it did before, the companies listed on the Dow today are among the leaders in their core fields.Given that it only includes 30 large capitalization U.S. companies, the Dow index arguably doesn't reflect the U.S. economy as well as another popular index, the S&amp;P 500, which includes 500 U.S. companies. Furthermore, since the Dow index is a price weighted index, stocks with higher stock prices have more influence on the index regardless of their market cap. Price weighted indexes are also affected by stock splits while market cap weighted indexes are not.While it has its limitations, The Dow Jones Industrial Average has nevertheless done well with the index rising from 40.45 on January 1, 1897 to 30,423.81 on 10/19/22.Given economic cycles, Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced bull and bear markets over the years.According to Guggenheim, the Dow Jones has experienced four secular bear markets in its history before this year. Each of the four secular bear markets lasted for over 10 years and the average annualized returns over those years were near zero or slightly negative. Meanwhile, the Dow has experienced 5 secular bull markets, each of which have lasted from 5 years to 17 years in length. The average annualized returns of those bull markets have been 8.72% or higher.Story continuesGiven the stock market's performance in 2022, it seems we are in a bear market, although it isn't a secular bear market.Due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates substantially this year, the markets have declined substantially. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen almost 17% year to date and S&amp;P 500 has fallen nearly 23% year to date.With inflation remaining high, it seems the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates even more. With the rate hikes and increasing probability of a recession in 2023, the markets could decline further if economic data doesn't meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of quality stocks across many different sectors. In the Dow Jones index, here are some leading stocks:MethodologyFor the 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap, we took the 15 largest stocks listed on the The Dow Jones Industrial Average by market capitalization as of 10/19 according to FINVIZ.com and we ranked them #15 to #1.15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap15.

(NYSE:HD) is a leading retailer with a market capitalization of almost $290 billion that has been affected by the rising interest rates. Given that interest rates have increased, mortgage rates have surged since the beginning of the year, and demand for new housing is lower. With lower housing demand, demand for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)'s products isn't as strong. Although shares are down almost 34% year to date, housing demand will eventually normalize and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) will benefit.9. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Market Capitalization as of 10/19: $312.1 billionThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a leading consumer staples company that's worth $312.1 billion. Although the stock isn't as attractive from a dividend perspective given the interest rate hikes, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is still attractive long term given the company's leading brands and earnings power.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis flooring maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.9%.Revenues are expected to be $3.08 billion, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mohawk Industries?For Mohawk Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mohawk Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mohawk Industries would post earnings of $4.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.41, delivering a surprise of +1.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The firm said that the company is well-positioned in the current environment.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share. In 2022, the company marked its 49th consecutive year of dividend growth. As of October 19, the company's shares have a yield of 1.67%.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was a popular buy among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned positions in it, up from 60 a quarter earlier. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $3.78 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Dividend Yield as of October 19: 1.67%Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) provides property, health, and reinsurance services to its consumers. The company is headquartered in Zurich.

Viking Global owned the largest position in the company, holding shares worth $742 million.Aristotle Capital Management mentioned Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our investment in Chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015, shortly after ACE Limited announced it would acquire the Chubb Corporation, creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income. During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

(NASDAQ:INTU) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-shares-intuit-inc-120121100.html,1666353681,STORY,"['INTU', 'TROW']","[If you want to know who really controls Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuit. View our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Intuit does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuit's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Intuit is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 6.3% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of IntuitWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in Intuit Inc.. Insiders own US$3.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuit better, we need to consider many other factors.

435,15c2b3da-9cbe-3506-abe1-f37a79ce671c,INTU,2022-10-21,7 Software Stocks to Buy on the Dip or Kick Yourself Later,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-software-stocks-buy-dip-165952499.html,1666025992,STORY,"['TTD', 'MSFT', 'CRWD', 'BAH', 'LMND', 'INTU', 'IOT']","[The idea of software stocks to buy on the dip seems incredibly treacherous given the volatility. One of the core catalysts of the latest red wave centers on the Federal Reserve. First, the Fed has an undue influence on world affairs because of the pure hegemony of American economic might. Second, the central bank is committed to a hawkish monetary policy.While I don’t want to turn this discussion into an economics lecture, the reality is that as borrowing costs rise, companies will unsurprisingly borrow less. Therefore, corporations will produce less earnings than analysts previously anticipated. Therefore, many securities, particularly those tethered to growth-centric names. must undergo a “re-risking” process if you will.In other words, Wall Street must reassess the risk profile of equities based on the Fed’s monetary paradigm shift. Unfortunately, this re-risking causes pain, lots of it, as you can clearly see. At the same time, astute contrarians can use this macabre adjustment phase to secure software stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are some quality names to consider.CRWDCrowdStrike$152.32BAHBooz Allen Hamilton$95.88MSFTMicrosoft$236.04INTUIntuit$399.92LMNDLemonade$21.58TTDTrade Desk$54.47IOTSamsora$11.28CrowdStrike (CRWD)Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity firm. Specifically, it provides cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. Fundamentally, CrowdStrike should gain from pure relevancies. In 2021, the average number of cyberattacks and data breaches increased 15.1% from the previous year.Unfortunately, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way, at least not yet. On a year-to-date basis, CRWD slipped over 26% through the Oct. 14 session. However, this volatility appears irrational based on the company’s significantly undervalued profile. While the company presently lacks robust substance in the earnings department, it makes up for it in growth. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 63.6%, ranked better than 95% of the competition.Story continuesAlso, keep in mind that CrowdStrike enjoys financial resilience. I’m not going to tell you that it has the greatest balance sheet in the world. However, with an Altman Z-Score of 7.72, which is a lofty figure, the cybersecurity expert enjoys less probability of bankruptcy than its peers.Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is an American management and information technology consulting firm. The company’s stated core business is to provide consulting, analysis and engineering services to public and private sector organizations and nonprofits. Fundamentally, Booz Allen Hamilton is a vital cog in several government agencies.Not surprisingly given its relevance, BAH ranks among the rare companies to be up this year, gaining 7%. However, BAH did have a comparatively rough week last week, declining a little more than 3%. Therefore, it technically qualifies as one of the software stocks to buy on the dip.Financially, the company enjoys a mixture of strong growth, profitability and quality. For instance, Booz Allen’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 9.8%, rated better than nearly 74% of its peers. Regarding net margin, this metric pings at nearly 6%, superior to 60% of the underlying industry.Finally, the company features a return on equity of 48%, ranking better than 95% of its rivals. Additionally, such a high stat indicates the tremendous quality of its business.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA powerhouse in the consumer electronics and business software space, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents a must-have, fundamentally. From an academic and professional perspective, the company’s Software as a Service (specifically its software suite of business applications) presents an irreplaceable platform. For instance, if you consider the desktop operating system market share, Microsoft Windows utterly dominates everyone else.However, as usual on this list of software stocks to buy on the dip, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. Since the start of the year, MSFT fell nearly 32%. Even more recently, the security can’t seem to catch a break, losing 7% in the trailing month. However, investors on the sidelines may be missing a great opportunity. Per Gurufocus.com, MSFT rates as modestly undervalued.Further, the company enjoys excellent financial metrics across the board. First, the company features a stable balance sheet, with a high Altman Z-Score of 7. In terms of key three-year growth statistics, they’re all in double-digit territory and above sector average. Finally, MSFT represents a high-quality business among software stocks to buy, enjoying a return on equity of 46%, ranking better than 97% of its peers.Intuit (INTU)APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.Source: ShutterstockUnless you’re an employee anticipating a nice refund, not many others enjoy tax season. The paperwork can be complicated and onerous. In addition, some entrepreneurs may owe money to Uncle Sam. However, business and accounting software giant Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) helps make this time of the year a little less  taxing.While I don’t want to say that Wall Street misses the point (it sounds terribly arrogant) with INTU, it really does seem like it’s missing the point. I simply look to the gig economy. You can look at various projections. However, the consensus is that the gig economy represents a burgeoning market.Because tax implications for gig workers, or independent contractors feature greater complexities than employees (all other things being equal), INTU has a long upside pathway. That’s the fundamental argument. Financially, the company features a solid balance sheet, strong growth (based on book expansion) and excellent profitability metrics. Intuit’s return on equity stands at 15%, better than nearly 78% of the industry.Lemonade (LMND)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockWhile Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) may be an insurance app and therefore perhaps not everyone’s idea of software stocks to buy on the dip, apps do represent a type of software. Therefore, I’m going to stick it on this list.Fundamentally, Lemonade brings many relevancies to the table. Let’s face it, the insurance business is boring as heck. However, Lemonade integrated much-needed tech into the staid industry, making the process easier for younger users – its core base. Using the platform, people can acquire renters, homeowners and car insurance. As well, Lemonade offers pet insurance. Since millennials love pets, this particular offering represents smart business.However, Wall Street sadly is pessimistic on the company. Since the beginning of this year, LMND slipped 52%. To be fair, Lemonade isn’t exactly bringing the heat in terms of profitability. But it is driving home the growth angle. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate currently flies at 60%. That above 96% of the competition.If you can handle some volatility, LMND might belong on your list of software stocks to buy on the dip.Trade Desk (TTD)The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comIn any other circumstance, red ink for Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) would probably automatically qualify for software stocks to buy on the dip. Unfortunately, present circumstances demand greater vigilance. Trade Desk specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users.Sounds neat. But here’s the problem.  The digital advertising space really stinks. That’s not necessarily my assessment but one from Mark Zuckerberg. With global recession fears mounting, companies understandably feature a gun shy profile about fund outlays. Therefore, TTD slipped nearly 44% since the beginning of this year.Could this be a contrarian opportunity, though? Gurufocus.com labels Trade Desk as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations. From my angle, I see excellent growth stats, such as a blistering high 68% three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate.On the balance sheet, its Altman Z-Score ranks as a lofty 9.25, indicating great stability. TTD is worthwhile if fundamentally undervalued software stocks to buy is your thing.Samsara (IOT)a visual representation of the internet connections crisscrossing the sky above a citySource: ShutterstockSamsara (NYSE:IOT) develops a connected operations platform for tracking fleets of vehicles and other equipment. While the immediate recession cloud presents a dour environment for innovative software stocks to buy, over time, Samsara should garner substantial relevance.For now, IOT desperately attempts to tread water amid a hurricane. Shares slipped 59% for the year and nearer-term price action don’t present much encouragement. For instance, in the trailing month, IOT stock fell slightly over 14%. Still, astute investors will likely point to its strong growth and stable balance sheet.To be fair, IOT is a young investment, having made its public debut in December of last year. Therefore, its profitability metrics are terrible if I’m being perfectly honest. However, the company’s Altman Z-Score of 5 points indicates a business safe from immediate bankruptcy risk. Combined with double-digit growth trends, Samsara offers an enticing package for discount lovers.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

436,7d36fd9a-305f-39fd-85ee-be8f9d30a528,DVA,2022-10-21,7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-204518579.html,1666039518,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'MCK', 'AXP', 'AAPL', 'CVX', 'KO', 'KR', 'DVA']","[Warren Buffet’s philosophy relies on identifying stocks to buy and hold. He believes that the best names to buy and hold are those of undervalued companies that have high chances of being successful over the long term. That investment strategy is embodied by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) which invests in those types of equities and other varieties of stocks as well.  Over the previous decade, BRK.B has provided annualized returns of 11.39%. However, investors who want to find other individual Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold would do well to consider these seven names. KOCoca-Cola$55.69AAPLApple$142.41AXPAmerican Express$141.54KRKroger$42.11MCKMcKesson$354.50DVADaVita$89.88CVXChevron$161.31InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCoca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comMany investors are aware of the connection between Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock and Warren Buffett. Buffett famously showed Coca-Cola products on TV during his press interviews and reportedly continues to drink five cans of Coke daily. Buffett clearly enjoys the company’s products. More importantly, for investors, he loves the company’s shares. Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million of Coca-Cola’s 4.32 billion outstanding shares. Consequently, his views on Coca-Cola’s prospects move its share prices significantly. So any purchase or sale of KO stock by Berkshire Hathaway is consequential. Berkshire did not buy or sell KO stock in Q2. But the company’s decision to hold onto all of its KO stock  shows that it remains confident in the name.  Coca-Cola’s long-term outlook remains very solid, and the mature firm is clearly capable of continuing to drive top-line growth and provide investors with returns. Its revenues increased from $37.3 billion in 2019 to $38.7 billion in 2021. During the same period, its earnings per share went from $2.11 to $2.32. All of this indicates that Coca-Cola will grow steadily over the next decade. The company will continue to return money to investors via its dividend which has not been reduced since 1963. Story continuesApple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the most successful stocks over the past decade. During that period, the annualized return of AAPL stock averaged 21.17%. Those returns outpaced those of the tech-heavy Nasdaq by 81%. Capital invested in Apple’s shares multiplied in value by nearly seven times in that span of time. If past is prologue, buying and holding Apple’s shares for the next decade is a smart idea. The outlook of AAPL stock remains bright moving forward. Quantitative tightening has drastically impacted tech stocks  in 2022. But one firm believes that Apple’s shares can more than double in price in the next five years, reaching nearly $360. The same source predicts that Apple could rise to $445 by 2032.  AAPL stock constitutes the largest holding in Warren Buffett’s portfolio, accounting for more than 40% of the value of his stocks. It appears that Apple will remain among the most important companies in the world for the next decade. Consumer demand isn’t waning despite the economy’s slowdown, and Apple reported record revenues when its earnings were released in late July. It’s an easy, smart choice. American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) stock is in a unique position. Like all companies, American Express may have to cope with a recession. Almost every company’s financial results are negatively impacted by recessions. American Express could fare better than most companies during an economic downturn, though. That’s because it caters to relatively high-income earners who are less likely to lose their jobs during a recession. The company provides credit cards that come with high annual fees. The fact that its members can afford those annual fees, as high as $695, suggests that their spending will be more resilient during recessions. So AXP stock is likely to perform better in the short term than other firms. The long-term outlook of AXP stock is strong as well. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s revenue  to exceed $52 billion in 2022 and rise to $58 billion in 2023. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLast month, those who are bullish on  Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock contended that shoppers were increasingly purchasing food from the grocery chain. Rather than pay for expensive meals at restaurants, they noted,  people were instead shopping at Kroger in order to reduce the amount of money they spend on food. And indeed, that trend was reflected in the firm’s Q2 earnings as its sales jumped 9.15% YOY in Q2 to $34.6 billion. Strong cooking-at-home trends look poised to continue throughout the remainder of 2022 as September’s inflation data tell a grim story. Kroger increased its full-year guidance when it released its Q2 earnings in early September. When the company reports its Q3 results later this year, it’s possible that its guidance could increase again. In any case, the short-term outlook of Kroger’s business is positive. Kroger’s  long-term outlook could be especially positive as KR is planning to buy its smaller rival, Alberstons (NYSE:ACI). The $24.6 billion purchase would create a grocery giant. As a result, if the deal is approved, the newly created company could rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as the largest seller of groceries in the U.S. McKesson Corp. (MCK)Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stockSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett chose another long-term winner in McKesson (NYSE:MCK) stock. Like the other equities on this list, its returns over the last decade have been impressive. Its annualized returns averaged 15.6% over the last decade. Capital invested in MCK stock ten years ago would have more than quadrupled in value. McKesson is a pharmaceutical supply chain management firm. Specifically, the company optimizes the delivery of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products. The demand for these offerings does not vary much based on economic growth. McKesson has built a large network that continues to perform well. In its most recent reported quarter, its revenues increased 7% YOY to $67.15 billion. McKesson was hit by higher costs and its earnings,  excluding some items, slipped 3% YOY. However, it meaningfully increased its full-year EPS guidance due to the government’s spending on coronavirus-related items.Perhaps most importantly for long-term dividend investors, McKesson increased its dividend by 15% from 47 cents to 54 cents per share. DaVita (DVA)A DaVita (DVA) kidney care clinic in St. Joseph, Missouri.Source: APN Photography / Shutterstock.comDaVita (NYSE:DVA) stock hasn’t performed as well as many of the other stocks on this list over the past ten years. Overall, it performed 5% better than the New York Stock Exchange where it is listed. Capital invested in DaVita would have appreciated in value a relatively modest 59% over that period. But the reason to invest in DaVita for the next ten years relates to America’s obesity epidemic. More than 42% of Americans are now obese, the highest rate ever. That means the rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes will continue to increase. DaVita  provides kidney care and dialysis treatments to patients with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is caused by several factors. However, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes are the primary drivers of the disease. Chronic kidney disease is expected to increase over the next decade as America’s obesity epidemic worsens. So the demand for DaVita’s treatments is likely to increase as more and more Americans are diagnosed with the disease. Chevron (CVX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has become somewhat maligned as the U.S. quickly moves away from fossil fuels and toward alternative-energy sources. However, the importance of fossil fuels remains evident. Recently, Americans have again come to understand how our dependence on foreign oil can negatively affect our lives, as average gasoline prices jumped above $5 in June.It isn’t the short-term effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine alone that make CVX stock a buy. More importantly, the U.S. and the world cannot ween themselves off of fossil fuels overnight, and the transition will be much more gradual. As a result, energy companies like Chevron will remain important to the economy, and their stocks will remain good investments  for the next decade. Here’s something to think about: Energy stocks suffered what was termed a lost decade in the 2010s. That said, CVX stock outperformed the market during that period.  It also provides a strong dividend which yields 3.55%. Investors should hold onto CVX stock, reinvest its dividends, and recognize that CVX will remain relevant for a long time. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This compares to earnings of $6.68 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -19.68%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.49 billion.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Whirlpool: unfavorable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Millions of dollars except per share data)(Unaudited)We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as ""ongoing"" measures, including earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), EBIT margin, ongoing EBIT, ongoing EBIT margin, ongoing earnings per diluted share, adjusted effective tax rate, organic net sales, return on invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow. Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that organic net sales provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and divestitures. Management believes that ROIC provides investors with a view of capital efficiency, a key driver of stockholder value creation. Management believes that adjusted tax rate provides investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its forward-looking long-term value creation goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, free cash flow conversion, ROIC and gross debt/EBITDA, as these long-term management goals are not annual guidance, and the reconciliation of these long-term measures would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company's control. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share, net earnings, net earnings available to Whirlpool, net earnings margin, return on assets, net sales, effective tax rate and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also disclose segment EBIT an important financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting. GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share and ongoing earnings per diluted share are presented net of tax, while individual adjustments in each reconciliation are presented on a pre-tax basis; the income tax impact line item aggregates the tax impact for these adjustments. The tax impact of individual line item adjustments may not foot precisely to the aggregate income tax impact amount, as each line item adjustment may include non-taxable components. Historical quarterly earnings per share amounts are presented based on a normalized tax rate adjustment to reconcile quarterly tax rates to full-year tax rate expectations. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.THIRD-QUARTER 2022 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHAREThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool and net earnings (loss) per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net earnings (loss) margin is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool by net sales. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by net sales. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. The earnings per diluted share GAAP measure and ongoing measure are presented net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. Our third-quarter GAAP tax rate was 26.5%. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our third-quarter adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP) of (10.8)%.Three Months EndedEarnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes Reconciliation:September 30, 2022Net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool$                              143Net earnings (loss) available to noncontrolling interests2Income tax expense (benefit)53Interest expense40Earnings before interest &amp; taxes$                              238Net sales$                           4,784Net earnings (loss) margin3.0 % Results classificationEarnings beforeinterest &amp; taxesEarnings perdiluted shareReported measure$                     238$                       2.60Impact of M&amp;A transactions(b)Selling, general &amp;administrative270.49Income tax impact0.05Normalized tax rate adjustment(c)1.35Ongoing measure$                     265$                       4.49Net sales$                 4,784Ongoing EBIT margin5.5 %Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding THIRD-QUARTER 2021 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings available to Whirlpool and net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Net earnings margin is calculated by dividing net earnings available to Whirlpool by net sales. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by net sales. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. The earnings per diluted share GAAP measure and ongoing measure are presented net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. Our third-quarter GAAP tax rate was 17.1%.

Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by net sales. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. The earnings per diluted share GAAP measure and ongoing measure are presented net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. Our anticipated full-year GAAP tax rate is 31.0% to 33.0%. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated full-year adjusted tax (non-GAAP) rate between 14.0% and 16.0%.Twelve Months EndingDecember 31, 2022Results classificationEarnings beforeinterest &amp; taxes*Earnings per diluted shareReported measure$                        603~$5.00Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles(a)Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles3846.83Impact of M&amp;A transactions(b)Selling, general &amp; administrative4698.33Total income tax impact(2.27)Normalized tax rate adjustment(c)1.25Ongoing measure$                     1,456~$19.00Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding*Earnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) is a non-GAAP measure. The Company does not provide a forward-looking quantitative reconciliation of EBIT to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net earnings available to Whirlpool, because the net earnings available to noncontrolling interests item of such reconciliation -- which has historically represented a relatively insignificant amount of the Company's overall net earnings -- implicates the Company's projections regarding the earnings of the Company's non wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that cannot be quantified precisely or without unreasonable efforts. FOOTNOTESa. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES - The carrying value of the EMEA reporting unit and Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks exceeded their fair values resulting in an impairment charge of $384 million during the second quarter of 2022.b. IMPACT OF M&amp;A TRANSACTIONS - During the second quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Russia business. We classified this disposal group as held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $346 million for the write-down of the assets to their fair value. During the third quarter of 2022, the loss from disposal was adjusted by an immaterial amount resulting in a final loss amount of $348 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, we incurred unique transaction related costs of $25 million related to portfolio transformation and EMEA strategic assessment expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and $42 million for the nine months ended, respectively, and expect to incur additional charges in the three months ending December 31, 2022. These transaction costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).c. NORMALIZED TAX RATE ADJUSTMENT -  During the third quarter of 2022, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of (10.8)% to reconcile to our anticipated full-year ongoing effective tax rate between 14.0% and 16.0%, which excludes the impacts of the non-tax deductible loss on sale of the Russia business of $348 million and impairment of goodwill of $278 million. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 25.0%, to reconcile to our anticipated full-year 2021 ongoing effective tax rate between 24% and 26%, which excludes the gain on sale and disposal of businesses.d. RESTRUCTURING COSTS - In 2022, and moving forward, we will only exclude restructuring actions greater than $50 million from our ongoing results. In 2021, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our EMEA business and other centralized functions.e. (GAIN) LOSS ON SALE AND DISPOSAL OF BUSINESSES -  During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $13 million loss related to the sale of our Turkish subsidiary.f. (GAIN) LOSS ON PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INTEREST - During the third quarter of 2021, Whirlpool Corporation acquired an additional 38% equity interest in Elica PB India Private Limited (Elica PB India) for $57 million, which resulted in a controlling equity ownership of approximately 87%. The previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India was remeasured at fair value of $74 million on the acquisition date, which resulted in a gain of $42 million. This gain was recorded within Interest &amp; sundry (income) expense during the third quarter. The earnings per diluted share impact is calculated net of minority interest. ORGANIC NET SALESThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure organic net sales to GAAP reported net sales, for three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022 for the Whirlpool EMEA business.Three Months EndedSept 30,20212022ChangeNet Sales $           1,256$               903(28.1) %Less: Russia Divestiture14624Less: Currency(142)Organic Net Sales$           1,110$           1,021(8.0) %Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow is cash provided by (used in) operating activities after capital expenditures.

The company's 5‑year historical average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio is 11.6 percentage points for the third quarter.Cincinnati Financial Corporation logo. (PRNewsFoto/Cincinnati Financial Corporation) (PRNewsFoto/CINCINNATI FINANCIAL CORPORATION)The catastrophe loss estimate includes $220 million from Hurricane Ian, excluding any effects of reinstatement premiums assumed or ceded, in addition to less severe storms. Losses estimated for Hurricane Ian as of September 30, 2022, did not reach a level applicable to Cincinnati Insurance's property catastrophe treaty or Cincinnati Re's property catastrophe excess of loss coverage as both reinsurance arrangements include retention of the first $100 million of any loss. The estimate for total third-quarter 2022 catastrophe losses incurred includes approximately $46 million for the commercial lines insurance segment; $69 million for the personal lines insurance segment; $112 million for Cincinnati Re® and $25 million for Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltdsm.Steven J. Johnston, chairman and CEO, commented: ""Our hearts go out to all those who found themselves in the path of Hurricane Ian. We have deployed storm teams – made up of our own associates who volunteer to serve extra during catastrophes so that we can quickly begin the restoration process for our policyholders. This is when our claims associates shine, delivering fast, fair and empathetic service.""So far this year we've seen a variety of challenges – inflation, declining stock and bond markets and a Category 4 hurricane – reinforcing our belief in the importance of maintaining our long-term focus. Our solid financial position ensures our ability to continue executing on our strategic initiatives, growing our agency plant, introducing diversifying products and investing in our talented associates.""Story continuesEstimated losses and expenses from catastrophe-related claims are expected to bring the company's third-quarter 2022 property casualty combined ratio to approximately 104%. The combined ratio before catastrophe losses continues to reflect increased uncertainty of estimated ultimate losses, due in part to elevated paid losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation. Net written premium growth is estimated to be approximately 14% for the quarter.Declining stock markets drove third-quarter 2022 earnings to a net loss estimated to be between $2.61 and $2.67 per share, with non-GAAP operating income ranging from $0.70 to $0.76 on a per share basis. To reconcile net income to operating income, net investment gains and losses on an after-tax basis is removed.The unaudited loss estimates and other data presented in this release is preliminary, based upon management estimates and subject to the completion of the company's procedures for the preparation of its quarterly financial statements. As a result, further adjustments may be made between now and the time financial results for the quarter are finalized.Cincinnati Financial plans to report final results for third-quarter 2022 on Monday, October 31, after the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. A conference call to discuss the results will be held at 11 a.m. ET on Tuesday, November 1, with a live, audio-only internet broadcast available at cinfin.com/investors.About Cincinnati FinancialCincinnati Financial Corporation offers primarily business, home and auto insurance through The Cincinnati Insurance Company and its two standard market property casualty companies.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.Coming into today, shares of the industrial conglomerate had gained 8.14% in the past month. In that same time, the Conglomerates sector lost 3.24%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.13%.Investors will be hoping for strength from General Electric as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. In that report, analysts expect General Electric to post earnings of $0.47 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.54%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $19.04 billion, up 3.29% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.69 per share and revenue of $75.77 billion, which would represent changes of +26.89% and +2.22%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

445,6a95c4a4-ad3f-35e4-9380-61951d15464d,GE,2022-10-21,Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/honeywell-international-inc-hon-earnings-140202523.html,1666274522,STORY,"['HON', 'GE']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Honeywell International Inc. (HON) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.9%.Revenues are expected to be $9.06 billion, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Honeywell International Inc.For Honeywell International Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Honeywell International Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Honeywell International Inc. Would post earnings of $2.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.10, delivering a surprise of +3.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Honeywell International Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerGeneral Electric (GE), another stock in the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.47 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -17.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $19.04 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for GE has been revised 1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -9.45%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that GE will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We expect estimates to move south once analysts start incorporating loss estimates into their numbers.About 30% of this loss, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, will be absorbed by the property and casualty Insurance segment and the remaining 70% will be absorbed by the Reinsurance segment.Swiss Re estimates claims stemming from Hurricane Ian in the range of $50 billion to $65 billion. The Progressive Corporation PGR incurred $760 million of catastrophe losses due to Hurricane Ian in the third quarter of 2022 that weighed on its quarterly results.  The Travelers Companies Inc.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +17.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.78 per share, indicating a change of +455.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.24 points to a change of +833.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.71 indicates a change of -28.7% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $39.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +32.2%. The $173.73 billion and $157.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +52.4% and -9.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $51.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +86.1%. EPS of $11.36 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +27.09%. The EPS surprise was +17.11%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters, with the average surprise being 33.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseValero Energy Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseValero Energy Corporation price-eps-surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $6.78 has witnessed one upward and four downward revisions over the past 30 days. The estimated figure suggests a 455.7% improvement from the prior-year reported number.The consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues of $39 billion indicates a 32.2% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to ConsiderGasoline price was much higher in the third quarter than a year ago, thanks to demand recovery. In fact, refining capacity for processing oil into end products like gasoline was not sufficient to support handsome fuel demand, thereby leading to elevated fuel prices. Hence, Valero Energy, having 15 refineries with a throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day, is likely to have benefited from improved fuel prices.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero Energy’s operating income from the refining business is pegged at $3,813 million, suggesting an improvement from $835 million reported in the third quarter of 2021.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate an earnings beat for Valero Energy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Quickly Is UnitedHealth Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. UnitedHealth Group managed to grow EPS by 14% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. UnitedHealth Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$315b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for UnitedHealth Group.Story continuesAre UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of UnitedHealth Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.7b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add UnitedHealth Group To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you should know about.Although UnitedHealth Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

453,9e1c61af-aedc-3492-8baa-e5dd3afe8659,LKQ,2022-10-21,LKQ (LKQ) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lkq-lkq-expected-beat-earnings-140102171.html,1666274462,STORY,['LKQ'],"[The market expects LKQ (LKQ) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis vehicle components company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.9%.Revenues are expected to be $3.21 billion, down 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LKQ?For LKQ, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that LKQ will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that LKQ would post earnings of $1.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of +6.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.LKQ appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The high inflation and rising interest rate environment has caused consumer sentiment to slow down, and many companies are missing earnings estimates. However, some of the classic recession-proof stocks have recently performed strongly in the third quarter. Let's dive in to two of my favorites:Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).PG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PGPeter Lynch Chart of PG1. Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a blue chip consumer packaged goods company that produces a variety of household products. These include everything from shampoo to shaving products, laundry detergent and even toilet paper. This is truly a recession-proof stock as whether the economic situation is good or bad, people will need to buy these items.During the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, there was even a huge surge in the number of people buying and hoarding toilet paper out of fear that it may run out.The company operates in over 70 countries globally and has a strong market share in many of them.Strong earnings Procter &amp; Gamble recently announced strong financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2023. Revenue was a staggering $20.6 billion, which increased by 7% year over year and beat analyst estimates of 5.5% growth (according to Capital IQ data). This growth was mainly driven by price increases for its products and a favorable product sales mix, despite a 3% decline in overall organic sales volume. The company did experience a 6% headwind against revenue from the strong dollar, but this is excluded from the revenue data stated previously.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsThe company generated strong earnings per share of $1.57, which popped by almost 30% sequentially and beat analyst expectations by 1.3%. Procter &amp; Gamble also generated a solid operating margin of 24%, which increased by 30 basis points year over year. Procter &amp; Gamble increased its operational efficiency in the first quarter, which contributed to over 2.3% in margin improvement.Story continuesThe company has $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet compared to long term debt of $36.6 billion, but this is not a surprise or major issue for such a mature company with consistent cash flow.Procter &amp; Gamble pays a forward dividend yield of 2.82%, which has grown consistently for over 66 years.ValuationProcter &amp; Gamble has a price-earnings ratio of 22, which is 4% cheaper than its five-year average. The price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is 17, which is 9% cheaper than its five-year average.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsThe GF Value chart indicates a fair value of $150 per share, thus the stock is modestly undervalued at the time of writing.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten Earnings2. Johnson &amp; JohnsonJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a blue chip health care products company which operates across four main segments: Consumer Health, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals and Vision. Its Consumer Health segment includes a variety of popular brands such as Tylenol, Neutrogena, Aveeno and more. Its Pharmaceuticals division includes cardiovascular disease treatments and even a Covid-19 vaccine.Strong earnings Johnson &amp; Johnson generated strong financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Revenue was $23.79 billion, which beat analyst consensus estimates by $357.6 million. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, global revenue increased by 8.2% year over year. This was driven primarily by the pharmaceutical segment, which generated $13.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% operationally. The second largest segment was Medical Devices, which generated $6.8 billion in sales, up 8.1% operationally year over year. The smallest segment, Consumer Health, generated $3.8 billion in revenue, which increased by 4.7% year over year.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsIn the third quarter, net income increased to $4.5 billion, up a rapid 21.6% from the $3.7 billion generated in the equivalent quarter last year. Earnings per share also popped to $1.68, up 22.6% from the equivalent quarter last year. The company generated solid free cash flow of approximately $13 billion.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a solid balance sheet with $34 billion in cash and marketable securities in addition to $32 billion in total debt, which leaves a net cash position of $2 billion. Moving forward, management plans to execute its capital allocation strategy of mergers and acquisitions while returning cash to shareholders with buybacks and dividends. The company has a forward dividend yield of 2.74%, which has grown consistently over the past 59 years.ValuationJohnson &amp; Johnson has a price-earnings ratio of 6.4, which is 10% cheaper than the health care sector mean. In addition, this is 3% cheaper than its five-year average price-earnings ratio.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsThe GF Value chart also indicates a fair value of $175 per share, thus the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing.2 Recession-Proof Stocks That Have Recently Beaten EarningsFinal thoughts Procter &amp; Gamble and Johnson &amp; Johnson are two defensive stocks that are fairly recession-proof. Each of their business models is focused on non-discretionary consumer household goods. The dividend yields make these stocks popular with income investors as the consistency is solid.

Before he had-- the company, though, he was a recent college grad working at Procter &amp; Gamble. The road of his career caught the attention of our Brian Sozzi. And that's where we find his take today. Brians got to stick together. Is that what it is?BRIAN SOZZI: Something like that. You see me sleuthing. I'm still going over all the transcripts from our All Markets Summit earlier in this week, just trying to pick up things that maybe I missed that investors should know about these leaders. I happen to think it is very important that investors know about the people leading the companies that they are invested in. But Brian Niccol, believe it or not, started working at Procter &amp; Gamble on Scope mouthwash. Hear his story.BRIAN NICCOL: You never really know where your journey is going to go. But I was very fortunate to get my first job at Procter &amp; Gamble. I got to work with a lot of great people. They took the time to invest in me so that I became, I think, much better at marketing and general management skills. And I've taken that with me down the road.And here I am at Chipotle. One thing I did discover while I was at P&amp;G, had the opportunity to work on Pringles, is, I loved working in the space of food. And it just resonated with me. And so fast forward. Here we are today. I still strongly encourage you to use Scope mouthwash, but obviously, I'm a much bigger fan of guacamole and burritos these days.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, no, just an interesting there, little nugget. And my experience has been, just talking to a lot of many leaders for many years, Procter &amp; Gamble and PepsiCo, they just churn out a ton of top executives. There's just something about those processes at those older companies, whether it's in the-- how they teach marketing, how they teach leadership. I can't tell you how many people get poached from those organizations to work at mid-level positions and then ultimately end up in a CEO job like Brian Niccol.Story continuesAnd I look at two names, two people that I've gotten to know through the years, that's Chip Bergh, the CEO of Levi's. He started-- he created the Swiffer, which-- the Swiffer device over at Procter &amp; Gamble. Then Clorox CEO Benno Dora-- or former CEO, I should say, he worked at Procter &amp; Gamble as well. And he ended up at Clorox. It's just interesting to see the journey for a lot of these executives.But my take here is that it is very important as an investor. Do a search on the internet. See how these company leaders grew up, where have they worked, what have they done. Pull up their LinkedIn profile, and the information is right there. Start putting two and two together. I think it will go a long way to explain why companies are doing good and then why companies may be doing bad.BRAD SMITH: That's really encouraging, especially for a person like myself, whose background was in marketing before getting more into kind of the sales side and the integration. And of course, they go one and the same in one facet or another. But hearing that about Brian Niccol and the CPG side of his background, too, really gives you some insight into how he thinks about the behavioral construct of the consumer and how that's ever changing and what he's navigating Chipotle through with that, too, now.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and it's no disrespect to Chipotle. This is a restaurant operation increasingly becoming global, over 3,000 restaurants. But when you work on a global brand like a Pringles and have those complicated operations, that is incredible experience to ultimately take over. And for him, he went to Yum Brands, spent many years at Yum Brands, created the Live Más slogan while at Taco Bell, ultimately using all those skills that he learned at Procter &amp; Gamble. And now he's putting it all to play over at Chipotle.BRAD SMITH: Really remarkable. All right, well, I ordered one of the burritos just-- well, the burrito bowl influenced by, of course, Brian Sozzi and Brooke DiPalma.JULIE HYMAN: You only got one, though.BRAD SMITH: I only got-- but I doubled the meat.BRIAN SOZZI: I just got two.BRAD SMITH: I did double the meat, yes.JULIE HYMAN: Ah, OK. All right. By the way, Brad remembered he does have his own Netflix account.BRAD SMITH: This is true.JULIE HYMAN: Update, update on a story we were just discussing.BRAD SMITH: I'm in the financials, folks.BRIAN SOZZI: And you're paying for it.BRAD SMITH: Big time.]"

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.UDR (UDR) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this real estate investment trust is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for UDR is 2.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, UDR has an S/TA ratio of 0.13, which means that the company gets $0.13 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.12, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And UDR is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 16.5% this year versus the industry average of 11.2%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for UDR have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineUDR has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that UDR is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAA — commonly known as MAA — is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 26 after market close. MAA’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.The Germantown, TN-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 1.00% in terms of FFO per share in the last reported quarter. This residential REIT’s quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 2.32%. This is depicted in the chart below:MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MidAmerica Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. Rather, the pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture the recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. In the third quarter, MAA is expected to have experienced strong rent growth and stable occupancy, thereby driving revenue growth.MAA also continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $506.2 million, suggesting an 11.8% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Same-store revenues are projected at $486.95 million, indicating an increase from the $472.16 million reported in the prior quarter and $434.0 million in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for physical occupancy is presently pegged at 96.2% for the third quarter, up from 95.7% in the prior quarter.The consensus estimate for the third-quarter same-store net operating income is currently pegged at $308.08 million, up from $300.24 in the prior quarter and $269.39 in the year-ago period.MAA projected the third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share in the band of $1.99-$2.15, with $2.07 at the midpoint.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised three cents upward to $2.09 in the past three months. This also suggests year-over-year growth of 17.4%.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.31%.

Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) recent 4.9% drop adds to one-year losses",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-150646948.html,1666278406,STORY,['DHI'],"[Every investor in D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 4.9% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 23% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell D.R. Horton, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about D.R. Horton. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About D.R. Horton?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in D.R. Horton. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see D.R. Horton's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. D.R. Horton is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 12%. With 10% and 8.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of D.R. HortonThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that D.R. Horton, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$116m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over D.R. Horton. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand D.R. Horton better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  D.R. Horton is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those shouldn't be ignored...If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To combat the surging inflation in the country, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year.  The core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) increased 6.6% year over year in September compared with 6.5% in August.As a result of this high reading, the Fed, which has already raised its core interest rate of 3% year to date, is likely to continue its interest-raising policy. Higher interest rates flare up the cost of borrowing, thus increasing the possibility of an economic slowdown.This gloomy scenario and the uncertain path ahead are well reflected in the double-digit year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes. Despite the current turmoil, turning one’s back on equities is never advisable. So what’s the way forward?One way is to adhere to broker advice. Broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, CVR Energy CVI, Bunge Limited BG and Cardinal Health CAH are worth having a look at for healthy returns.Why Broker Advice is the Need of the HourIn the absence of proper guidance, individual investors may end up selecting wrong stocks for their portfolio. This might waste their hard-earned money, which they invested in the stock markets.As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to much detailed information on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain. After thorough research, brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock. Naturally, individual investors should avail of brokers’ handy tips while designing a winning basket of stocks.Winning StrategyThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and northward revisions of earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Story continuesAlso, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is included. The price/sales ratio takes care of a company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 10.9% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by the uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). High fuel costs are, however, a bane.Delta’s earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining two quarters). The average beat is 7.9%.CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit is supporting growth.CVR Energy, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

You'd think the stock is soaring on spectacular Q3 earnings, right? Well, not so much. American is the latest domestic airline, though, to report a very strong quarter, beating expectations, seeing revenue surge 50% to $13.46 billion. Their CFO Derek Kerr saying-- and we've heard this from all of them-- we currently see no signs of demand slowing. We heard that from United. We heard it from Delta.American expects Q4 revenue 11% to 13% higher than the same period in 2019, with slower than planned aircraft deliveries and a shortage of regional pilots. Potentially, the downside here hampering growth a bit. Their CEO, Robert Isom, said the pilot shortage could take three years to resolve. That is a massive problem across all the domestics. Perhaps that or a buy the rumor, sell the news situation, why the stock is actually down about 4% today, shockingly, and 28% year to date.One further note I want to discuss with you, Josh, international first class-- they plan to drop it. They say no one is buying it, which is fascinating because we're seeing on the high end of luxury spending, there's been no demand destruction. Surprise-- they're going to replace it with all business.JOSH SCHAFER: I'm very surprised by that. Every other company you look at, right, it seems like it's a trade-up environment when it's high-end. When we're talking high-end goods, people are trading up. So interesting to see them cut that. I don't know, Seana. I don't know if I want to fly all the way to Europe in business class, right?SEANA SMITH: But, you know-- but they still have the [INAUDIBLE]. Wow, I didn't know that you were such a bougie traveler here.[INTERPOSING VOICES]You are somebody here every day on set. But I think it is important to point out why they are doing this. They were saying that they simply just did not see the demand from the customers. People weren't willing to pay up for that first class seat, so they're going to replace it with business class, which people seem to be much more willing to pay for, obviously, because it's a little bit cheaper. It still is going to cost you a lot. So if you're not willing to go into coach, I think it's going to be costing you quite a bit on your next trip.Story continuesIt is interesting, though, to see the stock react the way it is today, Dave. It's hard to make sense of it. I think maybe it rose after we saw the strong results from Delta and United over the past week and a half. So now that maybe some of the excitement has already been baked into the stock, which is why we're seeing that 3 and 1/2% dip today. But the demand--DAVE BRIGGS: That's my only theory.SEANA SMITH: --very, very strong.DAVE BRIGGS: This report is strong top to bottom, as its forecast.SEANA SMITH: It is very strong, yes. It's kind of unbelievable when you look at the strength there of a lot of the airlines this quarter.]"

If you want to read about some more counter cyclical stocks, go directly to 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.The United States economy is hurtling towards a recession as a hawkish Federal Reserve continues to stomp down on inflation with aggressive rate hikes. In this macro environment, the benchmark indexes of the stock market, like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are all trading at new lows as investors take money out of stocks and pile into more value-friendly assets. The three indexes are down an alarming 22%, 32%, and 16% year-to-date as of October 20, respectively. In this macro environment, investors with growth-heavy portfolios are eagerly seeking out stocks which perform well during economic downturns and slowdowns. These counter cyclical stocks, unlike cyclical options like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), tend to perform well during recessions. For example, during a recession, sales of alcoholic beverages and fast food items increase as people seek to ward off depression and anxiety amid job cuts and inflation. Similarly, there is a general bias in favor of auto part firms during slowdowns as people are more likely to buy used cars or repair existing vehicles instead of buying new cars at inflated rates. Discount retailers also witness an uptick in activity during slowdowns. The sales of tobacco companies increase as well. Several top economists, including Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, have forecast a recession in the US in 2023, advising investors to prepare for the upcoming storm through investments in counter cyclical firms. Our MethodologyThe companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowImage by MayoFi from PixabayBest Counter Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now10. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22     Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On July 5, Vita Coco, a beverage company, and Diageo plc announced that they are collaborating to launch a line of premium canned cocktails crafted with a blend of Captain Morgan rum and Vita Coco coconut water. The line is expected to be in the market by 2023.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 22 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $887.4 million in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 21 the preceding quarter worth $836.7 million.Just like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Home Depot, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”9.

480,e03f54cb-42f8-361a-9a82-2b1849a7045f,PFG,2022-10-21,Principal Financial (PFG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-pfg-expected-beat-140202008.html,1666274522,STORY,"['PFG', 'AMP']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Principal Financial (PFG) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.06 billion, down 15.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.88% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Principal Financial?For Principal Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Principal Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Principal Financial would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.65, delivering a surprise of +18.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Principal Financial appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), is soon expected to post earnings of $5.82 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.42 billion, down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Ameriprise has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.42%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the past 15 years ending August 2022, the average dividend growth rate was recorded at 13.71%, compared with a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”7.

THC.Industry: HospitalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1994814/4-stocks-navigating-through-hospital-industry-headwindsThe hospital space is currently fighting labor shortage, inflation and resultant escalated operating expenses. Even though revenues are increasing, growing salaries and benefits are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players’ margins. Surplus supply and stiff competition are other major headwinds. However, the resumption of non-essential procedures stimulated a recovery in patient volumes.Rising outpatient surgeries and patient days are boosting hospital players’ operations. Also, technological improvements and adoptions are lowering hospitals' treatment costs. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc., Universal Health Services Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. are set to benefit from these developments.About the IndustryThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care, and diagnostic and emergency services, among others.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Trends Deciding the Industry's FateRising Costs: Hospital companies are facing high salaries, wages and benefits, and increasing operating expenses due to inflation, which are eroding margins. Investments in growth projects will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Also, the renegotiation of contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Recovering Volumes: Demand for elective procedures will likely drive patient volumes as the intensity of COVID-related headwinds keeps decreasing. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. Nonetheless, financial constraints are forcing patients to delay addressing non-emergency medical needs, as found in a survey by Discover Financial, which can be a major headwind. Discover Financial stated that 31% of Americans with medical debt are holding back doctor-recommended treatments.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are enabling the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau’s revised report suggests that individuals aged above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that are utilized by hospitals. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients’ waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

(PEP) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pepsico-inc-130001179.html,1666270801,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%. This estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +7.6% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.63 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $84.91 billion and $87.57 billion estimates indicate +6.8% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The investments are designed to ""de-risk"" promising initiatives while accelerating the development of innovative technologies and approaches that can help scale the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.In 2022, the PAO Fund is making investments in projects that span a range of commodities, supply chains, time horizons and PepsiCo business units, but all are focused on either testing a new regenerative technology or approach, helping farmers build climate resilience, or developing new sustainable ""landscapes[1]."" Across 2021 and 2022, the PAO Fund catalyzed PepsiCo investments in over 20 different projects, estimated to total more than $27 million through 2026.""With support from the PAO Fund, we've been able to generate much greater engagement and innovation both at the farm level and through closer collaboration with our global teams,"" said Haseeb Malik, Senior Manager of Agriculture AMESA, PepsiCo.

495,0117e454-8e0b-31e2-a9be-4c5138bcafa1,REGN,2022-10-21,Regeneron Receives Six Months of U.S. Pediatric Exclusivity for EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-receives-six-months-u-110000358.html,1666350000,STORY,['REGN'],"[TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted pediatric exclusivity for EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection. This grant extends the period of U.S. market exclusivity for EYLEA by an additional six months through May 17, 2024.The pediatric exclusivity determination is based on data from two Phase 3 trials – BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE – which were submitted in response to the FDA's Written Request to evaluate the use of EYLEA as a treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. The two Phase 3 trials also formed the basis of a supplemental Biologics License Application for EYLEA in ROP that was recently accepted for Priority Review by the FDA. The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for BUTTERFLEYE and Bayer for FIREFLEYE.EYLEA was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ROP in July 2019. The safety and efficacy of EYLEA for this indication have not been fully evaluated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.EYLEA is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.About EYLEAEYLEA is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye. It is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels (vascular permeability) in the eye by blocking VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PLGF), two growth factors involved in angiogenesis. The EYLEA safety and efficacy profile is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 10 years of real-world experience and more than 50 million EYLEA injections globally.Bayer and Regeneron are collaborating on the global development of EYLEA. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights of EYLEA in the United States. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA.Story continuesIMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

They are pushing lower, down more than 4%, after the railroad operator reported third quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates. But it cut its outlook for carload growth and stock repurchases. Joining us now to discuss the results, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz. Lance, it's always good to have you on.Taking a look at the quarter here, it's certainly look like increased pricing, as well as fuel surcharges, certainly helped drive revenue higher. But looking at the stock reaction today, investors concerned about those operational efficiencies that you sort of flagged, along with the inflationary pressures. How much of that have you seen accelerate in this quarter?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, Akiko, thank you for hosting me this morning. The quarter was a bit noisy. The fundamental story is, we made sequential improvement from second quarter to third quarter in terms of fluidity of the network and operation inefficiencies. And as we exit and head into the fourth quarter, that continues. And so we're continuing to recover the network from where we were in the middle of the second quarter. And I anticipate back to normal in the fourth quarter. That's been our story all along.We showed that progress. Perhaps not as much progress as we had anticipated, but real progress, nevertheless. Inside of that, to your point, we had solid pricing gains, good fuel surcharge, recovery, and overall, the financials were strong, right? Record EPS, net income, operating income, freight revenue.But at the same time, we did say that the heat's coming out of the marketplace. The guidance that we gave at the beginning of the third quarter about what we thought volume would look like in the back half, we had to trim down because volume's cooling off a bit across a number of our markets. And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that, where you're seeing the pullback in volume and where are the biggest headwinds for you right now.LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad, that tends to be domestic, intermodal, parcel, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services-- not all the way back. You recall, there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic.So it hasn't gone all the way back. But at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less. And you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the West Coast ports, and you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad.There are some markets, though, where we're seeing strong demand, and it's not going away-- things like coal, some of the bulk commodities, grain, rock, and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year over year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would.AKIKO FUJITA: Lance, last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing. And I saw the number here in your quarter, $114 million charge related to labor agreements. How comfortable are you with where things stand right now on that front?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the BMWER maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified. We've got five in the ratification vote. And we've got more work to do now with the BMWED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason.The PB, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees, they also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance away, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location and the per diem we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract.So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMWE to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be-- or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome.AKIKO FUJITA: So end of the year is still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snags that you've had?LANCE FRITZ: Yeah, I am. I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for a vote.AKIKO FUJITA: Lance, it's always great to have you on the show. Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz.

That's still a possibility, but I don't think it's a probability,"" CEO Lance Fritz said on a post-earnings call on Thursday.The comments by the CEO of the largest U.S. railroad by market value, with some 30,000 employees, come as members of a major union voted earlier this month to reject a deal that was brokered by President Joe Biden between U.S. railroads and unions.A rail shutdown may freeze almost 30% of U.S. cargo shipment by weight, stoke inflation and cost the American economy as much as $2 billion per day.So far, six unions have ratified the tentative contract, which provides for significant wage increases, but sticking points remain over issues such as working conditions and time-off for sickness.Five unions are set to vote in the coming weeks over the new contract, which was agreed upon after more than two years of talks.After members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (BMWED) rejected the contract earlier this month, the committee representing U.S. railroads on Wednesday rejected a new contract proposal from BMWED.""The PEB's (Presidential Emergency Board) recommendations remain the framework for an agreement,"" said the National Carriers' Conference Committee, which represents rails including Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX Corp, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern.The BMWED did not respond to a request for comment.Union Pacific shares were down 4.1% after the company cut its volume forecast for the year on labor shortage and softening demand.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Union Pacific in FocusBased in Omaha, Union Pacific (UNP) is in the Transportation sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -20.59%. The railroad is paying out a dividend of $1.3 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.6% compared to the Transportation - Rail industry's yield of 1.37% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.79%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.20 is up 21.2% from last year. Union Pacific has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12.93%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Union Pacific's payout ratio is 48%, which means it paid out 48% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNP is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $11.57 per share, with earnings expected to increase 16.28% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNP is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We have Quest Diagnostics, Caesars Entertainment, and American Airlines. Also, Josh Hafer joining us here to play in this one. So my play today is Quest Diagnostics. It's one of the top performers in the S&amp;P. Today's jump is the biggest daily gain that we've seen in the stock in about a year and a half. Now, the move higher coming after the company lifted the lower end of its full year earnings guidance.Quest's 5% growth in its base business helped mitigate some of those concerns out there after the slowdown that we saw in its softer second quarter. With today's beat, Quest it looks like it will be exiting the pandemic in a stronger position now. Baird analyst Eric Coldwell writing in a note to clients that the company's base business is, quote, ""looking good."" Citi highlighting that business is picking up in August and September, which of course would bode well in the current quarter-- the fourth quarter-- and as we head into the new year.And Josh, I bring this play up because so many people were thinking that Quest Diagnostics simply would not be able to hold the momentum that we saw during the pandemic, that it was strictly a pandemic play because of the role that they played in COVID testing. But these strong results from their base business, they're really showing that, they will be around to stay, and they could be a power player in this space.JOSH HAFER: Absolutely. And it's a stock the Street hasn't really loved, either. Seven buys, 10 holds on the stock. It's not a stock that many analysts have been bullish on. So I think the earnings were very important for that case. And one other thing that was interesting from the call that I wanted to point out-- Hurricane Ian impacting the company. The company specifically said that they had all time testing-- all time highs in Florida, and then they saw a drag about $0.05 on their adjusted earnings because of Hurricane Ian and the slowdown in testing. Something that I thought was interesting, and we'll probably see from some other companies, that also--- Yeah, that's a good point.JOSH HAFER: --are high volume in Florida.]"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Quest Diagnostics:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Quest Diagnostics has an ROCE of 18%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Healthcare industry. View our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics roceIn the above chart we have measured Quest Diagnostics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Quest Diagnostics here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Quest Diagnostics. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 18%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 27%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.In Conclusion...A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Quest Diagnostics has. Since the stock has returned a solid 49% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesLike most companies, Quest Diagnostics does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This company, which is in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This financial services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1.12%.For the last reported quarter, Ameriprise came out with earnings of $5.81 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 per share, representing a surprise of 1.40%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.93 per share and it actually produced earnings of $5.98 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.84%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ameriprise lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesAmeriprise has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 25, 2022.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

513,e03f54cb-42f8-361a-9a82-2b1849a7045f,AMP,2022-10-21,Principal Financial (PFG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-pfg-expected-beat-140202008.html,1666274522,STORY,"['PFG', 'AMP']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Principal Financial (PFG) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.06 billion, down 15.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.88% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Principal Financial?For Principal Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Principal Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Principal Financial would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.65, delivering a surprise of +18.71%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Principal Financial appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), is soon expected to post earnings of $5.82 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.42 billion, down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Ameriprise has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.42%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $13.32 billion, up 3.28% from the year-ago period.CSCO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.53 per share and revenue of $54.08 billion.

With our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All as our north star, we embarked on a remarkable journey that has brought us to where we are today.This September marks our two-year milestone since establishing Cisco's Social Justice Beliefs and Actions backed by a 5-year $300 million commitment. Our actions are company-wide global priorities designed to drive lasting, systemic, and generational change for the African American and Black (AA/B) community, and our beliefs were designed to serve as a blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for all communities.Growing up in South Africa, I am keenly aware of the many challenges facing historically marginalized communities. Capitalizing on my time spent as General Manager of Sub-Saharan Africa, I embraced the opportunity to stand up Cisco's Action Office when I was offered the role.An Agile Team of ExpertsTo ensure our Social Justice Actions make a lasting impact we knew we needed to establish clear goals, develop performance indicators, and continuously monitor our progress throughout our journey. We needed to be agile and pivot quickly as we encountered new challenges and opportunities along the way.In 2021 we established an Action Office to provide strategic oversight, and operational rigor across all 12 actions. It is an agile team that convenes subject matter experts and facilitates collaboration across our entire ecosystem of employees, partners, customers, and suppliers. Today, the Action Office collaborates with hundreds of people across every business function of the company to lend their unique expertise and perspectives to this important work. The Action Office provides support and keeps the teams on track.Story continues""To ensure our Social Justice Actions make a lasting impact we knew we needed to establish clear goals, develop performance indicators, and continuously monitor our progress throughout our journey.""Our progressWhile we are still early in our 5-year journey, I am proud of the progress we have made. These are the 12 Actions we are taking and some of our achievements through FY22:Supporting policy change: Invested millions of dollars donated by Cisco and employees to nonprofits and social-justice initiatives.Increasing representation: Achieved a 60% increase in AA/B employees in entry level through manager roles, a 94% increase in AA/B directors, and a 160% increase in AA/B vice presidents and above.Paying everyone fairly: Expanded our pay fairness program to include bonus and stock fairness analysis for gender globally and by ethnicity in the US.Making our board more diverse: Welcomed John D. Harris II and Marianna Tessel to our Board of Directors and increased the number of AA/B candidates and full spectrum diversity in our Board and executive leadership pipelines.Completing anti-discrimination training: 91% of our employees have completed Building Skills for a Conscious Culture Training and we are making the training available to Cisco partners and suppliers.Connecting leaders and employees: 100% of our vice presidents have pledged to sponsor an employee via The Multiplier Effect (TME) and we are making TME available to Cisco partners and suppliers. Diversifying our suppliers: Increased spend with diverse suppliers by 27%.Committing $150 million to Black Colleges and Universities: Committed $50 million to establish Student Freedom Initiative 's ""Access to Education"" endowment, of which $25 million has been spent, and committed $100 million to fund critical technology upgrades at HBCUs of which $23.5 million has been spent.Supporting Black-owned companies: Expanded our 0% and 6 month finance offer for HBCUs to Black-owned businesses and provided financial services training to AA/B owned Cisco channel partners.Diversifying our partners: Starting with one well known Black owned partner, we continued to expand and invest in our entire base of AA/B owned partners with a special focus on 14 Acceleration partners.Investing in Black innovators: Provided millions in funding to venture funds and startups led by founders and CEOs who are AA/Black Hispanic/Latinx, Asian and women.Integrating human rights into tech: Established our Human Rights Advisory Committee to promote and champion human rights across Cisco and refine our business and human-rights strategy.Expanding our ImpactCisco's Social justice commitments go well beyond our 12 Actions. Cisco's Inclusive Communities also play a critical role in driving social justice. This past year, they transformed Cisco's annual Social Justice week which is anchored around the United Nations' World Social Justice Day each February, into a year-round Social Justice Movement.In June, Cisco participated in the Global Intellect Summit in New York City sponsored by a member of our African American Cisco Partner Community (AACPC), Overland Tandberg. As part of our sponsorship, we had the opportunity to showcase a video highlighting our Social Justice Actions on the big screen in Times Square.Earlier this month we committed $5 million to the Black Economic Alliance Foundation (BEA Foundation), a national nonprofit organization that promotes generational wealth-building for the Black community. The commitment includes over $4 million in grants and direct technical services toward the development of the Center for Black Entrepreneurship (CBE) and $1 million towards the BEA Entrepreneurs Fund . The commitment will advance the future development of the CBE's graduate programming at Clark Atlanta University and expands current CBE programming at Spelman and Morehouse Colleges, supporting the next generation of Black entrepreneurial talent in the Atlanta area.And just last week, Cisco participated in 2022 National HBCU week on a panel sponsored by the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through HBCUs . We talked about our partnership with Student Freedom Initiative and how our $150 million commitment, the largest corporate donation to HBCUs in our nation's history, is impacting the entire HBCU ecosystem.Momentum for the FutureAs I reflect on what we have been able to accomplish over the past two years, I am proud of the impact we are making. While it is still early in our journey, we have created a successful framework to carry out our Actions and generated momentum that will carry us forward. I am grateful to have been part of Cisco's social justice journey and I thank everyone, our employees, customers, and partners who have been on this journey with us. Together-we can power an inclusive future for all.View original content here .View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721325/Our-Commitment-to-Social-Justice-2-Years-in-the-Making]"

If you want to see more of the biggest Dow companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, is one of the oldest indexes in the world. Having been founded in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the index is easily one of the most followed indexes in the world.Originally the The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprised of only 12 companies, mainly with operations in oil and gas, sugar, tobacco and railroads. As the U.S. economy evolved, however, so did the Dow index. Now the index includes 30 companies, with companies operating in many different sectors including technology. As it did before, the companies listed on the Dow today are among the leaders in their core fields.Given that it only includes 30 large capitalization U.S. companies, the Dow index arguably doesn't reflect the U.S. economy as well as another popular index, the S&amp;P 500, which includes 500 U.S. companies. Furthermore, since the Dow index is a price weighted index, stocks with higher stock prices have more influence on the index regardless of their market cap. Price weighted indexes are also affected by stock splits while market cap weighted indexes are not.While it has its limitations, The Dow Jones Industrial Average has nevertheless done well with the index rising from 40.45 on January 1, 1897 to 30,423.81 on 10/19/22.Given economic cycles, Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced bull and bear markets over the years.According to Guggenheim, the Dow Jones has experienced four secular bear markets in its history before this year. Each of the four secular bear markets lasted for over 10 years and the average annualized returns over those years were near zero or slightly negative. Meanwhile, the Dow has experienced 5 secular bull markets, each of which have lasted from 5 years to 17 years in length. The average annualized returns of those bull markets have been 8.72% or higher.Story continuesGiven the stock market's performance in 2022, it seems we are in a bear market, although it isn't a secular bear market.Due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates substantially this year, the markets have declined substantially. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen almost 17% year to date and S&amp;P 500 has fallen nearly 23% year to date.With inflation remaining high, it seems the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates even more. With the rate hikes and increasing probability of a recession in 2023, the markets could decline further if economic data doesn't meet expectations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for investors to own a well diversified portfolio of quality stocks across many different sectors. In the Dow Jones index, here are some leading stocks:MethodologyFor the 15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap, we took the 15 largest stocks listed on the The Dow Jones Industrial Average by market capitalization as of 10/19 according to FINVIZ.com and we ranked them #15 to #1.15 Biggest Dow Companies By Market Cap15.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) is a leading maker of IP based networking and other products with a market capitalization of almost $174 billion as of 10/19. Although its shares are down 34% year to date, analysts are expecting Cisco Systems, Inc.
