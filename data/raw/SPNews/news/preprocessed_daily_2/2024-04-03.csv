But this phenomenon is not a new one. Data shows that since the end of 2008, US stocks with dividend yields over 5% returned about 450%, compared to a 1200% return posted by non-dividend companies. However, many analysts believe this is about to change since the era of easy money where interest rates were almost zero is nearing its end. A Wall Street Journal report recently highlighted some trends in dividend investing shared by Daniel Peris in his book “The Ownership Dividend - The Coming Paradigm Shift in the U.S. Stock Market.” Peris argues that the pendulum might shift in favor of dividend stocks since the forces behind the almost 40-year period of low interest rates and buybacks seem to have exhausted and the market could return to the typical structure in which dividends had a lot of importance.', 'There was a time when investing in a company automatically meant you’d get dividends from it since markets were not fixated around short-term share price movements. As Benjamin Graham once said:', '""The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends regularly and, presumably, to increase the rate as time goes on.""', 'From the 1870s to the 1950s, dividends accounted for about 80% of the total market returns, according to the WSJ report which cited economist Robert\xa0J.\xa0Shiller, Sterling Professor of\xa0Economics at Yale. This contribution to returns by dividends declined to 30% over the past decade. But could the tide really turn in the favor of dividends? Early signs are here. Meta Platforms surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a $0.50 a share dividend. Analysts believe as investor appetite for steady income and low volatility increases and markets begin to digest the possibility of the higher for longer scenario, dividend-paying stocks would see a renewed interest.', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first scanned through the list of dividend aristocrats — a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. From this list we chose 11 companies with at least 50 years of consistent dividend increases and positive hedge fund sentiment. We preferred stocks with relatively low payout ratios (under 50%), wider moats and positive analyst ratings. The idea was to prefer dividend growth companies that are offering safe dividends and are deemed investment worthy by smart money managers. But why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).', 'Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 40', 'Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) is one of the biggest steel companies in America, with about 50 years of consistent dividend increases.

This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company’s results of operations as well as comparability with many of its peers, especially those companies focused more on technology and software. Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.', 'The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin for total company and by segment are “operating profit” and “operating profit margin,” respectively, for total company and by segment, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, and special charges. Adjusted operating profit margin is adjusted operating profit divided by net sales for total company and by segment.

Adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by net sales for total company. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, special charges, and miscellaneous (income) expense, net.

A calculation of this measure is available in this news release.', 'The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures.

ARE recently clinched an early renewal with the machine learning-powered drug discovery and development company insitro for a six-year lease extension at the Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies mega campus in South San Francisco.Being a significant early renewal, the lease extension for 143,188 rentable square feet (RSF) at 279 East Grand Avenue will run through Aug 31, 2034. This move will ensure steady rental revenues from this property for the long term. \xa0It emphasizes the necessity for ample laboratory facilities to produce extensive datasets crucial for AI-driven advancements in medicine and reaffirms Alexandria's strong capacity to facilitate companies engaged in the burgeoning area of AI-enhanced laboratory-based research and development.Acknowledging the potential of insitro's groundbreaking platform that leverages AI, particularly machine learning (ML), and extensive data to unravel complex biological processes and uncover novel medications across various therapeutic domains, including metabolism, oncology and neuroscience, Alexandria had executed its first lease with insitro in 2018. That lease encompassed nearly 36,000 RSF Labspace infrastructure at 279 East Grand Avenue.The South San Francisco submarket is home to the densest concentration of life science companies in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The weighted average remaining lease term of all tenants is 7.4 years, increasing from 7 years at the end of the prior quarter. For Alexandria’s top 20 tenants, it is 9.6 years, increasing from 8.9 years as of the end of the prior quarter.

Alexandria provides a top-tier health plan, for which it covers 100% of the premiums for its employees and their eligible family members — a truly exceptional practice that distinguishes the company from the 96% of U.S. employers who require an employee contribution for individual coverage and the 99% who require it for family coverage, as reported in Mercer's 2023 annual benefits survey. Alexandria also offers its team members excellent career advancement opportunities, personalized professional development and training programs, and volunteer programs to foster a collaborative, mission-driven culture."", ""Alexandria's dedication to making a positive and lasting impact on human health and society is core to enhancing stakeholder trust.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank.

In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

This included a very strong holiday season. For the fourth quarter, we drove double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce and high single-digit growth in our stores. This was offset by a challenging wholesale channel resulting in flat revenues overall for the quarter on a reported basis and down 1% in constant currency. We continue to drive quality of sales up with higher AURs and we expanded our gross margins by 440 basis points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered 40% increase in EBIT dollars and 12.1% EBIT margin and an EPS growth of over 50%. For the full year, we grew revenue 2% on a reported basis and 1% in constant currency, including high single-digit D2C growth, while expanding our gross margins by 140 basis points, and we drove a 9% increase in EBIT dollars and a 60 basis point increase in EBIT margins to 10.1%. And we delivered EPS growth of nearly 20% and achieved a record high EPS. We ended the year with inventory in great shape, down 21% compared to last year and produced significant cash flow, which we used to buy back approximately $550 million of stock. Looking back on the first 2 years of PVH+ Plan execution, you can see a clear trend in that where we lean in to execute, we deliver. We have put 100% of our focus on our globally beloved iconic brands, Calvin and Tommy, and divested all other regionally-focused brands. We are building a very strong leadership team with experience to move PVH from a legacy brand acquirer to leading brand builder. Today, I'm especially excited to share that Lea Rytz Goldman is starting this week as Tommy Hilfiger Global President. Lea most recently comes from successfully leading the cost brands impressive global growth. Through the PVH+ Plan, we have driven strong D2C growth for both 2022 and 2023 across all brands and all regions through strength in product, marketing and marketplace execution. We have developed strong product categories and see key categories and must-have Hero products, significantly increasing AURs and gross margin rate. We are executing breakthrough campaigns with very strong global talent amplification to really cut through with the consumer. During 2023, Calvin drove more consumer engagement than at any other time in the history of the brand with mega talent such as Jennie Kim, John Kook, Kendall Jenner, Michael B. Jordan and most recently, Jeremy Allen White. And Tommy went back to its roots of Classic American Cool. Most recently created cut through global attention with its return to New York Fashion Week. We have strengthened the brand experience across social, e-commerce and stores. And in an increasingly tough wholesale channel, we have deepened our relationships with our key partners and applied a strong quality of sales focus globally. Regionally, we have grown our European business in a very tough macro environment, with our business today over $4 billion, over 20% larger than 2019 and driving higher profits. We have started to successfully unlock North America despite a choppy backdrop, driving significant margin expansion, including an 8.3% EBIT margin for 2023. And we are taking back our license of core product categories as part of a multiyear transition beginning in 2025, which will allow us to draw on the power and expertise of our global brand teams.We have also turned Asia into a growth engine where we are now taking share on a consistent basis with double-digit constant currency revenue growth in both 2022 and 2023. As a company, we have successfully started to build out our data and demand-driven operating model. We are reducing inventory as a percentage of sales while driving higher availability and stock freshness. The quality of our product is up, the cost of goods is down and the pricing power is up, all leading to higher gross margins. We continue to invest behind our growth initiatives including increasing marketing spend to approximately 6% of sales for 2023 to fuel cut-through campaigns and global talent amplification, all while driving cost efficiencies across the company. And we have significantly increased our cash flow, enabled us to invest in growth and increase our share buybacks to historically high levels. Over the last 2 years, we have repurchased nearly $1 billion of our stock, representing approximately 17% of our outstanding shares. Now, let me share a bit more of what drove our strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year, both from a global brand and regional perspective. Starting with Calvin Klein. The brand continued to cut through with record strong global campaigns. In the fourth quarter, our spring campaign with Jeremy Allen White captured global attention, generating over $12 million in media exposure in the first 48 hours and reaching more than $40 million on the brand's Instagram. Our Hero underwear styles were in the heart of culture conversation, followed by Jeremy style in Calvin's Menswear for a Golden Globe's win. In the U.S. alone, week 1 of the campaign generated more than 30% growth in underwear versus last year. The campaign continued with Idris Elba in Menswear, Jennie Kim and Kendall Jenner in womenswear and Jung Kook in our most iconic denim, all to amplify our Calvin Klein lifestyle offering. Turning to Tommy Hilfiger. In Tommy, we continue to drive relevance by leaning into the brand's unique DNA of Classic American Cool. We started off the year with Tommy's return to New York Fashion Week, creating a true New York moment and driving both high visibility and engagement. The runway show had massive talent reach, resulting in over 3,000 PR placements and a reach of over 6 billion. We were the most talked about brand at New York Fashion Week, dominating online conversation. In February, we announced Sofia Richie as the new partner for Tommy Womenswear. And last month, Tommy launched its Spring 2024 campaign featuring Kendall Jenner. And yesterday, we launched a global cut-through campaign featuring Stray Kids, 1 of the top 3 K-Pop bands worldwide. Now let me turn to our regional performance. Starting with North America. I'm very proud of how our team continued to lean into the PVH+ Plan drivers in the fourth quarter, achieving strong D2C growth, up high single digits for both brands and delivering a significant improvement in profitability. For the fourth quarter, we again delivered a double-digit EBIT margin for the region, including higher gross margins and AURs. Overall revenue for Tommy and Calvin was stronger than we expected, driven by strong growth in direct-to-consumer, which was offset by declines in wholesale. For 2023, our Calvin and Tommy businesses together delivered an 8.3% EBIT margin, a big step-up of nearly 500 basis points year-over-year despite modestly lower revenues. This demonstrates the significant progress we are making in building the foundation for long-term brand accretive growth in the North America region. Let me share a few North America highlights. For Tommy, the D2C growth was broad-based, led by seasonal premium essentials in key categories with strong AUR increases. We returned a number of stores back to 2019 profitability levels despite much lower international tourism. And for Calvin, leading with our category offense, we successfully reestablished our refined assortment. We continue to elevate the online shopping experience and have delivered 4 consecutive quarters of high-quality double-digit growth on ck.com. For both brands, we continue to build strength with our key wholesale partners led by men's sportswear. Looking to 2024 for North America. We plan to deliver another year of strong D2C growth with further increases in quality of sales across the marketplace, to deliver another year of significant improvement in profitability. Turning to our international business. In Europe, building on our historically large business, market-leading awareness and brand strength across both Tommy and Calvin, for 2023, the region delivered low single-digit revenue growth in euros. In the fourth quarter, revenue again exceeded EUR 1 billion and most importantly, delivered much stronger overall profitability. Revenue for the quarter declined low single digits in euros compared to last year and in an increasingly tough macro, we drove mid-single-digit growth in D2C, which was offset by declines in Wholesale. Since we spoke in December, we have seen consumer sentiment further slow across Europe, especially in our 2 biggest markets Germany and the U.K., and we have seen our wholesale partners there become even more cautious. Let me share a few examples of what this tougher European macro means for us and how we're choosing to sacrifice sales growth in the near term to strengthen our unique brand position in the market for the long term. Our #1 focus here has been to avoid having too much inventory in the market, and we have succeeded very well with this, starting the year with much less old clearance inventory than the same time last year, driven by our supply chain improvements. As an example, in February, we were up against a greater proportion of discounted sales last year and this year, we made a proactive decision to come into the month with lower outgoing stock and higher share of the new spring season inventory. As an effect, we're starting the spring season with significantly improved stock freshness, which is driving double-digit comp increases for our spring product, while prior season clearance sales and inventory are down over 20%.In Wholesale, forward orders from our partners have become more cautious. This is reflected in our fall 2024 order books, which we expect will be down high single digits versus the prior year. It's important to remember that our wholesale partners are coming off a very tough fall season across the sector from last year, driven by the warmest fall start since the 1800s, which led to too much inventory and high promotionality in the market. In this tougher environment, we are making proactive decisions towards quality of sales, to build our brands for the long term and position us for sustainable, brand accretive growth. In Wholesale, this means in midyear 2024, we are stopping sales of our brands by third parties on digital platforms and significantly reducing the number of digital platforms that we sell to. This will increase the quality of sales with our most important wholesale partners across both bricks-and-mortar and online. And across all channels, we are buying inventory much closer to demand, significantly reducing our need to manage discounted prior season inventory. The collective impact of these quality of sales decisions is a reduction equivalent of approximately 5% of our total sales for our 2024 European business. It will drive gross margin expansion and more importantly, enable brand accretive growth over time. In parallel to these quality of sales improvements, we're also stepping up our product category offense, driving innovation in key categories and must-have essentials for fall 2024, where we will have more transitional products, more technical fabrics, more dress casual and this has been very well received by our key wholesale partners. It will also further strengthen our D2C execution, where we have the most control over the brand experience, and we continue to drive increased pricing power and margin expansion. Moving to Asia Pacific, our Asia team's disciplined PVH+ Plan execution across both Calvin and Tommy drove strong growth for both the quarter and the year. For the year, the region delivered revenue growth of 15% in constant currency, including growth of 17% in the fourth quarter led by D2C. China is an important growth engine, which grows over 20% in local currency for both the fiscal year and fourth quarter as we successfully captured key consumer moments. Outside of China, fourth quarter performance was also strong, with over 30% growth in Korea and double-digit growth in Japan in constant currency. We delivered strong e-commerce growth with both brands achieving double-digit growth during Double 11 and ranked among the top international brands on Tmall. Revenue and market share set new records on Douyin as we continue to engage consumers in new ways. We continue to win in the important Lunar New Year holiday, fueled by successful Capsule launches and consumer activations for both brands. Our brands and products have a clear premium positioning with opportunity to grow further in all markets. We continue to focus on driving overall brand awareness, especially in China, where both Calvin and Tommy are underpenetrated. Now let's switch gears and turn to our overall company outlook. Following the strong 2023, where we gained traction on each of the underlying growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, we will build on this momentum in 2024. Across the company, we are leaning into the next level of PVH+ Plan execution. This will directly translate into growth in Asia and North America, while in Europe, where the macro has become more challenging, our focus is on quality of sales to further strengthen our market-leading position. From a numbers perspective, this translates into our guidance for 2024 of revenue down 6% to 7% or down approximately 3% to 4% on a comparable basis, excluding the sale of our Heritage Brands intimates business, at 53rd Week in 2023. We're driving further gross margin expansion and despite the deleverage from our European business, we will maintain our EBIT margins versus 2023. At the same time, Zac will take you through how we are leaning into unlock significant cost efficiencies in a way that we will even better align our cost structure to the PVH+ Plan growth drivers, leading to another year of EPS growth in 2024. As we go forward, we will further strengthen Calvin and Tommy brands desirability by building out our global product, marketing, experience engines under the strong global brand leadership that we now have in place. We will continue to amplify our category offense and key Hero product strategies globally. We will further win with consumer engagement by executing strong cut-through campaigns, amplified by the best global mega talent. And in the marketplace, we are relentlessly focused on driving higher quality of sales across all regions and channels, which will continue to drive pricing power and margin expansion across the company. Everywhere the consumer and macro will allow, we will drive high-quality revenue growth and where the consumer and macro are tougher, we are willing to sacrifice short-term, low-quality revenues in order to strengthen our brand position and pricing power. This is the right way to build our brands and business for the long term. In D2C, where we have the most direct control of the shopping experience, you will see us drive high-quality growth across both brands and all regions. We will continue to elevate the consumer experience online and off-line in our owned and operated channels as well as with key wholesale partners. You will see us continue to build out our demand-driven supply chain, maximizing inventory productivity. And across the company, you will see us investing in long-term growth in areas including marketing, as well as CapEx for technology, store renovations, new store expansion and supply chain initiatives. At the same time, we're getting in even better shape from a cost efficiency perspective, which Zac will share more details on. And lastly, we will continue to significantly improve our cash flow, which will enable us to make further stock repurchases. In closing, in 2023, we fully focused on and strengthen the desirability of our 2 globally-iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and we drove very strong financial performance across both brands and all regions. For 2024, we will continue to build on the PVH+ Plan execution momentum across the company that will translate directly to growth in Asia and North America, while we sacrificed near-term sales growth in Europe to further strengthen our unique market position there for long-term brand accretive growth. Our PVH+ momentum is building in both the consumer-facing parts, driving the brand desirability up in product, marketing and marketplace and in how we build out the data and demand-driven business engine. Step-by-step, guided by our PVH+ Plan, we're building Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world and making PVH one of the highest performing brand groups in our sector. And I want to thank my entire team for all your great work in making our vision come to life. And now I'll turn the call over to Zac."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue flat to the prior year and more importantly, we delivered significant earnings growth in the quarter versus last year, led by the sizable step-up in our gross margin we had planned for all year.Our EBIT was $301 million, 40% higher than prior year, and our operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, up 350 basis points versus last year. On the bottom line, we once again exceeded our guidance with a record-setting fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.72, which was over 50% higher than last year.Our ability to drive significant operating margin expansion and earnings growth, in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment, is a testament to our disciplined execution. We also delivered strong cash flow this year with free cash flow of over $700 million. This includes inventory being down 21% compared to last year as we continue to position inventory to focus on quality of sales. We also completed the sale of our Heritage Intimates business in the fourth quarter for $160 million. The result of our work on cash allowed us to repurchase $280 million of shares in the fourth quarter and an all-time high of $550 million share repurchases for the full year.I will now discuss our 2023 results in more detail and then move on to our outlook for 2024. As I mentioned earlier, revenue for the fourth quarter was flat compared to last year and reflected a 1% positive impact from exchange. The benefit from the 53rd Week was largely offset by the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Intimates business.Starting from a regional perspective, fourth quarter revenue for our international business was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Sales in our Asia Pacific business were up 17% on a constant currency basis and up 13% on a reported basis as strong consumer demand drove growth in all markets, led by China, with the lifting of COVID restrictions negatively impacted the fourth quarter last year. Sales in Europe were down 2% in euros as mid-single-digit growth in the DTC business was more than offset by high single-digit decline in wholesale sales.In North America, revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses combined was down 2% as high single-digit growth in DTC was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales. Within DTC, our retail stores were up high single digits, and our owned and operated e-commerce business was up mid-teens.Looking at overall fourth quarter revenue from a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our DTC businesses. Our total DTC revenue was up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis in the quarter and also up 9% on a constant currency basis in both our stores and our owned and operated e-commerce, with approximately half of the increase due to the benefit from the 53rd Week. Total wholesale revenue for the quarter was down 10% on a reported basis and down 12% on a constant currency basis as retailers around the world continue to take a cautious approach to orders and shipments. This includes a 3% reduction from the sale of the Heritage Intimates business and a benefit from the 53rd Week.Turning to our global brands. Calvin Klein revenues were up 4%, and Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Calvin Klein was up 3% and Tommy Hilfiger was down 1%, as the macroeconomic challenges impacting Europe weigh more heavily on the Tommy business. Importantly, our DTC business was up in both brands and in all regions.In the fourth quarter, we delivered record high gross margin of 60.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to last year, with approximately half of the improvement due to a favorable shift in channel and region mix and approximately half due to lower raw material costs and ocean freight rates.SG&A expense as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter was 48.2%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year. The increase is more than explained by higher expenses due to DTC mix, partially offset by an approximately 125-basis-point improvement in expenses versus last year due to savings realized from the actions we have taken to reduce people costs and prudent management of expenses.In total, EBIT for the quarter was $301 million, 40% higher than the prior year and exceeding expectations. Operating margin was 12.1% and expanded 350 basis points compared to last year, with improvements in all regions including a 550-basis-point expansion for North America for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger combined.Earnings per share increased over 50% to $3.72 compared to $2.38 in last year's fourth quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.27, largely driven by the EBIT improvement. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 21%.For the full year 2023, we drove significant profitability and earnings growth versus last year in spite of the challenging macro environment. Revenue was up 2% versus last year including a positive impact of 1% from exchange and EBIT was up 9% driven by operating margin expansion. Our operating margin of 10.1% reflected a 60 basis points improvement versus last year. And on the bottom line, we delivered record high non-GAAP EPS of $10.68 for the year, which reflects a growth of 19%.Now moving on to our outlook. In 2024, we are committed to building on the momentum coming out of 2023, leaning into the PVH+ Plan to drive profitability improvements in North America, strong growth in Asia Pacific, a focus on quality of sales in Europe, further matching inventory to demand and delivering efficiencies to fund future growth. That said, we have taken a cautious approach to planning 2024 due to the softening consumer backdrop we saw in January and February and a conservative wholesale environment.For the full year, overall revenue is projected to decline between 6% and 7% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to 2023 including a 2% decline due to the sale of the Heritage intimates business and a 1% decline due to the 53rd Week in 2023. We expect full year operating margin will be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023 and are projecting earnings per share in a range of $10.75 to $11, up low single digits versus 2023 despite the top line pressures.Our sales outlook for the North America Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses combined is planned up low-single digits versus 2023 with mid-single-digit growth in the DTC business tempered by wholesale. Within wholesale, we are focused on strong quality of sales and winning with our key wholesale partners. But we do see retailers continue to take a cautious approach. This wholesale environment is also impacting our licensing partners in the region, and our overall licensing revenue is planned down high-single digits.Asia Pacific is planned to grow high-single digits on a constant currency basis with growth again projected in all markets and led by DTC.Now turning to Europe. As Stefan mentioned, we saw consumer sentiment further slow in January and February and our fall 2024 order books are increasingly cautious. In this tougher environment, we are making strategic choices to focus on higher quality sales across all channels. As a result, we have planned Europe sales down high-single digits in euros. Wholesale is planned down low-double digits for the reasons I just mentioned, and DTC is planned down low-single digits with modest comp door growth, offset by reductions in our own sales through third-party platforms.While overall revenue is projected to be lower than 2023, our gross margin is expected to increase approximately 200 basis points, reaching an all-time high with approximately half of the increase due to channel and customer mix as we grow our higher-margin DTC business, and decrease sales to lower-margin wholesale accounts and approximately half due to lower raw material costs, which were elevated during the first half of 2023, but began to ease in the second half.SG&A dollars are planned down for the full year 2024 as compared to 2023, but are expected to increase approximately 200 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Approximately 150 basis points of the increase is due to the deleveraging of expenses on our lower European revenues in 2024 and approximately 150 basis points is due to higher DTC mix.Beyond those 2 impacts, we continue to drive approximately 100 basis points of cost efficiencies across the business, while at the same time, maintaining strategic investments in our global brands, including marketing in order to drive long-term growth. As a result, we expect our full year operating margin will be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023. Excluding the significant impact of deleverage due to sales, operating margin would have been approximately 150 basis points higher.Interest expense is projected to be relatively flat compared to $88 million in 2023 and our tax rate for the year is estimated at approximately 21%.Looking at the balance sheet, we are heading into 2024 in a very strong financial position. Working capital is in great shape, and our leverage is low. We are projecting capital spending of approximately $300 million as we invest in our stores, supply chain and technology in line with our PVH+ priorities. And with the $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program that we announced yesterday, we are currently planning $400 million of share repurchases in 2024.Turning to the first quarter, we are projecting revenue to decline approximately 11% as reported and approximately 10% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year including a 3% decline due to the sale of the Heritage Intimates business and a 1% decline due to the impact on wholesale sales from the 53rd week in 2023. While we are projecting low single-digit growth in our DTC businesses, we expect this will be more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, primarily in Europe for the reasons I mentioned earlier.We expect our first quarter operating margin to be approximately flat to first quarter last year, with higher gross margins fully offsetting the loss of leverage due to the decline in revenue. Our first quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $2.15 compared to $2.14 in the prior year. Our tax rate for the first quarter is estimated at approximately 21% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $20 million.Looking ahead beyond 2024, we remain confident in our path to achieve the 15% operating margin target we committed in the PVH+ Plan. We will do that through improvements in both gross margin and SG&A. As discussed earlier, we will take a significant step up in 2024 in gross margin through a focus on quality of sales and significant supply chain improvements. We expect to see the improvements continue beyond 2024.And while we have made significant progress in SG&A expenses, we are not close to done there either. We are embarking on the next phase of growth driver 5 of the PVH+ Plan to drive efficiencies in a couple of meaningful ways. First, on technology, we have completed a global study of our IT spending and the result is a road map to decrease global technology spending by over 1/3. We will do that by delivering a single global tech stack that all business units will leverage. And in January, we onboarded a new global Chief Technology and Information Officer, the experience driving global transformational change at other best-in-class consumer companies.Next is a focus on global logistics costs. We have already delivered a significant reduction in inventory. This lighter supply chain allows us to redesign our global logistics network to be more efficient. We expect this to deliver over 50 basis points in operating margin improvement. There is also ongoing work that continues within our support functions globally. We see opportunities to centralize processes and improve systems and automation to drive more efficient and cost-effective ways of working, again, led by a focus on consistent execution of the PVH+ Plan around the world. We believe this will generate at least 50 basis points of operating margin improvement.And finally, in Europe, historically, our global Tommy Hilfiger global brand and Europe commercial organizations have been highly intertwined, leading to complex ways of working. With the appointment of Lea Rytz Goldman as the leader for the global Tommy brand, this allows us the opportunity to reengineer the European operating model and unlock significant efficiencies. The work on these initiatives has already begun and will continue over the next couple of years. We expect this work to result in an incremental 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement on top of the SG&A leverage we expect to recapture as we grow our global brands in the future.Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to win in a tough environment as evidenced by our performance in 2023. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results, and as Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on executing the 5 key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing growth drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with our underlying operating engines to deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth.And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""Thanks for all the additional color. So 2-part question. Maybe Stefan first. Could you speak to underlying health of the Tommy and Calvin brands today or maybe just help elaborate on current direct-to-consumer demand trends that you're seeing across geographies, if we could parse through the sales that you mentioned that you're proactively sacrificing at both direct and wholesale? And then for Zac, what gives you confidence in mid-teens as the right margin structure multiyear and how does the 2024 forecast alter the past?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Well, thank you, Matt, and good morning. Okay. Let us take the 3 different parts of this question. I'll start with the 2 first. So if it comes to -- let's start with brand strength. So as I mentioned, we see an all-time high consumer engagement across both Calvin and Tommy. And if we look at the start of the Spring Campaign with Calvin, with their campaign with Jeremy Allen White, we had the biggest cut-through campaign in all of the fashion industry. So some data to back up that. So we had an earned media value of over 74 million so far with that campaign. We have 134 million engaged brand fans on Instagram, which was 60% up versus same time last year. And then the engagement of those 134 million were 13%, which was up 85% year-over-year.So what you're seeing from Calvin is demonstrated consistency in delivering cut-through campaigns with Jennie Kim, Kendall Jenner, Jung Kook, and you will increasingly see new talent coming into the brand on a consistent basis. So that's Calvin. On Tommy, we have developed a consistent -- you'll see a consistent way of driving high relevance through going back to the unique DNA of the brand, Classic American Cool. So a few examples from this spring. Tommy went back to New York Fashion Week. We had a reach of over 6 billion. So when we do the fashion show with Tommy, we also work with maximizing the talent reach on the front row and 6 billion took us to the most cut-through show in New York Fashion Week, plus it took us as the only non-luxury brand into the top 10 of all brands, luxury included across all fashion weeks globally.So you look at New York, London, Milan, Paris, so top 10. And yesterday, as I mentioned, we launched another cut-through campaign with Tommy featuring Stray Kids and Stray Kids is now 1 of the top 3 K-Pop bands globally. So that's one way of looking at brand strength and brand relevance. But another way that I like to look at it is, I spent -- as you know, I'm spending a lot of time being out in stores, traveling out in the markets. I spend roughly 50%, 60% of my time.And what I keep seeing when I come to big shopping malls is, let's say that the shopping mall has 140 -- over 140 brands. And then I meet the owners of the shopping centers saying that 30% of all or over 30% of all the traffic coming to the shopping mall comes to one of our brands. And that, to me, is just a really impressive figure to tap into because think about the consumer today. They have all the choice in the world. They have only so much time and over 30%. And this is something I hear across Europe. I hear it in North America, and I hear it in Asia Pacific, but most importantly, translating that into growth. So D2C growth, your second part of your question. So last year, we drove 9% growth in D2C as a company. North America drove 7%. Asia drove 17%. And in Europe, we drove 5%. And the PVH+ execution, the momentum we translate that into 2024, and it directly connects to growth in North America and Asia. So if you look at D2C growth expected for Q1 and the full year for '24, North America continues mid-single digit, Asia continues double-digit growth. And in Europe, to your question about quality of sales, we see low single-digit decline. And this is a decline that's proactive sacrifice that we make in this tougher environment.So the D2C related part of that is making sure that we have less inventory in the market and less inventory to demand, and at the same time, have higher availability. So you can see that already now in our European business that we have much less outgoing stock, old inventory, less discounted old inventory, much more of the new stock driving double-digit comp increases. So spring season alone drive double-digit comp increases. So what you will see from us on the D2C side is sacrificing some of the top line growth in the near term to position us for long-term growth, brand accretive increasingly profitable in the long term.And this is a good connection. Zac to if you can lay out the path we see to the 15% operating margin."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. I mean we remain just as confident in our ability to deliver the 15% operating margin commitments. As we mentioned earlier, excluding the loss of top line leverage this year, driven by quality of sales choices, operating margin would have been around 11.5%. So a significant step forward on gross margin due to gross margin and SG&A work.And we've mentioned earlier on the call, we've identified the next round of opportunities in SG&A efficiencies worth 200 to 300 basis points. So if you put that together, you're almost there. Before we even talk about more opportunities to leverage our scale and supply cost, our growth in Asia, which is our most profitable market and further unlocks in North America beyond the 500-basis-point improvement we've delivered in 2023. I think though with respect to timing of achieving the 15%, our expectations for 2024 obviously makes our 2025 target timing exceedingly difficult.And the PVH+ Plan and the 5 growth drivers are absolutely the right strategy for us to drive sustainable, long-term profitable growth. And importantly, given our progress across the P&L, our path to 15% remains fully intact, even if it may take a year or two longer."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""So Stefan, I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on the quality of sales initiatives in Europe. I think you mentioned some third party and you mentioned online channels that you want to reduce exposure to. Can you just tell us a little bit about more of those channels, what they're like, why it's important to not distribute through those channels? And what gives you confidence that the quality of sale initiatives that you're undertaking are going to have the desired effect as we look out into fiscal '25 and beyond?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Jay. Yes. So Matt's question was related more to D2C. So when we look at the full market, there are 3 big actions we are taking to increase quality of sales in Europe this year. The first one is mid-year we are stopping sales of our brands by third parties on digital platforms. So we are enabled by a change in European regulations that makes it possible to do this, which is very important to keep the distribution quality high and keep the pricing power up.The second initiative we take is to reduce the number of digital platforms we sell to. So we will reduce approximately 30% of the platforms we historically have sold to, again, to focus on the key platforms, our key wholesale partners to increase the quality of sales with them. And the third part is what I mentioned when I answered Matt's question, which was across all channels, we are buying inventory much closer to demand. So again, you see it already now that spring season is up, gross margin is up and all the inventories down and that's what you will continue to see from us.We're down -- overall, we are down 20% in inventory. And you will see us continue to drive the business with higher quality of sales and less inventory. And that's how we will continue to position ourselves for long-term sustainable growth. And the PVH+ Plan is a plan to tap into the unique potential of having 2 of the most iconic beloved brands globally in the fashion industry and tapping into the DNA of those brands. And in a very systematic way, drive product strength, consumer engagement strength, marketplace strength and then connecting that to the underlying demand and data-driven engine.And we have talked about that since we kicked off the plan 2 years ago, and now you really see that we're able to drive much higher quality sales. And for 2024 outlook as well, gross margin and pricing power is up across all regions."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Thanks for all the detail here, helps us take this through. I guess, first, just tactically, can you help talk us through the bridge through the year from first quarter sales? I think the core is down 7%, excluding Heritage and then improving the rest of the year to get to the down 3% to 4% at the core. Could you maybe help us break that down between direct-to-consumer and wholesale, where we would expect to see those improvements embedded and what's driving that? And then I guess, if D2C is -- I think, Stefan or maybe Zac you said, D2C is planned to be down low single digits in Europe.What -- why does that have to stay negative? I know you cited trends in wholesale channel in January and February were tough, but it sounds like you're pretty encouraged with the spring numbers. And maybe that's being weighed down so far in the first quarter by a lot less clearance. But as you get away from that clearance period, if the current season inventory is working, some of the industry data and some of the big markets in Europe has picked up around Easter. Why couldn't that number improve through the year?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""So let me start with your question, Michael, about the D2C expectations for Europe for the rest of the year. It doesn't have to stay this way. What we are doing is we are guiding based on what we see. We see a consumer slowdown in Europe, especially on our 2 biggest markets Germany and the U.K. in January and February. So what we're doing is we are making sure that the focus is on quality of sales, and we are pulling the inventory down to the trends we see right now.And then of course, if these changes we are able to react into that and to follow the demand. But our strategy will always remain the same, which is to follow the demand that we see from the consumer and to do it in an increasingly profitable way."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And then, Michael, I think your question around sequential improvement throughout the back end of the year, I would say, consistent with what Stefan just said, the year, we've actually planned quite consistently. We stay away from trying to forecast the macros. We're building the outlook based on what we see today. The reason why first quarter looks a little more -- a little weaker than where our full year guide is for minus 6% to 7% is really tied to some wholesale shipment timing issues. With the 53rd Week, there were some shipments pulled into 2023 in Europe because January is a big spring shipment season and some timing shipments out of first quarter into second quarter as we match shipment timing to Europe to when sellout season is focused from there.If you adjust for those 2 issues, the outlook for the full year is actually quite consistent. And if we looked at retail specifically where those don't affect, our retail outlook has actually shows that level of consistency throughout the year for our total business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""I was wondering if you could spend a little more time on North America, just the progress that you're seeing in North America, expand on your comments a bit, specifically just the assumptions for the sales by partner, specifically Macy's assumptions in your -- in North America Wholesale outlook. Just would love for you to sort of unpack that a bit more just in terms of the broader picture as well."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. Thank you, Bob. As I shared in my prepared remarks, really proud of the team, how they are building an increasingly sustainable profitable base to continue to grow the business. So if you look at the outlook for '24, we see that continue. I mentioned mid-single-digit growth in D2C. We're actually in comp doors in wholesale with our key partners. We're also for 2024 driving comp sales growth.So what is driving this? It's the disciplined PVH+ execution. So product focus on driving product category offense that works for both Calvin and Tommy, innovation in the best must-have essentials to Hero products that works across both brands as well. We see, as a result, the pricing power and margin expansion, we see that the experience is improved. The improved brand experience for both Calvin and Tommy, if you go on to our website, you see that our experience is significantly improved versus last year.And we see all of this leading to growth in both D2C and Wholesale looking into 2024. And when it comes to Macy's, we see -- continue to see very encouraging performance where we lean in with them into their most important doors. We look at staffing together and we see a great effect of the top door focus, the staffing focus and the product category offense and the key essential focus."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.', 'Irwin Bernard Boruchow', ""Two questions from me. Maybe first for Zac. Just the gross margin for the Europe 200, that's helpful. Any way you could shape -- shape the progress through the year in terms of Q1 and just kind of the drivers and how those kind of flow through the year. And then maybe for Stefan or Zac, when we think about -- I know we're still a couple of years away, but when we think about that licensing business coming in-house, it looks like the revenue base of that business has changed a lot over the past couple of years. I believe a couple of years ago, it was around $1.5 billion at retail. I believe that your partner is now talking about it being closer to $1 billion planned for this year. When we think about the ultimate potential for you guys once you take that in-house, what kind of number should we be keeping in mind because it seems to be kind of changing as they kind of like have begun their wind down, it looks like of that business? That would be really helpful."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thanks, Mike. Let me start on the take back of our North America women's product categories for Wholesale. So we're taking that back over a multiyear period. We are on plan. We have really good partnership with our key wholesale accounts. We have the product engines built, the sourcing built, so everything is lined up to seamlessly connect the women's products that we are bringing in for North America into the PVH+ framework, which is about brand accreted long-term growth with pricing power. So all on plan."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And Mike, to your question around gross margin for the year. So if you think about how gross margin is improving, 2 main drivers, it's really the work around macros and supply chain. That started in the fourth quarter, really showing up last year and carries through and then the work on quality of sales, which we've begun some of that and talked about it last quarter and fourth quarter as well. So we'd expect to see significant improvements in Q1, 2 and 3. And then ultimately, Q4 being about flat to last year because a lot of the work has begun and showing up. So that's sort of -- but relatively equally weighted with regard to improvement in the first 3 quarters of the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Just on as you think about the Wholesale business and the enhancements for the quality of sales, you've mentioned North America and what you expect it to look like. How do you think of the percentage of sales coming from wholesale in Europe? And how do you think of it for the brands, both Tommy and Calvin, and as you enhance that quality of sales, is there a distribution in Asia also that needs to be adjusted?"", 'Stefan Larsson', 'Thank you, Dana. When it comes to quality of sales, as I mentioned, the quality of sales actions we take impacts positively, both the wholesale channel and the D2C channel. So our focus on wholesale is to continue to get closer to our biggest and most important partners. And they will benefit from the proactive actions we are taking in terms of cutting third-party sales of our brands to platforms, reducing the number of digital platforms we sell to, have less inventory overall.So the quality of sales will be seen by our partners in Europe and across all regions and in D2C. And you will see us -- you will -- you will see us in -- what was your last question, Dana, part of the question. Was that in Asia?', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', 'Yes.', 'Stefan Larsson', 'In Asia, okay. So in Asia, we have high quality of sales. We are predominantly D2C. So no changes there.We have time for one last question.', 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.', 'Christopher Michael Nardone', ""How are you thinking about the impact from this Red Sea disruption to both your European and U.S. businesses? And just trying to find out if you're incorporating any freight headwind in the back half of the year? And then as a related follow-up here, you talked about a slowdown in January and February throughout Europe, particularly in your 2 largest markets. Do you have any other color on how March is doing outside of your comments on the spring business picking up?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. So let's start on the -- let's start on the spring business. So we are in the middle of the Easter selling period, and Easter this year is earlier than last year, and so far, we are on plan. When it comes to Red Sea, it takes us 10 days longer to ship around and avoid the Red Sea. So it takes us 10 days longer. We don't see it having a significant impact on our overall supply chain.All right. With that, thank you for taking the time today. We are relentless in consistency and focus of the PVH+ Plan execution of driving long-term sustainable growth from our 2 iconic beloved brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And looking forward to catching up on this journey next quarter again. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This does conclude today's PVH Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.""]"

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", 'Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.', ' See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ', 'As you can see below, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.0b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$8.08b, its net debt is less, at about US$26.9b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.0b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$37.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.08b as well as receivables valued at US$9.66b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$34.1b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""Given Thermo Fisher Scientific has a humongous market capitalization of US$220.2b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.5 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 14.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. Unfortunately, Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT flopped 14% over the last four quarters. If earnings continue to decline at that rate then handling the debt will be more difficult than taking three children under 5 to a fancy pants restaurant. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 78% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""Happily, Thermo Fisher Scientific's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its EBIT growth rate. All these things considered, it appears that Thermo Fisher Scientific can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Thermo Fisher Scientific ."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Edwards Lifesciences'  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edwards Lifesciences is:', '21% = US$1.4b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""At first glance, Edwards Lifesciences seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. This probably laid the ground for Edwards Lifesciences' moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years."", ""Next, on comparing Edwards Lifesciences' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 14% over the last few years."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Edwards Lifesciences fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", ""Edwards Lifesciences doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Edwards Lifesciences' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

XYL has been benefiting from strength in Measurement & Control Solutions and accretive acquisitions despite weakness in the residential building solutions market and cost inflation.Let us discuss the factors why investors should retain the stock for the time being.', 'Business Strength: Strong backlogs, owing to underlying demand, are aiding Xylem. Due to the essential nature of the business, demand remains robust. The company has been benefiting from robust demand for metrology, water treatment and integrated solutions and services across utilities, industrial and building solutions end markets. Strong growth in the United States, Western Europe and emerging markets is driving Xylem’s top line (up 33% year over year in 2023). Higher volumes, productivity savings and pricing actions are supporting the company’s margins.At the end of 2023, the company’s backlog totaled $5.1 billion, up 5% year over year backed by strength across all regions. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 18.9% in 2023 from 17% in the previous year. For 2024, Xylem expects adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 19.4-19.9%, indicating an expansion of 50 to 100 basis points year over year.Segmental Strength: Resiliency across the utilities and industrial water applications end markets augurs well for Xylem. The Measurement & Control Solutions (M&CS) segment is benefiting from improving supply chains and strong demand in the test and measurement market. For 2023, the company expects the M&CS segment’s organic revenues to increase in the low-twenties digits. Growth in the utilities and industrial end markets is boosting the Water Infrastructure segment’s performance. The company expects Water Infrastructure organic revenues to increase in high-single digits in the current year.Strength in both the building solutions and industrial end markets/applications is a key catalyst to the Applied Water segment’s growth. Also, improvement in building solutions, driven by continued strength in the commercial market, should foster the unit’s growth. For 2023, Xylem expects the segment’s organic revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Accretive Acquisition: The company’s expansion initiative is expected to drive growth. The company acquired mission-critical water treatment solutions and services provider, Evoqua, in May 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle. The acquisition bolsters Xylem’s position in water technologies, solutions and services, and strengthens its foothold in lucrative end markets. The transaction is expected to deliver run-rate cost synergies of $140 million within three years upon closing. It is also expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments. In 2023, Xylem paid dividends of $299 million, up 37.8% year over year. The company also bought back shares worth $25 million in the same year. In February 2024, the company hiked its dividend by 9%. Also, in 2022, Xylem paid out dividends worth $217 million and bought back shares worth $52 million.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain XYL stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The dealmaking is already started to pick up in the first quarter.', ""Large deals are usually an indication of confidence in the market. So we've seen some mega deals already come to market in the first quarter. So we think that is a very good indication of what could come in '24 and '25, a continuation of that trend."", ""Obviously, we're reliant on those rate cuts to help ignite that speed at which that moves. But I do think there's still a lot of pent up demand, whether it be private credit, whether it be bank, lending, capabilities, and capital that we have to put to work. And we're seeing it already at Huntington and our pipelines that the deal flow is picking up. Not only on the buy sell side, but also on the pitch side with our investment bank arm."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Do you think that the presidential election will also play into timing at all, especially because the later the rate cuts come, the closer it gets to the election? So if I'm a company looking at making an acquisition, maybe I say, well, maybe I just wait a little bit longer to go ahead out?"", ""KAREN DAVIES Right. It certainly could. I mean, this is one of those where I'm a banker, I'm not an economist. But you know, and I would say investors might have an opportunity to make decisions based on monetary policy versus politics. But politics could certainly swing things one way or the other as we talk about personal tax implication and corporate tax implication."", ""But I think there's also this moment of a pretty significant one refi cliff that is coming in terms of the larger deals and leveraged finance. You've got a lot of private equity firms who have been holding deals for longer than they've wanted to. The window is opening up right now for them."", ""So I do think it may not come at the exact pace. If they don't hit the window by 9:30, I think they could be sitting on the sidelines waiting it out. Just like we saw in prior election cycles where they might hold off on M&A, they might hold off on CapEx to see what type of impact that might have to their business."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And the pick up in activity that you're expecting, are there certain sectors or industries where you would expect that to be more pronounced?"", ""KAREN DAVIES Sure. Yeah, we're already seeing it. So at Huntington, we're headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. So feet on the street everywhere through our lending verticals. Across the country, heavy Midwest."", 'Now in the Carolinas. Now in Texas. Capstone is part of our investment bank.', ""So together, we bring all those groups together. And we're seeing it in tech and telecom health care data centers as that is sort of a substitute for a bit of the different type of tech and telecom deals that were happening before.

Should people be stepping in here to buy the dip?"", ""BOB ELLIOTT: Well, I think there's been a healthy rally that has occurred over the course of the last five months or so end of last year and early this year. And what's happened is we've really repriced expectations significantly. Just think about consensus growth expectations in the US for 2024 went from well below 1 to now 2.2 for 2024.

That's how we were looking at things."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So, wherever we are right now? It seems like you guys agree strategically on one sector. And that sector is energy. Bill, I know you have a particular expertise there. So maybe let's start with you here."", ""Obviously, we've seen crude oil prices climbing up here. Do you think that run is going to continue, and do you chase oil itself, or do you play it in a different way?"", ""BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think oil overall, if you look at the futures, crude oil has really broken out above some of the previous supply zones where resistance was. And what I'd like to see is it build a support level around $83. Now, that's pretty close."", ""But I mean, we could have some significant elevation here in the coming days and weeks if we stay out above $83. Obviously, geopolitics have played a role in underpinning some of the strength. And we've had some new news overnight with the strikes on Iran, in the embassy, in Syria."", ""But China's data over the weekend. We've seen some real strength coming out of the manufacturing sector there. And then on top of that, I think there's something interesting going on within the currency space as China defends the Yuan."", ""So there's a lot of macro tailwinds that are coming abroad that could help continue to lift commodities in general. But one of the ways we're playing is managing the risk and have been positioning and call spreads that we continue to roll up and roll out in our commodity trading advisor. And that's how we're able to capture this with some limited risk as we rally.""]"

Just remember that a stock's valuation always matters. You can't unquestioningly pay any price for even the best companies and expect the returns you want."", 'With that in mind, some quality stocks are trading at attractive prices today. Among them are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and SentinelOne (NYSE: S).', 'Here is the pitch for each stock and why investors can confidently buy them today.', 'Social media giant Meta Platforms uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make more money from the nearly 4 billion people using its apps each month. Brands can now leverage AI tools to increase the efficiency of ads reaching their target audience. Meta has grown to over a trillion-dollar valuation on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, but Threads is steadily emerging as the next potential social media winner.', ""CEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that Threads, which competes with Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter), has grown to over 130 million monthly active users. There is still virtually no monetization occurring on Threads because Meta is focusing on increasing its user base. Still, this momentum is promising for a company that has proven it can turn social networks into cash cows."", ""Don't get me wrong; Meta is a table-pounding buy, even without knowing how Threads will eventually impact the business. Shares have surged over the past 18 months but still trade at a forward P/E ratio of 24. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by an average of 19% to 20% annually over the next three to five years, making the stock a potential bargain for its expected growth. No company does social media like Meta Platforms."", 'Enterprise software has become a vast industry that Salesforce sits squarely in the middle of. The company was built on its customer relationship management software but has expanded to virtually every aspect of what you need to run a company. After some bolt-on acquisitions, Salesforce also offers collaboration tools via Slack and data tools on Tableau.', ""Salesforce is using AI to enhance its existing business. This generative AI, which Salesforce calls Einstein, is implemented throughout Salesforce to make its various products more useful. It's like having a digital assistant at your side. It's an internal AI that helps users answer questions, understand and predict customer behaviors, and create content across all parts of Salesforce's software suite."", ""Financially, Salesforce is trading at attractive levels today. The stock trades at 31 times 2024 earnings, but that's supported by solid earnings growth that analysts see averaging nearly 18% over the coming years. That's a fair PEG ratio of 1.8. Investors can nibble on this blue chip technology stock and get more aggressive if shares slip to a more attractive price."", 'Other companies, such as SentinelOne, built their products on AI. SentinelOne is a cybersecurity company that uses AI to proactively hunt for viruses and other threats on devices and their networks. Cybersecurity is very competitive, so SentinelOne must stay on the cutting edge of technology. The company has received accolades from third parties like Gartner for its excellence in protection.', 'SentinelOne gets knocked for not being a profitable business. However, its quarterly cash burn has improved from $32 million to just $10 million over the past year, so free-cash-flow generation appears imminent. Additionally, SentinelOne has a sparkling balance sheet with zero debt and $925 million in cash. The company should be well into profitability by the time cash runs low.', ""That lack of profitability has put shares at a discount. Its most direct competitor, CrowdStrike Holdings, trades at over twice the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) SentinelOne does. That's fair today, but long-term investors who believe SentinelOne can balance growth and turn a profit could enjoy scooping up shares on the cheap. The stock's P/S ratio today is just 9, which was once over 100 when shares first went public."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Now, it operates under a consumption model instead, so customers only pay for what they use, giving them a faster sign-up process and more flexibility."", 'C3.ai warned investors the transition would lead to a temporary slowdown in revenue growth while it worked with customers to scale their spending under the new model. The chart below shows the drop in the growth rate throughout fiscal 2023.', ""However, as forecast by management, revenue growth is now reaccelerating. A record-high $78.4 million came through the door in Q3, marking an 18% increase -- the fastest growth in more than a year. According to C3.ai's financial models, it should continue to accelerate going forward."", ""Investors should be aware that C3.ai isn't yet profitable. The company lost $72.6 million in Q3, although that figure shrank to $15.8 million on a non-GAAP basis, which strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation. That, coupled with the slowdown in revenue growth, are the main reasons C3.ai stock is trading 83% below its all-time high that was set during the tech frenzy of 2020 (although it was heavily overvalued back then)."", 'C3.ai has over $723 million in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet, so it can continue to absorb non-GAAP losses of that size for years to come. However, the company will eventually have to prove to investors it can achieve profitability, and the consumption model should help by reducing customer acquisition costs.', 'With all of that said, C3.ai has an incredible amount of potential. CEO Thomas Siebel compares AI to the dawn of the internet and the smartphone, and Wall Street forecasts suggest the technology could add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.', 'C3.ai stock could deliver substantial upside if it captures even a fraction of that value. Plus, its business is on the upswing right now, which means this could be an ideal time to buy C3.ai shares.', 'Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon are all fantastic AI stocks to own, but investors looking to diversify away from those popular names might be glad they chose C3.ai in the long run.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?', 'Before you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and C3.ai wasn’t one of them.

Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs."", 'While a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion\'s share of the heavy lifting has been done by the ""Magnificent Seven.""', 'The Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', ""There are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%."", ""The second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:"", ""Microsoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's."", 'Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S.', ""Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year."", 'Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud).', ""Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter."", ""Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users."", ""Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."", ""But just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations."", 'Among the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.', 'Every publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.', ""But there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta."", 'As noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.', ""Investors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta."", ""Something that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks."", ""The cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028."", ""However, not all Magnificent Seven members are poised to be winners moving forward. The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia."", ""Don't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions."", ""Something else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power."", ""But there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds."", ""For example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace."", ""As I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers."", ""Regulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions."", ""Last but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend. This makes Nvidia a stock worth avoiding in April."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

But four continue to roar higher, suggesting they may take over and lead gains in the S&P 500. Will the ""Fab Four"" reign in 2024? Let\'s find out.', ""So first, let's identify these four flourishing stocks. They are, in order of performance starting from the best: Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft, and they've each climbed in the double digits since the beginning of the year."", 'AMZN data by YCharts.', ""They are among the five most heavily weighted stocks in the S&P 500, so if they gain, they could take the index along with them. This means you could benefit by investing directly in these stocks or by taking a position in a fund that tracks the index's performance, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust."", ""But could these stocks keep on climbing, or will they lose momentum like some of their Magnificent Seven peers? To answer the question, it's important to consider why the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced last year. As I mentioned, investors sought out growth stocks, especially those linked to hot technologies, and AI emerged more and more as the technology to favor. The AI market is forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and the technology may transform a variety of industries."", 'While all seven companies are investing in the area and could become AI winners, the Fab Four are particularly strong.', ""Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, holding 80% share, and thanks to that reported triple-digit earnings gains in the most recent quarter, reaching record levels. The company also is investing in research and development and just announced the upcoming release of the new Blackwell architecture and its most powerful chip ever. So, there's reason to be confident about Nvidia's growth ahead."", 'Meta says AI will be its biggest investment area this year, and the company aims to bring on board 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), a massive amount of computer power to advance its AI projects.', 'Amazon is using AI to cut costs and boost earnings at its e-commerce business, and the company is selling AI tools to others through its cloud unit -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- to help customers benefit from AI too.', 'Finally, Microsoft got in on AI early in the game, investing $1 billion in OpenAI, the creator of chatbot ChatGPT, back in 2019. Microsoft has become OpenAI\'s exclusive cloud provider and reportedly increased its investment to $13 billion. On top of this, the software giant has integrated AI across its own platforms and sees it as ""the defining technology of our time.""', 'All of this means, as investors continue to seek out potential AI winners, they might favor these companies that already have demonstrated their AI strengths and offer bright future prospects.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson. Please go ahead."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone, for joining our discussion today on the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schafer -- Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first 9 months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC service, as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter. While our new client volumes remained solid and in line, and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations, several factors, including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates, all combined to create headwind -- a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter. With the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post-pandemic era at Paychex. And I will tell you, I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients. And based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we saved over 300,000 small business jobs. While these pandemic era programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose, and that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic 4 years ago. We are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven recurring revenue growth formula still holds true in this post-pandemic and digitally driven era for the company. Focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy. We are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted adviser to small and midsized business owners. Despite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share and expanded operating margins due to our longstanding tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Our culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well. The macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small and midsized businesses. A tight job market for qualified workers, reduced access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation but, however, a relatively stable macro environment. The softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now. Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust, and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continued to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels. And both revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention remained at record levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. Our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact. The fundamentals of Paychex are sound. I'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value on our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. AI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients. Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences and their growing needs. Last month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy, including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics and AI-driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhance customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets. I want to thank -- thanks to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values. Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do and, more importantly, in my opinion, how we do it. We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors. I'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic era. We exit the -- this period in Paychex's history more focused and determined to be the digital -- digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, therefore, involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook. And as promised to many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that was impacted -- impacted the growth by about 300 basis points. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter. Operating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that is -- that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out. We were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter. And I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates. It's pretty much all margin. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38. I'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million. Total expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion, and our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively. I'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. And we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%. I'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty. We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter, and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation.I just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's passed the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31, and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4. And so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance that -- the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year. Management Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. Our guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Now let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter. We are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year. We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts, and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25. On a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25. And that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you. And then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25. We are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Okay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And we do have our first question from Mark Marcon with Baird.', 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""So ERTC, just one thing just to clarify, Bob. When you talked about that you sold it in February, but because of the legislation, you're going to end. It's basically bipartisan and it's basically going to end retroactively in January 1. So you then stopped recognizing the revenue. Did you -- is any ERTC revenue from -- that you sold from January 1 through February actually included in the third quarter number that you just reported?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. Everything that we sold and filed in the month of January, Mark, is included in the quarter, but nothing beyond January 31. So we continue to sell it in the month of February. I would say the faucet was still running steady in February on ERTC, and we made the decision not to recognize revenue around that just because there's so much uncertainty. And obviously, we're telling our clients that because of that level of uncertainty, if that bill does pass, we would not -- we would refund their monies for the service that we sold in the month of February. So we think it's the right decision from an accounting standpoint to stop recognizing revenue on it. And then I would just say, as we move forward in the month of February, that faucet has slowed to a drip on ERTC. Obviously, we're not focused on it, and it's -- there's probably a little bit that came in, in March, but that was probably stuff that we already had kind of in the queue that we were still processing. It's pretty much that program is over. And yes -- yes, go ahead."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', 'I mean, just related to the guide that you were providing, I was -- obviously, for the third quarter within Management Solutions because of the ERTC headwind, things were tougher. And it seems like you actually did see some acceleration ex ERTC on total revenue. So I was just wondering, is there any way to quantify the impact in terms of not recognizing that revenue in February just because, obviously, you were anticipating that coming in? So any thoughts there?', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I mean, high level, Mark, I mean, we provided guidance for the quarter. I think we -- you guys know what the guidance was that we provided for the quarter. The Q3 actually came in maybe about 100 basis points in that range lower than what we had said. And I would say probably 1/3 or a little bit more of that was related to the decision that we took on ERTC. So you could probably do the math on that and back in to get to a number that's close to the impact in February."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""Okay. Great. And then with regards to the margin expansion, obviously, that's very encouraging, especially when you're not getting that benefit from ERTC. What are the key drivers in terms of that? Is it the AI initiatives? Is it efficiency on the sales side? What's driving the margin expansion? And to -- how do you think -- to what extent do you think you're going to be able to continue that strong progress?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Mark, this is John here. Again, as you know, we pride ourselves in being the best operators in the industry and have the DNA of -- and we know the levers to pull as we see the type of trends that we see. So we've certainly done those, what I would say, typical things, but the deeper question you're asking is the right one. The fact of the matter is over the past 3 years, we've done a lot of investments as we've had the opportunity with the ERTC benefit to make a lot of investments in the business. We really focus that investment around our digitalization and digital adoption capabilities. We've built global capabilities in our operations footprint. And we started to really roll that out and really test and pilot that over the course of this fiscal year. And particularly during selling season, a lot of the enhancements both on the client service and retention side as well as the digital onboarding across each of our platforms, we launched a series of products that demonstrated to us at scale that we can drive stronger operational and sales efficiency in our model. And so we're going to continue to double down on that and continue to look for opportunities that we can drive digital transformation in our back office, drive digital adoption by our prospects and channel partners, clients and their employees. And we believe that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. That's what we've seen in these tests and pilots. And now we're really starting to push and roll that out at scale."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.', 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', ""On the execution, I guess, Bob, just would be for you, the '25 guidance preliminary, pretty helpful. Any sense of what type of macro environment you're factoring into that, I guess, from an employment perspective more broadly?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. Kevin, I mean, we're still going through and finalizing all of our assumptions. But I would say at this point in time, we would assume a fairly stable, steady macro environment. Obviously, there's an expectation that the Fed is going to start cutting rates later this year. We do have some of that factored in at this point in time. But I would say, overall, the assumption is a fairly steady state macro environment, with some expectation that there'll be rate cuts as we move into the fiscal year."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. I think, Kevin, I would just add on that on the macro side. We are adjusting our view and have adjusted our view even more as we looked at the third quarter based upon some of the hiring dynamics that we're seeing in the client base because there is somewhat of a disconnect when you look at an economy that's growing at 3% to 3.5%, high 2s, even if you go back and what you're seeing from a hiring perspective. And I would say the state of hiring in small businesses continues to be a challenge. I think it's a labor issue. It's not a demand issue. What we continue to see is clients telling us they're having trouble filling open positions and, quite frankly, with qualified candidates. I think one of the things that our HR professionals that are engaged, as you know, we have about 2.2 million of our client worksite employees under management by our HR team. So as we saw some of the trends we saw that were disconnected from our models in a 3% GDP economy, why weren't we seeing the hiring that we would have anticipated happening in the base. We had active structured dialogues with those clients, and what we're hearing is, is that they have open positions. They want to hire. They can't find qualified people. And I think they had been [firm] through the course of the pandemic in hiring just anyone. And so they're not willing to do that at the current labor rate. So the macro environment that we see, you look at our job index, continued moderation in hiring, continued moderation in wage inflation. We saw that January and February. I would say this December, January and February, if you look at our releases, continued to show moderation. And actually, January and February were the first 2 months in our index still over 100, still showing growth, but those were the first 2 months that we actually saw growth under pre-pandemic levels. And so stay tuned. Tomorrow, we'll release the March one, but what I would tell you is that what we see is a moderating economy. We see a stable economy. We don't see signs of a recession. We don't see all the other -- demand was strong. Our pipeline was strong. The other things that you would typically see that would be more recessionary, we're not seeing mass layoffs. We're not seeing layoffs across. What we're seeing is openings, vacancies, trouble hiring and businesses being cautious in who they're bringing into their workforce."", 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', ""Lot of sense. And then, John, just to follow up on that point. Is that -- is kind of that tight labor what's driving kind of the re-enrollment on the Insurance side of the PEO? Or just anything to call out in terms of what's been driving that?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""I think on the PEO enrollment, I want to really give credit to the team there. I think, as you recall, a year ago, a little over a year ago, this was a challenging area for us. We were seeing things. Participation rates weren't as high. Attachment wasn't as high. We really look at all aspects of both our product, our insurance product offerings, our enrollment processes and how we engage employees around that top to bottom. And we made some changes in both the product offerings we have as well as we approach clients and the employees in our insurance offerings in the PEO. And I think the team has done a good job there. And what we've seen is now we're back to at to slightly above attachment rates, and our participation rates are back to our historical norm. So I think that was a little bit more of an execution issue than any macro item."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""I wanted to ask on PEO. I know the commentary around sales retention and attach was quite strong, and then you moved into the low end. I'm just curious if maybe you can elaborate on that and maybe your initial thinking around PEO momentum going into next year as well because I know that was something that we were tracking."", 'John B. Gibson', 'Yes. You want me to -- go ahead.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes -- go ahead. So I'll just start with the -- no, no, no. So I'd say the big driver of maybe guiding more towards the lower end of the range was with the employment headwinds that John called out in the script. We continue to see moderation in employment, and that really was across the board. For the most part, the PEO has been able to outrun it with strong execution, both in sales retention. We mentioned we continued to see record levels of worksite employee retention. Really strong worksite employee growth in that business. And then really getting our medical insurance attachment and volumes back to where we see it. So it's really a little bit of the macro headwind. And the other thing I'll call out on the PEO, I think the print is strong at 8%. But as you guys know, that category is PEO and Insurance, and Insurance is typically dilutive to the growth of that overall category. So I would say that the PEO standalone growth is north of that number, obviously, that we gave you. So really strong performance in the PEO business. And we're building momentum, and we see that carrying into next year. I'm not ready to give splits on next year between Management Solutions and the PEO, but we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance to grow at a faster overall rate than the total revenue growth that I gave you."", 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Got it. Okay. Very clear. So it's just really the employment side that's out of your control. Perfect. So my quick follow-up, just on the pricing front among the 3 factors. You mentioned pricing last. Any more color on the pricing? Is it more discounting that you're seeing? And I'm curious if that informs your typical price action that you would take in the May or the spring time frame. And if that's baked into your look-ahead or preliminary '25 outlook."", 'John B. Gibson', ""That is a broad question. So if I missed something, you come back, Tien-Tsin. But here's what I would say. We're still able to go into the market and command our traditional value-based pricing for the value we provide. I think you can see that in the retention. And what I would tell you is, again, and I'll be so glad when I don't have to use this word again, which I think will probably be 12 months from now, ex ERTC. When I look at our actual revenue per client was ERTC was in a lot of the pricing bundles that we would sell when you're looking at the data is we're actually seeing that the pricing that we're getting across the various product groups being on par to what we have seen historically. I would remind you that over the last 3 years, we have guided and have said what's been at the high end of our traditional range. And I think that our assumption is as we go into the post-pandemic era that we're going to -- like everything else seems to be going back to the mean to slightly higher. So when I look at retention, again, retention back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, but slightly better. I think that's where you'll see pricing, and we still feel good about where we can go in terms of pricing. I think the competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I think there were 2 dynamics going on that were interesting to me when I looked at the data. And again, when I'm looking across our 401(k) business, our PEO business, our HCM mid-market business, our small business HCM business, our SurePayroll business, I just -- when I go across our insurance business, the broad set of businesses and look at the third quarter, which is one of our largest volume quarters, and I see the volume hold up to what I expected. But what was interesting, the average client size was down in almost all of those slightly, which impacts our realized price, right? You just have less employees, you have less checks. And what I sense is, is that they're in the -- if you think of our business, boulders, rocks and pebbles, right? I think boulders have been harder to move. Less decision. You've heard some other competitors that are more targeted in the upper end of the market talk about extended decision time frames, et cetera. So while we got the volume we expected, we got a little more rocks and pebbles than we expected, which drove a little bit of the rate. And then it was a more competitive environment in terms of both clients from a retention perspective and from a purchase perspective, demanding more and, I would say, being a little more negotiative in their approach, which is kind of what you sense in the economy with high inflation."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.', 'Bryan C. Bergin', 'I wanted to just dig in a bit more on bookings. Can you just talk about how the third quarter bookings came in relative to your expectations? How 4Q is trending so far? And if you can, give us some added color across client size, PEO versus ASO as well.', 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Bryan, I would just probably reiterate what I've kind of already said. We had solid demand for our solutions really across the board. Volumes were in line with our expectations. What I said before is across each one of those sectors, I would say that the average size of the deal that we landed was smaller than what we anticipated than typical. So -- and I'm talking small, small amounts of differences. But as you all know, in a business of our scale, a small change going from average 1 or 2 employees or 3 or 4 employees or worksite employees per deal, it can have an impact on the revenue you expect."", 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""Okay. Understood. And then just on the sales front and sales investment, I guess, can you give us a sense on how sales headcount has trended relative to the start of the year? And as you go forward and plan for '25, how are you thinking about adding absolute sales headcount versus trying to lean on more tech investments to drive more productivity?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Bryan, I would say this, our sales headcount has been at our expectations through the year. When we went into the selling season, we were at headcount. That's what we reported. I think to your point, we -- what was interesting in the third quarter, when I look holistically across the business, the amount of business we drove digitally across each of the platforms was impressive. And that's approaching some of our other channels that have historically been Paychex's bedrock of where we've gotten business. And so what we're seeing is and what we're doing with digital, I think, will continue to be something. And we're looking at a lot of different go-to-market strategies that we think will drive more productivity in our sales reps. And I think what we're trying to do right now is make sure we're doing the proper territory management, so that we can have even more reps more productive. So I'm not prepared -- we're still working through our final budget planning process. What I can tell you is that we're driving a lot of productivity on a per rep basis. And we're going to make sure that we're covering every nook and cranny of the market. So making sure how many salespeople do we actually need to go after the market opportunity we have in each of the segments. And I think getting more specific about segment sizes and product type is what we're focused on as part of our new go-to-market strategy going into this post-pandemic era."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies.', 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""So maybe, first, we'd heard about maybe pricing increases going into effect, let's call it, either towards the end of the year or earlier this year. I was just curious if there is a change in the timing of when you push through price increases for customers this year? And then I have a follow-up question as well."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I'll take the first question. Yes. No change to the amount. I mean, I think your timing, it's not always the exact time every year, but it's in that range, typically towards the ended the fiscal year. Beginning in the next fiscal year is typically when we have our annual price increases. So really no change to the timing there."", 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""Okay. Great. And then I guess, just as you think about segmenting by customer size, I know what you just said about the average deal size, comparing it being smaller. But are you seeing any trends within if you stratified it by your smallest customers versus maybe slightly more like mid-market? And then same question between Management Solutions and PEO, if we're seeing anything that's different by the type of customer that you're seeing in terms of behavior or deal size or deal closing times."", 'John B. Gibson', ""No. So I don't really see much change overall. What I would say is, and part of this I'm reading what I hear others have said, that play in markets and when I look at our -- by deal size. So we've got a mid-market team, we've got a PEO team. They're out in the market outside the base. And they're going after deals, and they're getting an average deal size. And we'll get a mix. We'll get this number of clients over 1,000 employees, as many 500 to 999. You get to drill, right? And on average, you just -- you get a mix, and that's the mix that kind of holds in the marketplace kind of historically. What I think you see when I look across it, and Bob can comment as well, is that on the larger side, the larger end, the enterprise end of that market, there was less of those deals that came in, in the PEO, came in, in the ASO and came in, in the traditional HCM. And we made up the volume in more slightly average size deals that we get. But then when you add that all together, because you have less boulders to the mix, you have a little less, either worksite employees or less checks than you planned on. Does that make sense?"", 'Samad Saleem Samana', ""I'm going to break -- it does. I'm going to squeeze one more. And I know 2 are normally the limit. But just is there -- I know you're not guiding by segment for next year, but is there any reason, Bob, to assume that the trend line that you've guided for, for next quarter for Management Solutions ex ERTC and PEO, what's implied in the guide that, that wouldn't be the trend line heading into next year? I guess, is there anything that would materially get you off of those trend lines?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I mean, I wouldn't say significantly, Samad. I mean, I don't want to get into providing specifics on the 2 categories yet, as we're still going through our annual budget process. But we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance category growth next year to be similar to what we've seen this year. And Management Solutions is where the big headwind is with ERTC. But I would say similar trend lines to where we're exiting the year."", 'Operator', 'We have our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is Caroline. I am on for Jason. So in terms of capital deployment heading into 4Q and also 2025, can you give an update on the relative attractiveness of buybacks versus M&A? And then also, could you give an update on the general health of your M&A pipeline?', 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Look, I would say that we continue to be open to acquisitions that meet the strategic objectives that we've laid out and that make financially sense. I would say that I feel like in several areas and industries that we have interest, that the multiples that I've seen are getting into line that are more reasonable and trying to be active. And the key thing is just the timing of that, when is the right time of that. So we're certainly open for business, active engaging in both tuck-ins where we can add capability. We're doing a lot of things and looking at what we can do from an AI and digital HR perspective, constantly looking for adjacencies that are driving really the needs of our customers in terms of what they need to succeed and what we've talked about, the access to capital, being able to retain it and hire employees, and really getting access to affordable benefits that allow them to attract clients. So all of those things are open. We've got an active engaged team that is talking to a lot of different prospects. But more to come. We certainly have the capital capability and the ability to do acquisitions, and we're prepared to pull the trigger if we can come across something that makes financial sense."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""And Caroline, I mean, the only thing I would add to that, just overall as it relates to capital allocation, really, no change in our approach there. We're going to continue to invest in the business. Dividends are -- we're going to continue to grow the dividend, and that will continue to be our primary use of cash. You mentioned share repurchases, really, no change in our philosophy there. We do that to offset dilution from executive comp. You saw recently, a month or so ago, we did do a new share reauthorization, so we can continue to do that. The old authorization had expired. And then to John's point, we certainly are interested in M&A opportunistically, and we'll continue to use M&A to drive growth in the business. So our strategy and philosophy around capital allocation is very consistent with what you are all used to in the past."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', ""I wanted to go back on just a quick couple macro points that you're making. If I rewind back in December, you talked a little bit about some concerns you had about potential for increases in out-of-business rates, et cetera. I'm just wondering, how that's evolved and what your current outlook is there? And it seems like you feel better about it, but I just want to make sure I'm interpreting your comments correctly."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Jim, I would say that out-of-business rates are not out of the norm that you would expect given the accelerated new business starts that we saw 2 to 3 years ago. Small business starts are down a little bit from those peaks and highs, but still above pre-pandemic levels. But again, it goes back to what I said before. We're not seeing signs of what would typically be seen in a recessionary period where there was accelerated out of businesses. Right now, what I would say out-of-business is elevated and particularly in the low end. But when you look at that in context of how many new businesses were started over the last 3 years, that's not atypical because within 2 years, 50% are gone. Within 5 years, 75% of them are gone. So that's -- it's not being driven by, what I would say, economic hardship or broad-based. Businesses that you would not expect to go out of business don't seem to be going out of business, if that makes sense."", 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Yes, it does make sense. I appreciate that. And then you -- we've talked about kind of labor scarcity pretty consistently for the last few years. And I think your incremental comments in terms of the quality of labor and specifically employers being more discerning now is interesting. Any specific areas or whether it be industries or geographic regions that that's important, too? And I'm asking the question because I'm trying to think about what the path to resolution there is or if this is just something we're perpetually going to be grappling with."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Well, look, what we keep trying to focus ourselves on is what more can we do to help our clients retain and attract quality employees. It's in their interest. It's certainly in our interest given the way we get paid. I think, as you know, we launched 2 years ago the AI-based Retention Insights product that gives them insights to where they may have retention risk. We've got this -- the partnership with Indeed that's fully integrated, and we're actually elevating their job postings up in the listings for them as part of that partnership. We're -- we just did the Visier product, which is on the way to being launched. We'll give them compensation information to be done. We're going to be doing some things in the next fiscal year around creating benefit bundles for our non-insurance HCM clients that allow their employees to feel like being part of that employee relationship, give them access to catastrophic care. We're trying to do a lot of things to solve this problem for our clients. And obviously, there's more we need to do because the simple fact is we have a generational change happening in the labor force. Participation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, and it's going to be very difficult given the rate of retirements that we're seeing in Baby Boomers to really see that change. And what you see in the prime age workers were actually at record highs. The problem is there's not enough prime age people to fill all the opportunities. And then when you look at the productivity gap that you have generationally, and that's just in terms of experience. I don't want to disparage any generations in any way. But just the fact you're replacing someone with years of experience with someone that's newly experienced, I really think this is going to be an ongoing public policy issue that's going to have to be addressed. There's a lot of retraining with AI and digital jobs. I think more needs to be done. I mean, we got this -- we got the R&D tax credit thing sitting out there. Not to get on political bandwagon here, but we need to do more to allow businesses to invest in productivity and drive productivity enhancements, and that's not going to replace workers. That's going to enable them to get the work done with less workers that are going to exist in the marketplace. So I think this is a systemic problem. I think it's a great opportunity for us because it really goes to the products and services that we offer for a small and medium-sized business owner. So that's kind of my personal view on it, and it continues to show up in the data that we look at."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""How much did M&A contribute in the quarter? And if you could help us think through whether there's an inorganic contribution when it comes to your preliminary F '25 guidance, what that might be as well."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. Ramsey, I mean, M&A, we didn't do any new M&A. The only M&A that we've done this year was the small Alterna acquisition that we did at the end of Q1. Obviously, it contributes something. It's a small number. It doesn't even round to 1%. So it's really not a big contributor at all. In the guide, we typically don't -- although we're always active in looking for opportunities, we're not going to put anything into a forecast until a deal is closed. So that does not assume any -- the preliminary guide does not assume any level of M&A next year."", 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""Got it, got it. One quick follow-up for me. SECURE Act 2.0, what are you seeing there? Does that have the potential to emerge as kind of a tailwind that might help offset some of the ERTC headwind? Or is it too early to tell? Maybe give us an update on what you're seeing on SECURE Act 2.0."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. I think, Ramsey, replacing ERTC is a very difficult thing to do, both in terms of the revenue nature of it and the profitability of it. And I would say that helping -- and basically, we're doing filing, as you know. We were doing tax filings, which is something that's core to our business. And there was a lot of hype around ERTC. So there was a lot of education going on by others that was helping that. What I see in secured -- the SECURE Act is I think it's a great thing. I mean, our retirement business had a solid quarter and it's had solid year-to-date. And that continues to be a strong growth driver. I think you've still got to talk to business owners and educate them on it. It's still a sales process. We've had states that have made it mandatory. Those kind of come and go in the area. The other thing on the SECURE Act 2.0, which we've been pushing on, is there is a little bit of a loophole that kind of disadvantages businesses with under 10 employees. I won't get into the nuances of it. And there's pretty bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to try to close that loophole, and we keep pushing for that because I do think that would particularly help in our micro segment, really accelerate some adoption there. But right now, that will pull us. It's still there."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.', 'David Paige Papadogonas', ""This is David Paige on for Ashish. I just had a question on your AI initiatives. Maybe can you provide some of the customer feedback, what -- I guess, what parts of your tools or your AI models that they're liking and maybe some of the benefits you're seeing internally in terms of greater sales teams, productivity, et cetera?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. So David, what I would tell you at this point in time, a lot of our AI initiatives and investments have really been focused internally, both in terms of how we drive efficiency, how we drive better sales productivity, how we do better marketing and targeting, how we do better customer service and identify clients that are at risk, how we do better pricing and discounting, so that we're not getting too much away, but we're giving enough to get the right type of lifetime value that we want. Really, on the client side, the Retention Insights has been a very popular product with our larger customers in terms of getting insights to what they're doing. And we're just in the stages of really rolling out our Visier product, which will give them basically 750 million data -- compensation data points that will allow our customers in real time to understand how competitive they are, if they're making a job offer what they could potentially do. And that's just in the early stages. What I believe is because of our vast data set, we're going to be able to provide a degree of insights and information when coupled with our HR advisers that I truly think is going to set us apart from any of the smaller regional players or a local CPA because we're just going to be able to give them the vast data set insights that we have. And so as I've mentioned, we just hired a new SVP whose full-time job is to do nothing, but pull all of the capabilities we have across the company and develop a robust strategy of how we can drive the most out of AI to drive more value for our customers and drive more operational efficiency into the company."", 'Operator', 'And we have our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.', 'Bryan Connell Keane', ""I just had a couple of clarifications. The miss on revenue in third quarter versus your guided expectations, it sounded like 1/3 of that was the ERTC decision to stop recognizing the revenues. Then I'm just trying to fill in the gap, and the other 2/3 of kind of versus your expectations on the miss, if I heard that correctly."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes, that's right. Bryan, so it's roughly -- there's 3 big drivers -- there are 3 drivers that we've talked about. They're all small, but there's 3 drivers that we've talked about. Certainly, the continued moderation of employment. We definitely saw lower checks per client, lower change in base relative to what our assumptions were. That started in Q2. We updated our forecast in Q2 for some of the trends that we are seeing. But I would say employment came in a little bit softer than even our revised assumptions in the forecast. And then John mentioned a little bit on the rate. We saw smaller client sizes maybe a little bit higher discounting than what we assumed. I mean, we're still getting really good price realization overall and strong growth in revenue per client. But I would say it was a little bit softer relative to what our forecast assumptions were. And then the bigger piece there was the ERTC that I mentioned. So when you look at those 3 things, they're roughly 1/3 a piece is how I would characterize it."", 'Bryan Connell Keane', ""No. That's helpful. And then when I jump from the third quarter revenue growth of 4% to the guided 5%, what accounts for the extra -- the strength of 100 basis points when I go into the fourth quarter?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. So I'd say there's a few things to call out there, Bryan. One, the -- I mentioned the ERTC headwind being similar to Q3. It's a little bit less than it was in Q3, so that has a little bit of an impact. You have less of a headwind from ERTC in Q4. We're still getting strong client base, price realization, product penetration that carries into Q4. And then I would say on the PEO side, we came out of selling season in a stronger position from a worksite employee standpoint in medical enrollment. And so we're going to get the full quarter benefit of that in Q4 relative to where we were in Q3. So we got positive momentum, I would say, heading into Q4 in both businesses. And then we are getting a little bit of a lift in interest on funds in Q4. You've seen a little bit stronger growth there versus Q3. Some of that is the compare we did some repositioning of the portfolio. I think we had some realized losses that we took in Q4 to better position the portfolio going forward. And so you get a little bit of a tailwind in growth from that as well. And I'd say when you put those together, that's what accounts for a little bit stronger growth in Q4 relative to Q3."", 'Operator', 'And we have our last question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', 'Just one for me. Wanted to go back to the expense and margin side. I mean, the outperformance, I think, was notable despite the ERTC revenue going away. And I just wanted to clarify. And I know you talked about some of the efficiencies off of the investments over the last few years. But were there any specific actions on the expense side that you took during the quarter as the ERTC revenue sort of wound down?', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I wouldn't say anything specific to call out, Scott. I mean, obviously, we're always trying to look at expenses and making sure that we're not letting new costs into the business and really focusing. We saw the headwind come in, so I wouldn't say there's anything specific to call out other than good expense management. And there -- some of that margin expansion that you saw in the quarter is being driven by interest rates. But even when you exclude that, we saw good margin expansion during the quarter."", 'John B. Gibson', 'Yes. I don\'t want to shortchange the tremendous job that each and every employee does in the company in terms of managing expenses. And we have it built into our DNA when we say, ""Hey, we\'re seeing signs. It\'s time to go."" People know what to do, and they do it. Because, again, as Bob pointed out, some of that PEO and Insurance revenue is direct revenue pass-through. So when you look at our margins, you think some of that revenue, and you\'ll lose in the ERTC, I just want to commend how good a job we\'ve done and, I think, have done historically as part of our just DNA as being the best operators. And so it\'s every little bit, every little thing matters. And so there\'s no one big thing. I would say that the insights that we\'re gaining and the opportunity for digitalization, the investment we\'ve made in enabling our clients and their employees to engage our systems and the rate in which they\'re adopting that opportunity is tremendous. And we\'ve invested over the last several years into building out both our AI robotics capabilities and our global footprint. And I think all of those investments we\'ve made over the last 3 years during the pandemic era when we had ERTC are going to serve us well as we move forward. So I just look at it and say, as we exit this era of the pandemic from a Paychex perspective, I think we\'re entering the new era of just fundamentally a better positioned company. I think we\'re a more positioned, trusted adviser to small businesses. We\'re delivering more value to our customers. They\'re rewarding that with retention and with better pricing in a market where there\'s a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. We\'re more digitally enabled in all aspects of our business than we\'ve ever been. And I think we\'re more agile and focused and also more profitable, quite honestly. So hats off to the team for all the things we\'ve done to get ourselves in this position that when the tide turned, we had leverage we could pull to make sure that we\'re delivering for our shareholders.Is that it, Mike?', 'Operator', 'And that does conclude our Q&A session for today.', 'John B. Gibson', ""Okay. Well, listen, everyone, at this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of the conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. And I want to thank you for your interest in Paychex, and hope all of you have a great day. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

Over the past three months, it has gained 22.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 15.3%.PH currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Let’s delve into the factors that have been aiding the firm for a while now.End-Market Strength: Parker-Hannifin’s Aerospace Systems segment has been benefiting from strong momentum in its commercial aftermarket business aided by steady demand across end markets. Strength in the company’s Meggitt business has also been supporting the segment. Management expects the Aerospace Systems segment’s sales to increase approximately 19.5-21.5% and organic sales to rise approximately 12% in fiscal 2024 (ending June 2024).Business Strategy: The company has been gaining from its unique Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning and distribution growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended December 2023), PH’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 330 basis points year over year to 25.7%. Also, its effective pricing and supply-chain management actions have been helping it tackle challenges related to the supply chain and higher costs for a while.Acquisition Benefits: Parker-Hannifin remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. In September 2022, the company acquired Meggitt plc, a global leader in motion and control technologies. The acquisition expanded Parker-Hannifin’s presence in the UK, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft, and aero-engine components and systems.

110,4e10cea1-4d47-3193-a448-b3f919cbb0b5,NFLX,2024-04-03,Why Bob Iger’s strategy for the next decade of growth at Disney promises a magic carpet ride for the Magic Kingdom’s future,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bob-iger-strategy-next-124735944.html,1712062055,STORY,"['DIS', 'NFLX']","['As the heated proxy fight between activist investor Nelson Peltz and Disney’s board reaches its grand finale this week, it’s easy to forget that amidst the gripping drama of the fight for control of Disney, and a fusillade of personal barbs from both sides, the proxy fight is nothing more than a time-consuming distraction for CEO Bob Iger, who is running Disney at a time when the entire traditional media and entertainment industry is under siege with an unprecedented array of competitive threats from Big Tech and its disruption.', 'Already, we have shown how, in terms of their past performance, Peltz and Disney CEO Bob Iger could not be more different. While Peltz is one of the chronically poorest-performing activist investors, with a long history of destroying value when he sits on boards, Iger has towered over media peers in stock performance across his two stints as CEO, generating over $160 billion in shareholder value, with Disney being the top-performing stock on the Dow this year.', 'Looking beyond past performance, and towards the future of Disney, Iger is doing more than keeping the lights on: he is pulling off one of the most remarkable turnaround and transformation stories in media and entertainment history. A close look at Bob Iger’s strategic roadmap for the next decade of growth across business lines at Disney clearly shows that if there is any traditional media company that will emerge from the streaming era with even greater profitability than its traditional linear and cable businesses ever achieved, it will be Disney.', 'Over a decade ago, Bob Iger was one of the first media executives to see the decline of the traditional “linear bundle” coming. Observers not steeped in the media business may not understand just how lucrative the linear bundle was for traditional media companies, as they raked in windfall advertising revenue from advertisers on top of “carriage fees” for providing content to cable customers. But with the popularization of streaming and subsequent cord-cutting, more customers are canceling their cable TV packages, which leads many media analysts to believe that the linear bundle business model is now in secular decline.', 'Unlike some of his media industry peers who were disrupted and caught off balance, Iger sought to be a disruptor, proactively preparing for a world where the linear business is not as strong as it used to be, and leaning into the cable-to-streaming migration early on. When Iger launched the flagship Disney+ streaming service in 2019, although a chorus of critics said at the time that Disney could never successfully launch a streaming platform, 10 million subscribers signed up on the first day alone, and 100 million within the first 15 months before Iger left office.', 'Iger had already been preparing for its launch for years, buying a stake in streaming tech company BAMTech in 2017. As a result of Iger’s vision and prescience, Disney is way ahead of traditional media peers in bridging the linear-to-streaming transition, with its streaming business driving billions more in revenue than any of its legacy competitors. Furthermore, Disney’s streaming platforms boast a total subscriber count greater than all its traditional media peers combined, with 190 million global subscribers across the Disney streaming platforms (compared to less than 100 million for Max run by Warner Brothers Discovery; ~60 million on Paramount+, and ~30 million on Peacock, run by Comcast’s NBC Universal; and dwarfing the 25 million subscribers of the much-ballyhooed Apple TV).', 'While Netflix remains in the lead with ~250 million subscribers, Disney is making fast progress, with even Netflix acknowledging that “it will be….the two of us duking it out for a long time.”', 'Disney possesses many significant advantages that Netflix does not have, including a deeper historical library and more timeless franchises with synergies across consumer products and parks and resorts, as well as pure scale–despite vastly divergent stock market valuations.', 'Disney’s total net income surpassed that of Netflix’s last year, with a revenue base three times larger. Not to mention Disney’s creative engine, when working at full force, remains unparalleled: Some may be surprised to know that in 2023, the first full year of Iger’s return, six of the top 10 most streamed movies across all streaming platforms in the U.S. belonged to Disney.', 'Despite Disney’s success in signing up subscribers, many analysts fear that the monetization opportunities from the streaming era will never catch up to the windfall profits historically reaped by media and entertainment companies from the traditional linear/cable bundle–and that revenue growth will be hard to drive moving forward amidst shrinking profit margins. But it may be too early to ring the death knell of media and entertainment profitability. It’s clear that the streaming business is still in its earliest innings of development. Indeed, Iger is the first to acknowledge that streaming is still a “nascent” business for Disney, merely four years old, and that Disney is still learning in real time and making in-game adjustments.', 'Already, Iger has overseen dramatic improvements in Disney’s streaming business–including reducing expenses and scaling the pricing structure appropriately–to build the streaming platforms toward long-term growth and profitability. As a result, the streaming business has inflected from generating $2 billion a year in losses when it started in 2019 to full profitability this year. Iger has managed the growth of the streaming platforms responsibly, far outpacing the decline of the linear business, without falling into the self-destructive streaming arms-race war that his predecessor Bob Chapek fell into, cannibalizing the rest of the company and wrestling control out of the hands of creative officials into the hands of hand-picked deputy Kareem Daniel to fill Disney+ with too much poor quality content nobody wanted to watch.', 'However, there are abundant massive untapped opportunities for Disney to accelerate not only subscriber growth but also revenue and margin growth. In many public interviews, Iger has identified streaming advertising revenue as an area where there is potential for exponential growth, especially with more personalized and targeted digital advertising which is far more valuable to advertisers than the old model of generic ads on linear TV. Growth in streaming advertising revenue could really accelerate if Disney continues to widen the pricing gap between its ad-free and ad-supported streaming subscriptions, as virtually all its competitors have done. It is surprising that Disney still has the single cheapest ad-free streaming monthly subscription across its peer competitors, with the $13.99 Disney+ ad-free subscription cheaper than Netflix’s $15.49 ad-free subscription and cheaper than Max’s $15.99 ad-free subscription. It is also surprising that Disney does not have a premium tier, while competitors such as Netflix rake in profits from its $22.99 premium version and Max’s $19.99 premium version. At least on paper, Disney has considerable room to raise prices on its ad-free subscription. Raising prices does not have to hurt accessibility and affordability: The ad-supported subscription tier of Disney+ at $7.99 remains highly affordable for consumers and highly accretive to Disney’s advertising revenue.', 'There are also untapped opportunities from the planned full integration of Hulu with Disney’s fully-owned streaming platforms, Disney+ and ESPN+, later this year, once Disney closes on its agreement to purchase full ownership in Hulu from Comcast.', 'That Disney even owns Hulu to begin with is a testament to Iger’s prescience. Had Iger not purchased 21st Century Fox from Rupert Murdoch in 2018, Comcast would have bought Fox, with Hulu as a part of Fox, and Comcast would very likely be leading Disney in streaming today rather than trailing far behind with only ~30 million subscribers on Peacock, less than a sixth of Disney’s subscriber count. Perhaps the most compelling critique of Iger’s Fox deal is that maybe he ought to have pursued an acquisition of Time Warner from its legendary CEO Jeff Bewkes in lieu of 21st Century Fox, as the Time Warner assets including HBO, and the Warner Bros. content library, might have been a better match with Disney’s brand family.', 'Another underappreciated opportunity arises simply from the gradual maturation of the nascent streaming industry. The days of streaming arms-wars, with streaming losses totaling over $10 billion in 2022 across traditional media companies, are likely over amidst more disciplined content creation and spending. And while Big Tech companies continue to loom large with forays into the media and entertainment business, many of their streaming platforms are hardly getting off the ground, hamstrung by a lack of access to content. Thanks to the unfavorable antitrust regulatory climate, it is hard to see how they will be able to purchase the content libraries they so desperately need through inorganic mergers and acquisitions, providing significant competitive advantages to Disney alongside Netflix with their leading streaming platforms.', 'Iger has managed to navigate the streaming revolution in a way that genuinely bridges the transition from linear and allows the linear businesses to continue to flourish, as a best-of-both-worlds scenario.', 'Although the linear business model is under severe strain, Disney’s ABC and ABC-owned television stations continue to bring in healthy revenues and profits, and there is some revenue growth potential should the market for linear advertising recover to more normalized levels, as many expect it will, especially with a presidential election (and related advertising spending) looming this fall.', 'Iger has smartly refused to sell at depressed prices, despite an abundance of offers from prospective buyers, while focusing on bringing down costs, with a large chunk of Disney’s $7.5 billion in cost savings coming out of linear. Iger is also streamlining the linear business to focus on core channels, cutting down on tertiary channels with lesser economics and viability moving forward.', 'Disney’s recent negotiations with Charter provided a win-win blueprint for how Disney can continue to support the traditional linear business model while also bridging the gap to streaming smoothly, with Disney providing discounted ad-supported Disney+ streaming subscriptions to Charter customers at wholesale rates, providing cable customers an easy and affordable streaming option to complement their existing cable subscription.', 'During Bob Iger’s first term as CEO, Disney produced eight of the top 10, and 13 of the top 20, biggest box office openings of all time, all of which crossed $1 billion in box office revenues. In contrast, Bob Chapek produced zero films crossing $1 billion.', 'Unlike Chapek, who centralized authority and alienated creative talent with high-profile spats, Iger understands that Disney at its core is a storytelling company–and knows how to make good movies.', 'As a part of that, Iger has prioritized focusing on quality over quantity. As he candidly said, “Volume sometimes can be detrimental to quality. And in our zeal to greatly increase volume, some of our studios lost a little focus. So the first step we’ve taken is we’ve reduced volume. We’ve reduced output, particularly at Marvel”.', 'The top line numbers across Disney Experiences, including its prized parks & resorts, speak for themselves: Not only are new attendance records being set continually, with attendance twice what it was before the pandemic domestically, but 2023 represented all-time records in revenue, operating income, and operating margin.', 'Even more importantly, Iger recognizes the essential importance of parks and resorts to the Disney brand and to families across the world, moderating the draconian and unpopular consumer price increases seen under his predecessor Chapek, who used price hikes at parks as the cookie jar to backfill streaming losses.', 'Instead of cannibalizing parks and resorts to fund pet projects, Iger is investing in both growth and affordability, and his plans to invest $60 billion in continued growth over the next decade reflects the fact that parks and resorts have seen some of the highest returns on invested capital across any business line at Disney over the last decade–and is one of the few business lines which are impervious to competition from Big Tech companies.', 'As Iger likes to quip, “Sports continues to stand tall in a sea of tremendous choice” within entertainment, and Iger has committed to Disney’s future in sports by building out ESPN as the single leading digital sports platform.', 'New add-ons such as ESPN Bets reflect this vision, but this is only the tip of the iceberg: The launch of the immersive flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product next year is expected to include integrated betting, fantasy, shopping, statistics, and customization and personalization designed to appeal to every sports fan, from casual followers to die-hards. Iger has smartly resisted bringing in strategic partners with questionable value-add or selling off ESPN on the cheap.', 'Furthermore, Disney’s new sports joint venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery is off to a strong start with the appointment of veteran Apple executive Pete Distad as its head. The bundling of sports content will not only alleviate existing customer frustrations but also tap into a massive growth market. After all, of 125 million households in America, more than 60 million are not in the traditional bundled cable ecosystem, and desperately searching for a way to watch more of the sports they want, on a single platform.', 'Disney has already found that churn rates are down significantly wherever “bundled” packages are available, so it stands to reason that further bundling will take place across streaming services and with cable customers to ensure a less confusing customer experience across the board.', 'The legendary Disney flywheel–as drawn up by Walt Disney himself–is constantly expanding, with each new business line building off and contributing to the momentum of complimentary adjacent business lines. Iger has never been afraid to take bold leaps to expand the flywheel, with masterstrokes such as Disney’s new $1.5 billion investment in video game maker Epic Games. Millennials spend as much time gaming as they do watching TV or movies, and video games represent not only a high-margin additional business for Disney, they are natural add-ons to enhance the value and depth of Disney’s existing brand-name franchises, in particular Marvel and Star Wars. ', 'Iger’s compelling vision for the future is why even other activist investors–such as the savvy, constructive Mason Morfit of ValueAct, who was up 46% last year–have come out in strong support of the Disney CEO.', 'Iger’s track record at Disney cannot be ignored–but he is not caught up in the past. Rather, while media analysts wring their hands on the sidelines and complain that the golden days of media and entertainment companies are over, that revenue growth will never return, or that streaming will never bring the profits that the linear bundle once did, Iger has built a thoroughly novel vision and an innovative blueprint for what a modern entertainment company should look like.', 'Film critic Roger Ebert once quipped, “No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough!” Bob Iger’s careful growth plans across business lines will ensure that the Magic Kingdom continues on the magic carpet ride which has defined his tenure as CEO of Disney for many years to come.', 'Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Founder and President of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. In 2023, he was named “Management Professor of the Year” by Poets & Quants magazine.', 'Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute and a former quantitative investment analyst with the Rockefeller Family Office.', 'Glassdoor CEO: ‘Anonymous posts will always stay anonymous’', 'We analyzed 46 years of consumer sentiment data–and found that\xa0today’s ‘vibecession’ is just men\xa0starting to feel as bad about the economy as women historically have', 'Housing market data suggests\xa0the most optimistic buyers during the pandemic\xa0are more likely to stop paying their mortgages', 'Intel CEO: ‘Our goal is to have at least 50% of the world’s advanced semiconductors produced in the U.S. and Europe by the end of the decade’', 'The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of\xa0Fortune.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

All because of obesity data from a competitor. But that pullback wouldn’t last long. In fact, by March 26, the stock soared more than $12 a share on promising new weight loss data on its oral weight loss treatment.', 'Plus, there was news\xa0Viking now plans to start Phase 2 trials of its once-a-day weight loss pill later this year.\xa0As noted by CNBC, “The phase one trial for the pill followed more than 40 patients with obesity for around a month. Those people took different dose sizes of the drug or received a placebo. Viking said patients who received the pill once a day lost up to 5.3% of their weight on average, or up to 3.3% more than those who took a placebo, at 28 days.”', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Even better, Viking Therapeutics could easily see even more upside. Its injectable and oral treatment trials continue to show blockbuster potential. But it’s not just VKTX we like on dips. Here are three biotech stocks to buy today.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'Let’s start out with\xa0Amgen\xa0(NASDAQ:AMGN), a $151 billion biopharma with plenty of near-term upside potential. After plummeting from about $325 to a recent low of $270, the AMGN stock is just starting to pivot higher. From its last traded price of $281.77, I’d like to see it refill its bearish gap around $325 again near term.', 'Helping, the company wants to jump into the obesity drug boom.', 'As noted by CNBC,\xa0AMGN is testing an injectable\xa0that helps people lose weight differently from current injections from Eli Lilly, for example. Amgen’s treatment, MariTide, is being tested as a once-a-month or even less frequent injectable.', 'Better, Goldman Sachs just upgraded the stock to a Conviction Buy with a $350 target. “The analyst believes Amgen is well positioned to add multi-billion-dollar opportunities to its portfolio through a robust pipeline of drugs in development — many of which have key clinical trial read-outs in 2024,”\xa0as noted by TheFly.com.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Romix Image', 'Another one of the top biotech stocks to buy on a dip is\xa0Pyxis Oncology\xa0(NASDAQ:PYXS).', 'After rallying from a low of about $1.50 to $6.79, the stock slipped to $3.83 in recent days. However, we expect for the biotech that creates antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) drugs to trade significantly higher from its current price.', 'For one, remember, according to\xa0Pfizer\xa0(NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla, “Antibody-drug conjugates have become the hottest area of oncology.” Two, the company is actively developing PYX-201 for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory solid tumors. So far, the treatment has been well-tolerated with no significant evidence of toxicities,\xa0according to the company.', 'Three, the company recently posted an EPS loss of $1.85 a share, which beat by 10 cents. Plus, it has about $120.8 million in cash on hand at the moment. And four, analysts over at H.C. Wainwright just raised their price target to $7 on PYXS, with a buy rating.', 'As noted by TheFly.com, “The analyst increased the peak penetration rates for PYX-201 to 18% from 15% for all indications based on the “differentiated” safety profile and adjusted operational expenses in 2024 and beyond.”', 'Source: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.com', 'We can also look at the\xa0SPDR S&P Biotech ETF\xa0(NYSEARCA:XBI), which recently dipped to $92.69.', 'What’s nice about the XBI exchange-traded fund is that we can diversify with 135 different holdings at less than $95 a share. In fact, with an expense ratio of just 0.35%, the XBI ETF holds numerous hot biotech stocks. Among them are\xa0Moderna(NASDAQ:MRNA),\xa0Exelixis\xa0(NASDAQ:EXEL),\xa0Exact Sciences\xa0(NASDAQ:EXAS), Amgen, and\xa0Alnylam Pharmaceuticals\xa0(NASDAQ:ALNY).', 'While the ETF already ran from about $65 to its current price of $92.69, there’s still plenty of near-term upside remaining. With new biotech innovation,\xa0demand for better treatment, pharmaceutical companies strengthening pipelines and a resurgence of M&A,\xa0biotech could get explosive. And if that’s the case, you want to be well-diversified for max exposure.', 'If we were to buy 100 shares of just one of its holdings — let’s say ALNY — it would cost us about $15,200. Again, just for that one stock. Meanwhile, we can own 100 shares of XBI for about $9,300 and gain exposure to 145 big biotech names.', 'On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

So you have the expectation that OPEC+ is going to carry on with their production cuts. There's also been rising tensions in the Middle East. That has also been sending prices higher."", ""And then you've got the Russian refineries that have been attacked recently. So all of this has had the steady climb effect on the price of oil.

Now, the team at JP Morgan does believe that there are several levers that can be pulled here. And one of them being a summer release of the SPR. And the other one being, of course, demand destruction that starts kicking in when these oil prices start to push up against $90 a barrel."", 'But we have seen Goldman Sachs also saying that they see a range this year anywhere between 70 and 90 for Brent and Morgan Stanley that hiked its price for target for oil at $90 for Brent by the time that the third quarter rolls along.

Their natural next question is, what does it mean for gas prices, Ines?"", ""INES FERRE: Yeah, well, what's interesting is that JP Morgan note said that gas prices could reach $4 per gallon by May if we continue on like this. We are right now at about $0.04 higher than we were for the average last year. It's about $3.53 per gallon."", ""But we're not at the peak driving season yet.

I guess with the exception of Treasury yields going a bit higher."", ""Bob, I'm going to take you first on this. And whether you think that this sell off is justified. Should people be stepping in here to buy the dip?"", ""BOB ELLIOTT: Well, I think there's been a healthy rally that has occurred over the course of the last five months or so end of last year and early this year. And what's happened is we've really repriced expectations significantly. Just think about consensus growth expectations in the US for 2024 went from well below 1 to now 2.2 for 2024. That's a big shift. It's reflected in equity markets."", ""And as a result, you're going to have to have even stronger outcomes than what we've seen lately in order to get stocks to press higher.

And I think that really when you have that higher open on a Sunday night in the lower open intraday.', ""From a technical basis, I think that can start to gain a little bit of steam to the downside. But as Bob just mentioned, I mean, we've had a heck of a little run. I mean, I'm looking at the 21-day moving average."", ""And we tested it, we kissed it today.

I'm not even calling this a sell off."", ""And really we've been anticipating a breather. And what a way we're referring to this is leveling out. I mean, if you're in a flight that takes off, I mean, ultimately, you just kind of level out a little bit. So I think leveling out would just be more of a healthy pullback, consolidate, chop around a little bit."", ""And this is that time of year know. I know April is typically strong. But we were looking from a cycle rally basis that we could see a top that sort of rotates around a little bit from April and May. That's how we were looking at things."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So, wherever we are right now? It seems like you guys agree strategically on one sector. And that sector is energy. Bill, I know you have a particular expertise there. So maybe let's start with you here."", ""Obviously, we've seen crude oil prices climbing up here. Do you think that run is going to continue, and do you chase oil itself, or do you play it in a different way?"", ""BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think oil overall, if you look at the futures, crude oil has really broken out above some of the previous supply zones where resistance was. And what I'd like to see is it build a support level around $83. Now, that's pretty close."", ""But I mean, we could have some significant elevation here in the coming days and weeks if we stay out above $83. Obviously, geopolitics have played a role in underpinning some of the strength. And we've had some new news overnight with the strikes on Iran, in the embassy, in Syria."", ""But China's data over the weekend. We've seen some real strength coming out of the manufacturing sector there. And then on top of that, I think there's something interesting going on within the currency space as China defends the Yuan."", ""So there's a lot of macro tailwinds that are coming abroad that could help continue to lift commodities in general. But one of the ways we're playing is managing the risk and have been positioning and call spreads that we continue to roll up and roll out in our commodity trading advisor. And that's how we're able to capture this with some limited risk as we rally.""]"

RTX recently clinched a modification contract involving its Tomahawk missiles.

The latest modification adds scope for RTX to offer recertification and modernization of 166 Tomahawk Block IV All-Up-Round Missiles. This modification should help enable the missiles to be operational for up to an additional 15 years of service.', 'This modification also provides for missile obsolescence and health monitoring, software maintenance, depot support and associated hardware procurements.

The Naval Strike Missile is a long-range, precision strike weapon that can find and destroy ships at distances of up to 100 nautical miles. A major improvement to Tomahawk is network-centric warfare capabilities, using data from multiple sensors such as aircraft, UAVs, satellites, foot soldiers, tanks and ships to find its target. It will also be able to send data from its sensors to these platforms."", 'The solid demand that Tomahawk missile enjoys in the missile market can be gauged from the fact that the U.S. and allied militaries have flight-tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk 550 times and used it in combat more than 2,300 times.', 'Amid the widespread increase in geopolitical tensions worldwide, nations have been strengthening their defense arsenal manifold in recent times.

Notably, the S&P 500 index has risen over 27% over the past year, while Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) has fallen 3%.', 'This is an opportunity to pick up solid dividend-paying utilities like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), relatively small Black Hills (NYSE: BKH), and absolutely tiny Dividend King Northwest Natural (NYSE: NWN). The best part: They all have historically high yields today.', ""NextEra Energy's 3.2% dividend yield probably won't excite very many dividend investors. But what will excite dividend growth investors, as well as investors looking for a mix of growth and income, is the 10% annualized dividend growth rate over the past decade."", ""Meanwhile, management expects to keep up that impressive pace of dividend growth until at least 2026. Dividend growth of 10% a year is extremely high for a utility, with NextEra Energy's unique model that mixes a regulated utility with a globally dominant clean energy producer underpinning the long-term success here."", 'That said, what dividend investors really need to know is that the 3.2% dividend yield is near the highest levels in a decade. So historically speaking, NextEra Energy looks attractively priced today, assuming your investment goal is dividend growth, not maximizing current income.', ""Black Hills has a market cap of $3.6 billion, which is small compared to $130 billion market cap NextEra Energy. But NextEra Energy's 29 years of dividend increases pales in comparison to Black Hills' streak of 53 years, which lands Black Hills firmly within Dividend King status."", ""What also sets Black Hills apart from NextEra Energy is Black Hills' 4.7% dividend yield. That is well above the yield from NextEra Energy and above the about 3.6% yield of the average utility, using Vanguard Utilities ETF as a proxy. And Black Hills' dividend yield happens to be near a 10-year-high, so it looks like the stock is on sale."", 'Black Hills is a mix of an electric utility and a natural gas utility. It serves regions of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Although inflation and rising interest rates have been a headwind, as they increase operating costs, Black Hills has been working to reduce leverage and, from a business standpoint, customer growth has been running nearly three times as fast as population growth in the United States. Although this utility is probably not one that most investors will have heard of, it appears well positioned to grow its business over the long term.', 'If you want to talk about a small but mighty utility, you need to look at Northwest Natural.', ""This electric and water utility based out of Oregon has an itty-bitty market cap of roughly $1.4 billion. Like Black Hills, Northwest Natural is a Dividend King. However, this little fellow's streak of annual dividend increases is a huge 67 years long and counting. Northwest Natural's dividend yield is 5.3% right now, which happens to be near a 10-year high (and well above the other two yields discussed)."", ""Here's the problem: Northwest Natural is predicting that 2024 will be a bad year on the earnings front, with earnings dropping from $2.59 per share in 2023 to between $2.20 and $2.40 in 2024. The big reason for that is that the utility's costs have gone up, but it won't get rate relief until later in 2024."", 'However, the company knows this and is still backing its longer-term growth forecast of 4% to 6% earnings growth off of 2022 results ($2.54 per share). So management thinks this dip is just a blip as it continues to execute on its long-term growth plan. Given the impressive dividend record, it seems reasonable to give Northwest Natural the benefit of the doubt.', 'There are a lot of utility options if you are examining this out-of-favor sector for investment ideas. Three stand out right now as values, based on their historically high yields.', ""Dividend growth investors will like NextEra Energy. Dividend King Black Hills has a proven record and operates in an attractive region. And for those willing to wait for good news, Dividend King Northwest Natural is working with regulators to take the utility's rising costs into account later in 2024 -- which management clearly believes will get its business back on the growth track. It is likely that at least one of these utilities will be a good fit for your portfolio in April."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

But if you are looking to invest in dividend stocks, higher stock prices can be a big problem. In fact, thanks to the bull market rally, the yield on the S&P 500 index is now just a tiny 1.3%. Dividend growth investors can do better than that with NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), and yield seekers can trounce that with ultra-high-yield Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Here's what you need to know to get started."", ""On the surface, NextEra Energy is a boring utility. And to some extent, that's true, given that its largest business is Florida Power & Light. In fact, with a $130 billion market cap, NextEra Energy is among the biggest utility stocks you can buy. However, that division makes up about 70% of the business. But don't think that NextEra Energy's regulated utility segment is totally boring, because it isn't."", ""Florida Power & Light operates in the Sunshine State, which has benefited from in-migration for years. Sure, NextEra Energy has to get its rates and capital spending plans approved by regulators, so slow-and-steady growth is the norm. But the rising population has resulted in a consistently expanding customer base and increases the need for capital spending, so NextEra Energy's utility business is one of the more desirable out there. That's the foundation behind the 10% annualized dividend growth NextEra Energy has achieved over the past decade. But the company's other main segment is expected to propel dividends higher at a 10% rate through at least 2026."", ""The dividend growth story is backed by NextEra Energy's clean energy business, which ranks among the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world. The company hopes to as much as double its clean energy-generating capacity by 2026. That should keep NextEra Energy's earnings on the rise and support continued robust dividend boosts. Meanwhile, the stock's 3.2% yield is near the highest levels of the past decade and more than twice what you would get from the S&P 500 index. So this dividend growth machine looks like it is on sale right now."", ""Enbridge also has a mix of businesses in its portfolio of vital energy infrastructure. The biggest segment is made up of the company's midstream oil and natural gas assets, which account for around 85% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The pipeline operation is largely fee-based, so it produces reliable cash flows through the energy cycle. Roughly 12% of EBITDA is derived from a natural gas utility operation in Canada, which is regulated and also provides steady cash flows. And the final few percentage points of EBITDA come from renewable power assets, which are driven by long-term contracts. Slow and steady is the name of the game for Enbridge."", ""But that's not such a bad thing when you consider that the dividend has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years, and that the yield is currently 7.4%. That's more than 5 times higher than what you would get from an S&P 500 index fund! The yield will likely make up the lion's share of your total return, but if you are looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates, that probably won't be an issue for you. As for dividend growth, low- to mid-single digits is a reasonable expectation."", ""What's interesting here, however, is that Enbridge is planning to buy three more natural gas utilities in 2024. That will make the company's business even more reliable, shifting the pipeline operation down to 75% of EBITDA, with natural gas utilities growing to around 22%. Basically, even more of the company will benefit from consistent and regulated capital spending-driven growth. Enbridge isn't exciting, but if you like collecting big quarterly dividend checks, this is a great stock to buy in April."", ""There are different ways to invest in dividend stocks. If you are the type of investor that likes dividend growth, NextEra Energy looks like it's historically cheap today. Enbridge, meanwhile, has a lofty yield and a business that is designed to throw off a reliable stream of cash. Both look like great buys in April."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

Fundamentally, the sector could benefit from a rotation in the innovation ecosystem.', 'As a Reuters report mentioned recently, publicly traded technology enterprises witnessed a huge outflow of $4.4 billion. In fact, it was the largest-ever outflow of funds over a single week. It’s not hard to understand why. As artificial intelligence and other technologies boosted share prices, it makes sense to secure profits ahead of a possible correction.', 'At the same time, it’s possible that certain underappreciated sectors could see inflows. With that, the below undervalued healthcare stocks present attractive upside prospects.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Falling under the medical distribution segment of undervalued healthcare stocks, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) engages in the distribution of dental and animal health products in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Per its public profile, the company operates through three segments: Dental, Animal Health and Corporate.', 'While it’s a relevant enterprise, its financial performances last year have been all over the map. For example, in the first quarter, Patterson posted earnings per share of 84 cents, handily beating the estimate targeting 70 cents. However, it missed the EPS targets for the back half of 2023, yielding a negative earnings surprise of 7.75%.', 'For fiscal 2024, expectations are somewhat muted, with experts calling for EPS of $2.32 on sales of $6.56 billion. Last year, the metrics were $2.42 on sales of $6.47 billion. However, the robust performance of the U.S. pet products and services industry could help lift PDCO.', 'Currently, shares are only trade at a forward earnings multiple of 10.84X, below the sector median 15.8X.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'Falling under the drug manufacturing segment of undervalued healthcare stocks, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) discovers, develops, licenses, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. Per its corporate profile, BMY offers products for hematology, oncology, cardiovascular, immunology, fibrotic, and neuroscience diseases. One of its main drugs is Opdivo for various anti-cancer indications.', 'Overall, BMY has been a reliable source of operational performance for stakeholders. Last year, the one glaring miss came in Q2. Back then, the company forwarded EPS of $1.75. However, Wall Street was anticipating earnings of $1.98 per share. Still, inclusive of the Q2 miss, the overall positive earnings surprise last year came out to just over 4%.', 'Moving forward, for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate that EPS will land at $6.28 on revenue of $42.31 billion. Last year, BMY posted EPS of $6.91 on revenue of $41.42 billion.', 'Now, that might seem modest. However, shares are trading hands at only 7.37X forward earnings. In contrast, drug manufacturers post a median forward multiple of 14.45X. Thus, BMY might be one of the undervalued healthcare stocks worth picking up.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Falling under the healthcare plans subsegment, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) represents one of the most recognizable brands in the broader industry. According to its public profile, CVS operates through the Health Care Benefits, Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments. As a multi-tiered enterprise, it offers a wide canvas that could appeal to bargain hunters.', 'No, CVS stock hasn’t exactly lit up the board. However, it deserves a second look for its consistent performances. Notably, the company beat EPS targets four times out of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise came out to just over 5%. Also, it’s worth mentioning that for Q2 2024, analysts have revised their expectations upward three times in the last 30 days.', 'For the current fiscal year, experts believe that EPS will land at $8.31 on revenue of $370.82 billion. Last year, CVS posted per-share profits of $8.74 on revenue of $357.78 billion.', 'Currently, shares trade hands at 9.48X forward earnings, below 85.71% of its peers. That seems overdone. Therefore, CVS ranks among the undervalued healthcare stocks to consider.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Operating under the medical care facilities segment, AMN Healthcare Services (NYSE:AMN) represents one of the riskier undervalued healthcare stocks. Still, if the market gods smile on AMN, it could swing dramatically higher. Per its corporate profile, the company provides healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services to healthcare facilities in the U.S.', 'At first glance, AMN doesn’t seem a bad idea. For example, in the most recent quarter, the company posted EPS of $1.32, beating the consensus view of $1.25. Overall, the average positive earnings surprise in fiscal 2023 clocked in at 10.6%. Strong performances in Q2 and Q3 helped pad the metric.', 'However, analysts anticipate a rough outing in fiscal 2024, projecting EPS of $3.96 on sales of $3.19 billion. In contrast, AMN posted per-share profits of $8.21 on revenue of $3.79 billion. Still, it might come down to a matter of appropriate pricing.', 'Currently, shares trade at 13.41X forward earnings, lower than 86.21% of sector rivals. Encouragingly, covering experts rate AMN a moderate buy with a $78.25 price target, implying a robust upside.', 'Source: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com', 'Falling under the biotechnology sphere, Royalty Pharma (NASDAQ:RPRX) operates as a buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a funder of innovations in the biopharmaceutical industry. From its public profile, Royalty is also involved in the identification, evaluation and acquisition of royalties on various biopharmaceutical therapies.', 'Generally speaking, RPRX stock doesn’t generate much attention. That’s even more the case following a rough outing in 2023. However, contrarians targeting undervalued healthcare stocks might want to give Royalty another look. It’s surprisingly reliable, beating per-share profit estimates four times out of four last year. Indeed, the average positive earnings surprise stood at 11.88%.', 'For fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS will land at $3.77. That’s a bit short of the $4.50 posted in 2023. However, revenue may reach $2.63 billion. If so, it would be an 11.5% jump from last year’s print of $2.35 billion.', 'Enticingly, RPRX trades at 7.74X trailing-year revenue, below the sector median 9.63X. Also, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $44 average price target. Again, it’s well worth consideration for undervalued healthcare stocks.', 'Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com', 'Another entity falling under the biotech category, Voyager Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VYGR) focuses on the treatment of gene therapy and neurology diseases. The company’s lead clinical candidate is VY-TAU01, an anti-tau antibody program for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Its pipeline also includes superoxide dismutase 1 silencing gene therapy, which is being investigated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).', 'One of the exciting factors of VYGR is that it’s hit or miss. That’s not going to appeal to conservative investors but it should attract speculators. For example, in Q3 of last year, Voyager slightly widened its expected per-share loss of 58 cents by coming in at 59 cents to the red. However, in Q4, the company posted EPS of $1.25, dramatically beating the expected loss of 29 cents per share.', 'Now, analysts anticipate a rough year in fiscal 2024, projecting an 84% loss on the top line. However, they also forecast a recovery effort in fiscal 2025. Currently, shares trade at 1.72X tangible book value, below the sector median 2.88X.', 'That seems grossly undervalued considering that experts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with a $16.33 price target. Therefore, it’s one of the undervalued healthcare stocks to gamble on.', 'Source: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com', 'Operating in the medical devices subsector, Semler Scientific (NASDAQ:SMLR) arguably represents the riskiest idea on this list of undervalued healthcare stocks. Per its corporate profile, Semler provides technology solutions to enhance the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers. One of its main products is QuantaFlo, an in-office blood flow test that enables healthcare providers to use blood flow measurements as part of their examinations of a patient’s vascular condition.', 'At first glance, SMLR stock appears incredibly relevant. However, the market feels differently, getting severely “de-risked” earlier in March. One of the issues may have been underperformance in Q4 last year. Back then, Semler posted an EPS of 59 cents against an expected target of 57 cents. However, the positive earnings surprise of Q2 and Q3 came out to a robust 36.55%. By comparison, Q4 was disappointing.', 'Still, experts are hoping for a recovery year in fiscal 2024. They believe EPS will land at $3.40 on sales of $75.5 million. Last year, per-share profits reached $2.68 on revenue of $68.18 million. Shares trade at 10.59X trailing-year revenue without non-recurring items. That’s lower than 90.36% of competitors.', 'Lake Street believes SMLR could hit $65.

Should people be stepping in here to buy the dip?"", ""BOB ELLIOTT: Well, I think there's been a healthy rally that has occurred over the course of the last five months or so end of last year and early this year. And what's happened is we've really repriced expectations significantly. Just think about consensus growth expectations in the US for 2024 went from well below 1 to now 2.2 for 2024.

Bill, I know you have a particular expertise there. So maybe let's start with you here."", ""Obviously, we've seen crude oil prices climbing up here. Do you think that run is going to continue, and do you chase oil itself, or do you play it in a different way?"", ""BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think oil overall, if you look at the futures, crude oil has really broken out above some of the previous supply zones where resistance was. And what I'd like to see is it build a support level around $83. Now, that's pretty close."", ""But I mean, we could have some significant elevation here in the coming days and weeks if we stay out above $83. Obviously, geopolitics have played a role in underpinning some of the strength. And we've had some new news overnight with the strikes on Iran, in the embassy, in Syria."", ""But China's data over the weekend. We've seen some real strength coming out of the manufacturing sector there. And then on top of that, I think there's something interesting going on within the currency space as China defends the Yuan."", ""So there's a lot of macro tailwinds that are coming abroad that could help continue to lift commodities in general.

Unfortunately, they're both in a bit of a rut, trading within shouting distance of their 52-week lows."", 'I think these dips are great buying opportunities for long-term investors. But which one is more likely to outperform the market from its current price?', 'The answer lies below.', ""Of course, the first step in determining which stock to buy is to understand why shares are down in the first place. The broader trend is that revenue growth for both companies has slowed dramatically since 2021, when consumer spending was much stronger due to pandemic stimulus checks. Lululemon's revenue growth has been and remains superior to Nike's."", 'Both companies recently reported earnings and beat analyst estimates on revenue and earnings per share. But the devil is in the details, where each company has struggled.', ""Nike admitted in its earnings call that its execution hasn't been crisp. The company fixated on direct-to-consumer sales to the point that it neglected its traditional wholesale channels. Momentum slowed in the quarter; shoe sales were down 5% quarter-over-quarter, and apparel sales were down 13%."", 'Lululemon issued Q1 guidance that disappointed Wall Street, blaming a soft U.S. consumer for a slow start to this year. Despite that commentary, sales per square foot in U.S. stores are still among the highest in the company, so management remains optimistic about long-term trends.', 'Wall Street occasionally flips which stock to assign the higher valuation to. For most of the past year, Lululemon has enjoyed a premium to Nike. Today that gap is down to a small margin. Both companies now trade between 25 (Nike) and 27 times earnings (Lululemon). I think these are close enough to call them negligible. So investors must look at growth to understand the value between them better.', ""Looking at the past, it's not particularly close. Lululemon has grown its earnings far more over the past five years than Nike. Additionally, analysts have been steadfast in their future expectations. Lululemon is expected to grow faster than Nike; analysts call for 15% annualized earnings growth versus 11% for Nike."", ""While Nike is the cheaper stock, Lululemon's superior earnings growth arguably makes it the better value. This is backed up by the PEG ratio, which compares the stock's valuation to the company's earnings growth. The lower the ratio, the better."", ""Nike's PEG ratio is currently 2.2, while Lululemon's is 1.8."", ""Management's admission that Nike isn't executing to its full potential wraps up this comparison (though I'm happy to see the accountability). I'm sure Nike will figure this out over time, but given Lululemon's more attractive growth and valuation, it's just another knock against Nike."", ""Investors are better off buying and holding Lululemon at today's prices."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lululemon Athletica right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica wasn’t one of them.

The majority of states employ a winner-takes-all system for allocating electoral votes, while Maine and Nebraska use a proportional system based on the candidate's victory in each congressional district. These electors, who form the Electoral College, convene after the general election to cast their votes for the presidential candidate. To win the presidency, a candidate must secure at least 270 electoral votes out of the current total of 538."", 'In the 2020 elections, President Biden secured 81.28 million votes, which accounted for 51.3% of all cast votes. This marked a historic milestone as Biden became the first presidential candidate to surpass 80 million votes. His contender, Donald Trump, garnered 74.22 million votes, constituting 46.8% of the votes cast. This surge in voter participation is reflected in the record-breaking turnout, with over 159.63 million Americans casting their votes. This turnout is unprecedented in US history, marking the first instance where voter participation surpassed 140 million. In terms of the percentage of the voting-eligible population, the voter turnout reached 66.7%, the highest seen in 120 years. To find a higher percentage turnout, one must trace back to the year 1900, when it stood at 73.7%. The record for the highest turnout belongs to the election of 1876, at 82.6%.', 'The significant increase in voter turnout in the 2020 elections was greatly facilitated by companies that supported the electoral process by allowing their employees time off to vote. Following the 2016 elections, where 14% of registered voters cited conflicting work or study schedules as a barrier to voting, companies such as Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) took proactive measures. Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI) offered its workers five hours of paid time off to vote, while Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) provided three hours of paid time off for employees unable to leave for voting during their shifts. Similarly, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) offered up to four hours for voting or volunteering. These companies, along with others, are members of the non-partisan Time to Vote coalition, consisting of over 1,850 companies that encouraged their employees to participate in the 2020 elections. Their efforts were notably successful, contributing to the record-breaking voter turnout in US history in the 2020 elections.', 'Research shows that companies that implement employee-friendly practices, such as granting employees the opportunity to vote, experience benefits in terms of employee productivity and firm value. For instance, in a study published in the Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications, and Conflict, it was found that companies prioritizing employee well-being tend to exhibit superior financial performance and reduced risk levels compared to their counterparts. It was discovered that companies listed on the Fortune ""Best 100 Companies to Work For"" exhibit positive abnormal returns upon the announcement of employee-friendly policies. Similarly, findings from a study by Pepperdine University highlight the link between higher employee satisfaction and improved corporate performance, citing enhancements in recruitment, retention, and motivation within the organization. These findings highlight the importance of corporate initiatives aimed at providing employee-friendly policies and work environments.', ""Here's what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", '“PayPal Holdings, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.”', 'Alexandru Nika/Shutterstock.com', 'We compiled a list of the top 13 states with the most electoral votes using the current allocations for the 2024 and 2028 presidential elections, as provided by The US National Archives and Records Administration.

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 36.57%.', 'For the last reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum came out with earnings of $3.98 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share, representing a surprise of 68.64%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $7.79 per share and it actually produced earnings of $8.14 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.49%.', ""For Marathon Petroleum, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank."", 'Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.', 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Marathon Petroleum currently has an Earnings ESP of +33.14%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects.

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Marathon Petroleum (MPC), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance.

It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area."", ""For MPC, shares are up 0.66% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 1.53% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.65% compares favorably with the industry's 8.37% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Marathon Petroleum have risen 30.81%, and are up 50.7% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.24% and 29.37%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of MPC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MPC is averaging 2,771,619 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MPC.', ""Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPC's consensus estimate, increasing from $14.35 to $15.82 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A.

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is MPC Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.8% over the past month to $15.82.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.

These standards are expected to lessen 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and provide $13 billion in annualized net benefits by 2032. The new regulations are also set to benefit public health, climate, and truck owners and operators.

But this phenomenon is not a new one. Data shows that since the end of 2008, US stocks with dividend yields over 5% returned about 450%, compared to a 1200% return posted by non-dividend companies. However, many analysts believe this is about to change since the era of easy money where interest rates were almost zero is nearing its end. A Wall Street Journal report recently highlighted some trends in dividend investing shared by Daniel Peris in his book “The Ownership Dividend - The Coming Paradigm Shift in the U.S. Stock Market.” Peris argues that the pendulum might shift in favor of dividend stocks since the forces behind the almost 40-year period of low interest rates and buybacks seem to have exhausted and the market could return to the typical structure in which dividends had a lot of importance.', 'There was a time when investing in a company automatically meant you’d get dividends from it since markets were not fixated around short-term share price movements. As Benjamin Graham once said:', '""The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends regularly and, presumably, to increase the rate as time goes on.""', 'From the 1870s to the 1950s, dividends accounted for about 80% of the total market returns, according to the WSJ report which cited economist Robert\xa0J.\xa0Shiller, Sterling Professor of\xa0Economics at Yale. This contribution to returns by dividends declined to 30% over the past decade. But could the tide really turn in the favor of dividends? Early signs are here. Meta Platforms surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a $0.50 a share dividend. Analysts believe as investor appetite for steady income and low volatility increases and markets begin to digest the possibility of the higher for longer scenario, dividend-paying stocks would see a renewed interest.', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first scanned through the list of dividend aristocrats — a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. From this list we chose 11 companies with at least 50 years of consistent dividend increases and positive hedge fund sentiment. We preferred stocks with relatively low payout ratios (under 50%), wider moats and positive analyst ratings. The idea was to prefer dividend growth companies that are offering safe dividends and are deemed investment worthy by smart money managers. But why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).', 'Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 40', 'Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) is one of the biggest steel companies in America, with about 50 years of consistent dividend increases.

Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) has increased its dividend for 52 years without a break.

This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 64', 'PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) is a dividend king with 52 consecutive years of dividend increases.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with ROST.', ""On April 2, 2024, Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) filed its 10-K report, revealing a financial landscape marked by both opportunities and challenges. The company, renowned for its off-price apparel and accessories retailing, has demonstrated a robust financial performance with sales climbing to $20.38 billion, up from $18.70 billion the previous year. This growth is mirrored in net earnings, which rose to $1.87 billion, a significant increase from $1.51 billion. These figures highlight Ross Stores Inc's ability to attract cost-conscious consumers and effectively manage its inventory and costs. With a strong balance sheet and a strategic approach to merchandising and purchasing, the company is well-positioned to navigate the dynamic retail landscape."", 'The main body of the article starts here...', ""Strong Financial Performance and Market Positioning: Ross Stores Inc's financial health is a testament to its competitive advantage. The company's sales have shown a consistent upward trajectory, with the latest fiscal year boasting a remarkable $20.38 billion in sales. This financial vigor is underpinned by a solid earnings per share (EPS) growth, with basic EPS rising from $4.40 to $5.59. Such performance not only reflects Ross Stores Inc's ability to attract and retain a loyal customer base but also its proficiency in maintaining a cost-effective operational model. The company's market capitalization, standing at an impressive $38.09 billion as of July 2023, further cements its status as a leading player in the off-price retail sector."", ""Effective Merchandising and Purchasing Strategies: Ross Stores Inc's success is largely attributable to its strategic approach to merchandising and purchasing. The company's ability to offer a wide assortment of brand-name merchandise at significant discounts is a key differentiator. By capitalizing on manufacturing overruns, retail liquidation sales, and close-out purchases, Ross Stores Inc provides a 'treasure hunt' shopping experience that resonates with its target demographic. This strategy not only ensures a steady flow of diverse and appealing products but also allows the company to maintain a competitive pricing edge."", ""Dependence on Domestic Market Concentration: Despite its financial strengths, Ross Stores Inc's heavy reliance on the domestic market, particularly in states like California, Texas, and Florida, could pose risks. Nearly half of its stores are located in these three states, which makes the company vulnerable to regional economic downturns, natural disasters, or shifts in consumer preferences. Diversification of store locations could mitigate this risk, but the company's current concentration may limit its ability to quickly adapt to changing market conditions."", ""Operational Risks and Supply Chain Dependencies: Ross Stores Inc's operational model, which thrives on opportunistic buying and a vast network of vendors, is not without its challenges. The company's reliance on a global supply chain exposes it to risks such as political instability, trade restrictions, and currency fluctuations. Moreover, the need for a responsive and flexible supply chain is critical to maintaining its off-price business model. Any disruptions could impact the company's ability to deliver the right products at the right time, potentially affecting sales and customer satisfaction."", ""Expansion into New Markets and Demographics: Ross Stores Inc has the opportunity to grow its footprint by expanding into new geographic markets and demographics. With a strong brand and a proven business model, the company is well-positioned to explore untapped markets, both domestically and internationally. This expansion could not only drive sales growth but also reduce the risks associated with market concentration. Moreover, targeting new demographics, such as millennials and Gen Z consumers, through tailored marketing strategies could further bolster the company's growth prospects."", 'Technological Advancements and E-commerce Growth: The evolving retail landscape presents Ross Stores Inc with the opportunity to leverage technology to enhance the customer experience and streamline operations. Investing in e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, and data analytics could enable the company to better understand consumer behavior, personalize marketing efforts, and optimize inventory management. Embracing these technological advancements could also open up new sales channels and improve operational efficiency, providing a competitive edge in the fast-paced retail sector.', 'Intense Competition and Market Saturation: The off-price retail sector is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Ross Stores Inc faces the threat of increased competition from both traditional retailers and online platforms. As the market becomes more saturated, the company must continue to differentiate itself through its value proposition and shopping experience. Failure to maintain its competitive edge could result in loss of market share and pressure on profit margins.', ""Global Economic and Political Uncertainties: Ross Stores Inc's reliance on a global supply chain makes it susceptible to economic and political uncertainties. Trade tensions, tariffs, and geopolitical conflicts can disrupt supply chains and increase costs. Additionally, global economic downturns can affect consumer spending patterns, particularly for discretionary items. Ross Stores Inc must navigate these complexities while maintaining its value proposition and operational efficiency to mitigate the potential impact on its business."", 'In conclusion, Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) stands as a formidable entity in the off-price retail sector, bolstered by its strong financial performance, strategic purchasing techniques, and a well-established market presence.

In fact, the only thing you have to do is set aside $50 per month, and over time, your investment could surpass $100,000. I'm talking about investing in an index fund. So, forget Nvidia, and let's find out more about this easy and potentially explosive strategy."", 'Which index fund should you buy? One that mimics the S&P 500, and a great example is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY). These funds buy shares of companies that are in the S&P 500 to replicate the composition of the index and therefore the performance.', 'So, for example, today Microsoft is the heaviest share in the S&P 500 and the heaviest in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF too. And if the S&P 500 climbs 5%, so will the index fund.', ""Here's why tying your performance to the S&P 500's performance is a good idea. The S&P 500 over time has averaged a 10% annual gain, meaning if you remain invested in an index fund tracking it, you could see your investment increase accordingly."", ""Of course, there's no guarantee the index will continue delivering the same gains as in the past, but its composition, favoring the industry leaders of the times, generally helps it post a positive long-term performance. So, there's reason to be optimistic."", ""And speaking of the index's composition, this is regularly reviewed in order to ensure it represents the companies powering the economy during a particular period. Just recently Super Micro Computer won a spot in the S&P 500. The company sells servers and workstations needed by businesses in the high-growth field of AI, and business has been booming. Supermicro's shares have followed, surging more than 4,000% in five years."", 'All this means an investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF offers you exposure to the most successful companies of the moment, as well as diversification across industries. This results in a combination of growth and safety -- the top movers and shakers should drive growth, and the inclusion of stocks from a variety of industries limits loss potential if one particular player or industry suffers.', 'Today, the three biggest sectors in the S&P 500 are information technology, financials, and healthcare, and eight other industries make up the rest of the index.', ""Now, let's consider how you could turn your $50 per month into a fortune. If you invest $50 every month in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF over a period of 35 years, you'll benefit from the magic of compounding, or the idea that gains produce further gains -- and the value of your investment could grow to more than $162,600."", 'This is considering an average 10% annual increase for the S&P 500. You would have contributed $21,000, and your returns would total more than $141,000. You could increase your monthly investment to score an even bigger win or decrease your contribution according to your budget and still benefit from this strategy.', ""As mentioned, it's impossible to predict future market moves with 100% accuracy, even if the index has performed a certain way over time. So, this calculation should just be used as an example -- exact returns will vary."", ""But the S&P 500 has been known to reward long-term investors, and this means it's likely you'll benefit by investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF over the long haul -- and possibly turn just $50 a month into a six-figure jackpot. So right now, investors looking for a steady long-term path to growth might want to forget Nvidia and instead regularly invest in this top S&P 500 index fund."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

According to a survey conducted by management consulting firm McKinsey, nearly one-third of nurses may leave their job within the next year.', 'The reason? Money. Per McKinsey\'s report, nurses cited ""inadequate compensation"" as the top reason for considering leaving their job in patient care.', 'According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, median pay for nurses is about $39 per hour, or $81,000 per year. Considering median household income is about $75,000, nursing might appear more appealing compared to other careers.', 'But nurses typically take on longer shifts compared to traditional office work, and are actively vulnerable to higher-risk environments given the exposure to sick patients.', 'Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution. The company is best known for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services. However, Nvidia is also making inroads in software and is quietly building an end-to-end AI solution.', 'And Nvidia is looking to apply AI to healthcare. The company recently revealed that it is working with a start-up called Hippocratic AI, which is developing virtual agents that are capable of understanding and processing basic tasks related to patient care.', ""For example, the company's generative AI can help with appointment scheduling as well as follow-up activity after a patient is discharged. To help build its health-focused large language model (LLM), Hippocratic AI is leveraging Nvidia's Avatar Cloud and NIM microservices technology."", 'Munjal Shah, co-founder and CEO of Hippocratic AI, stated that the end goal of these AI healthcare agents is to ""help mitigate widespread staffing shortages and increase access to high-quality care.""', 'This is a noble mission, but one that should be understood on a deeper level. Patient care is extremely complex. This is why practicing medicine requires several years of education, and why there are so many different types of doctors and specialists.', ""To think that chatbots will replace human-provided care is almost otherworldly. And yet, here it is -- sort of. In the grand scheme of things, Hippocratic AI's agents are performing fairly basic functions. Time will tell if the technology becomes sophisticated enough to provide commensurate (or superior) value to real-life nurses and doctors."", 'I think AI has a multitude of applications in the healthcare arena, but I would not bet on robots replacing doctors. Instead, I think a more reasonable area where AI can disrupt medicine is in clinical trials.', 'For example, Novo Nordisk, which is the pharmaceutical machine behind Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy, is currently funding an Nvidia-powered supercomputer that it hopes will help in drug development.', 'Bringing accelerated computing capabilities to the clinical trial process can theoretically assist researchers process data more efficiently. Subsequently, pharmaceutical businesses could uncover meaningful insights including expanded indications for their medicines.', 'The bigger theme here is that artificial intelligence is being introduced into many facets of healthcare. My personal outlook is that AI will become an integral pillar augmenting research and development. While more personal use cases surrounding patient care could be on the horizon, I see these as lofty ambitions.', 'In either case, Nvidia is involved in one way or another. I think now is a great time to consider scooping up shares as the company aggressively pursues markets outside of its core chip business.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

They included ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas, members of the Disney family, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs. Disney also received the backing from proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis. Another advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, had recommended Peltz, and pension fund giant California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) backed Peltz and Rasulo.', '(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Writing by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Jamie Freed and Sonali Paul)']"

Some analysts are starting to worry that the market may be reaching overbought levels and is due for a correction. While growth stocks have propelled the market, their rapid growth also means deeper potential declines if prices turn lower. For investors seeking a more stable option, dividend stocks can offer dependable payouts during periods of market volatility.Dividend stocks tend to see slower growth but provide a degree of downside protection compared to their growth counterparts. Investors should look beyond just a stock’s dividend yield, as high payouts don’t always indicate a quality underlying company. Some firms may offer high yields because their share price has fallen. Yet others may borrow to fund large dividend payments to attract investors.The most dependable dividend stocks typically have a long track record of sustaining payouts through different market cycles. Companies within consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and government services often generate steady cash flows to support consistent dividend distributions. These dividend stocks can offer stability for investors seeking to balance their portfolios as markets reach new highs.\u200b', 'Let’s examine three such stocks that have a history of delivering dependable payouts:', 'Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com', 'Beverage and food company PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) enjoys a solid reputation and track record of dividend payouts.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Not only did it manage to navigate the high inflation period of the last couple of years, but also it grew sales by 9.5% in 2023.

This has helped it to pay 52 consecutive years of dividend growth.With a dividend yield of 2.9%, PepsiCo offers a higher dividend than the sector average of 2.2%, suggesting it could be an undervalued dividend stock. Analysts think the company has further upside potential, with an average target price of $187.03 per share.\u200b They point out that shares may be undervalued today in light of the company’s progress overseas. PepsiCo’s international business is now almost $40 billion, gaining enough scale for better profit margins.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'Dividend stocks like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) provide stability amid volatility. The coffee giant has navigated fluctuating consumer demand by meeting people’s daily needs—whether a morning cup of joe or a favorite specialty drink. Even as inflation impacted many businesses last year, Starbucks still grew global comparable sales by 5% thanks to the enduring popularity of its signature brews.The company distributed over half of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. With a sizable 57% payout ratio, Starbucks ensures a wide margin of safety to maintain its dividend over time. At a yield of 2.5%, SBUX offers investors an attractive income stream above the 2.2% average found in the consumer goods sector.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""United Rentals currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.83%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner."", 'Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.', 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of 21% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Oracle’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' View our latest analysis for Oracle ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 5.6% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Oracle today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $131.71, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Oracle has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 45% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Oracle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ORCL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ORCL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The stock more than doubled in 52 weeks, including a 27% surge in the last month alone.', ""It's fun to see a longtime favorite stock post record share prices and return to valuation ratios not seen since the height of the dot-com bubble, but will Micron shares stay at these lofty heights? Is Micron's stock surge built on solid ground or shifting sand?"", ""I'm not so sure, actually."", 'Micron is a leading maker of memory chips. The product range covers many popular memory types, from the short-lived but fast DRAM used in every computing system to the more permanent NAND chips (formerly known as flash chips) that make up solid-state storage solutions with higher performance than classic hard drives.', 'Both DRAM and NAND chips are in high demand right now. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems require a ton of high-speed DRAM capacity, and they also need a lot of speed-sensitive long-term storage. At the same time, smartphones are starting to sell again after a couple of years with low consumer interest -- and recent flagship models with special AI features can use double the DRAM of a comparable handset without AI functions.', 'Micron is enjoying strong end-market demand and solid revenue streams. And management expects the good times to keep rolling for a while.', '""We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a prepared statement.', ""So shipping volumes are on the rise. At the same time, the semiconductor industry still faces supply-side shortages. That may sound like bad news, but a tight supply and demand balance leads to higher unit prices on the limited number of supply-side memory chips. As a result, Micron's revenue is soaring even when unit volumes are down. For example, the shipping volume of NAND products fell slightly from the first quarter to the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. But NAND revenue rose by 27% anyhow."", ""All in all, Micron's DRAM sales jumped 54% higher year over year while NAND revenue increased by 81% over the same period."", ""At the same time, Micron isn't setting business records right now. It operates in a brutally cyclical industry, and the downswing that started with the inflation crisis may not be over yet."", 'Revenue added up to $18.3 billion over the last four quarters, a long way behind the $33.4 billion record seen two years ago. Free cash flow also soared in 2022, but fell back to negative territory early last year. The company is consuming cash at the moment, not stuffing cash profits into its deep pockets.', ""In other words, Micron's stock price is soaring on somewhat flimsy wings right now. Bullish investors expect years of AI-driven business success, shrugging off the potential headwinds of an unpredictable global economy and the seemingly never-ending lack of chipmaking capacity."", 'For me, Micron has been a fantastic moneymaker in the long run. The shares I bought in the summer of 2011 have gained 1,200% so far while the dividend-adjusted S&P 500 index ""only"" rose by 400%.', 'I\'m not looking to add more Micron shares right now, because the stock may be overdue for a correction. The recent price surge looks overly enthusiastic. It makes more sense to sell a few shares (but not close out the entire position) and move some of my Micron gains into lower-priced ideas.

As of 1:16 p.m. ET, semiconductor specialist Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) had slumped 3.7%, AI software maker C3.ai (NYSE: AI) was down 2.8%, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) had dropped 1.8%, and chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was also off by 1.8%', ""A check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- showed nothing in the way of company-specific news to explain those falling share prices, which suggests investors are focused on broader economic developments."", 'Market watchers have been eager for the Fed to begin dialing down its benchmark interest rate -- an event that will be a major indicator that U.S. inflation is finally under control. Yet Fed Chair Jerome Powell threw cold water on investors\' hopes Friday, suggesting that while the central bank does still plans to cut the federal funds rate this year, it isn\'t in any hurry to start doing so. In a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, Powell said the Fed is looking for ""more good inflation readings"" and doesn\'t want to jump the gun and change monetary policy before inflation is under control.', 'On Tuesday morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its highly watched ISM manufacturing index, which rose to 50.3, up from 47.8 and higher than the level of 48.1 expected by economists. Any number over 50 is indicative of growth in the manufacturing sector, which illustrates that inflation has yet to be fully tamed and adds to the mounting pile of indicators that the Fed may not cut rates as quickly as market watchers had hoped. It also suggests that the chances of a rate cut in June may be fading.', 'That view was reinforced by the resilient jobs data released on Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job openings were virtually unchanged at 8.8 million, while the number of hires and separations were also little changed at 5.8 million and 5.6 million, respectively.', ""The robust economic growth signaled by strong manufacturing and jobs data suggests that while inflation is waning, it's not yet under control."", 'So, what does this have to do with our quartet of AI stocks? In short, when borrowing money costs more, businesses are less likely to adopt game-changing -- and costly -- technologies like generative AI. When money is tight, managers are content to postpone that type of spending until borrowing costs are lower.', 'AMD provides graphics processing units (GPUs) that facilitate the training and use of AI models. These systems can cost tens of thousands of dollars or more per chip, making borrowing costs a consideration for many would-be buyers of them.', 'C3.ai provides ready-built software models for enterprises, which companies may be unwilling to adopt when money is tight.', 'Arm Holdings creates the blueprints upon which many widely used semiconductors are based, receiving licensing fees and royalties for the use of its designs. Higher inflation and slower adoption of tech could result in lower revenue.', 'Micron Technology makes flash memory and storage processors that are critical components of AI processing, so it, too, is affected by higher interest rates.', ""In terms of their valuations, this group of stocks is a mixed bag, though none are particularly cheap based on the most widely used metrics. Arm Holdings, AMD, C3.ai, and Micron currently trade for 27 times, 9 times, 9 times, and 4 times forward sales, respectively. However, when measured using a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in a company's current growth rate -- Arm Holdings, Micron, and AMD clock in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock. C3.ai is the riskiest of the four, as the company has yet to generate a profit."", ""It's still early innings for AI, so there is plenty of upside ahead. That said, investing in AI-related companies isn't for the faint of heart.

McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) shares have sat out of the market rally in the past year, barely rising since March 2023 compared to the 31% spike in the S&P 500. That performance is a bit surprising given that the fast-food titan was setting records around sales and earnings heading into early 2024."", ""There are some clouds on the horizon, to be sure. McDonald's noticed weaker spending and sluggish customer traffic in the core U.S. market over the last few weeks, and competition is heating up for those more cost-conscious shoppers. Rivals like Chipotle are targeting McDonald's industry lead in the drive-thru channel, and there are more pricing pressures now that inflation has slowed down."", ""Don't let these worries keep you away from the stock. McDonald's has all the ingredients necessary to generate solid returns from today's discounted share price. Let's look at some of the key reasons to love the stock right now."", 'If I had to pick a single metric to judge a stock against, then cash generation would rank near the top of the list. As the saying goes, ""Cash flow is destiny."" This metric is even more important for a dividend stock like McDonald\'s, because its payout is ultimately funded by cash production.', ""McDonald's -- and its dividend -- has a bright future ahead. The chain generates more cash than rivals thanks to assets like its huge global sales footprint and massive brand power. McDonald's produced $7 billion of free cash last year, up significantly from 2022 and translating into roughly 85% of earnings. The company's highly franchised selling model means it has a light annual spending commitment as compared to a business like Chipotle, which owns most of its stores outright."", ""It's no surprise, then, that McDonald's can pay (and steadily increase) a quarterly dividend. The last raise was 10%, and its cash flow trends imply further big hikes ahead."", ""McDonald's makes a lot of money by selling affordable fast food. In fact, its profit margin is approaching a record 50% of sales right now, far above Chipotle and other peers. A lot of that gap can be explained by its franchise-selling setup. McDonald's generates much of its earnings through high-margin royalty, real estate, and rental fees, and these revenue streams are much more profitable than traditional markups on food sales."", ""The two main ingredients to awesome long-term returns are a high profit margin plus ample opportunities to generate good returns on those earnings. McDonald's has no shortage of growth initiatives, which lately have included a push to boost customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and improving product quality. There's also a big opportunity around online ordering and delivery."", ""The best news is that investors have a chance to supersize their investments in McDonald's right now thanks to the pessimism surrounding the fast-food giant's shares. The company said customer traffic dipped into negative territory at the start of 2024, raising fears that comparable-store sales gains will slow to a crawl this year. That spooked Wall Street, and now the stock is valued at 8 times sales, down from over 9 times sales at a few points in 2023."", ""Traffic is the metric to watch, then, as the most impactful factor influencing the shares in the short term. But patient investors can look past that noise and focus on McDonald's excellent prospects for earnings growth over the next decade or more."", ""Should you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?"", ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

During the past 25 years, REITs have delivered an 11.4% annual return, crushing the S&P 500's 7.6% annualized total return in the same period."", ""One reason for REITs' outperformance is their dividends. IRS rules require REITs to distribute 90% of taxable net income to investors through dividends, so these stocks can be quite appealing to income-focused investors. According to research from Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds, companies that pay a dividend outperform the S&P 500, with less volatility, than those that don't."", 'Overall, REITs have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.

According to projections by McKinsey & Company, demand for data centers is expected to grow by 10% annually through 2030, and Digital Realty is in an excellent position to capitalize on this long-term momentum.', ""Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR) provides storage properties and is the largest self-storage management company in the U.S. It aims to have highly visible storage facilities in areas with large populations. At the end of last year, it had 2,377 locations. More than 87% of Extra Space Storage's revenue is derived from rent; the rest comes from tenant reinsurance and management fees."", 'Self-storage properties have enjoyed high demand from residential consumers who need a place to keep their extra items and businesses that use the space to store excess inventory, documents, or other supplies.', ""Because these properties are relatively inexpensive to build and operate, they can generate excellent returns. During the past decade, Extra Space Storage's FFO increased 374%, or 16.4% compounded annually, while its dividend payout increased by 305%. Its total return of nearly 400% crushed the S&P 500's return during the same period."", ""According to CBRE Group, the U.S.'s largest commercial real estate company, the market for self-storage facilities will remain robust. Additionally, supply chain issues, elevated construction costs, and high interest rates have prevented overdevelopment in the sector, which should bode well for operators like Extra Space Storage."", 'With more than 1.2 billion square feet of logistics space, Prologis (NYSE: PLD) specializes in facilities serving businesses-to-business enterprises and online retail fulfillment centers, with customers including Amazon, Home Depot, FedEx, and UPS.', 'It has benefited from the shift to e-commerce and online shopping. In addition, online retailers are concerned about building more resilient supply chains after the pandemic shutdowns, and demand for warehouse, storage, and distribution space has risen.', ""During the past decade, Prologis's FFO grew 495%, or 19.5% compounded annually, and its dividend payout increased by 93%. Its total return of 366% has crushed the S&P 500 during the same period. A robust market and the ability to raise rents have been a tailwind for Prologis more recently. During the past few years, its occupancy rate has been over 97%. Meanwhile, from 2019 through 2023, rents have risen by 85%."", 'One thing to watch is the new supply of logistics facilities hitting the market. A few years back, strong demand and low interest rates drove developers to build more facilities and add to the market supply. Building peaked in 2022 and many of these developments will start coming on line in 2024, which could result in slower rent growth for the REIT.', ""Prologis's management believes demand will outpace supply and that it can boost rents by 4% to 6% in the coming years, helping to increase core FFO by 9% to 11%. Finally, ongoing e-commerce trends should remain robust for the next several years, with the warehousing and storage services market projected to grow by 7.7% annually through 2030."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Digital Realty Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Digital Realty Trust, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Digital Realty Trust wasn’t one of them.

However, I think that's an overly critical take. Here's why."", 'UPS missed its guidance last year as demonstrated by comparing the third and fourth columns in the table below. Still, note that UPS hit its 2023 targets (given in its Investor Day presentation in 2021) a year earlier in 2022, as noted by comparing the first and second columns.', ""The variability in UPS performance over the last two years illustrates the difficulties of forecasting delivery volumes. It's not just a question of predicting economic growth (which guides delivery volumes); it's the return to spending on services instead of products caused by removing lockdowns."", ""If that wasn't enough, the company's high-profile labor-contract negotiations led to significant declines in delivery volumes in 2023 as customers diverted deliveries to other networks in fear of strike action."", 'UPS', 'Investor Day Targets for 2023 given in 2021', '2022 Actual', 'Initial 2023 Guidance', '2023 Actual', 'Revenue', '$98 billion to $102 billion', '$100.3 billion', '$97 billion to $99.4 billion', '$91 billion', 'Adjusted operating margin', '12.7% to 13.7%', '13.8%', '12.8% to 13.6%', '10.9%', 'Adjusted operating profit', '$12.4 billion to $14 billion', '$13.9 billion', '$12.42 billion to $13.52 billion', '$9.9 billion', 'Data source: UPS presentations.', ""While it's never good news for a company to miss guidance, it's fair to say UPS was hit with tough conditions in 2023."", ""At the end of the question-and-answer session, CFO Brian Newman provided a negative surprise. UPS maintained the full-year guidance given on the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call given in late January for adjusted operating profit to fall 20% to 30% year over year in the first half and to grow 20% to 30% in the second half year over year. Newman's forecast that Q1 would see a 40% drop left investors wondering how UPS will hit its full-year guidance."", 'That figure is significantly below the Wall Street consensus for Q1 and calls upon UPS to hit the consensus for Q2 just to get to the lower end of the first half of guidance.', 'UPS', 'First Quarter', 'Second Quarter', 'Second Half', '2023 actual adjusted operating profit', '$2.6 billion', '$2.9 billion', '$4.4 billion', '2024 guidance on recent Investor Day', 'Down 40%', 'H1 down 20% to 30% year over year', 'H2 up 20% to 30% year over year', '2024 adjusted operating profit guidance (assuming 40% decline in Q1)', '$1.5 billion', '$2.3 billion to $2.9 billion', '$5.3 billion to $5.7 billion', 'Wall Street consensus estimate for adjusted operating profit', '$1.75 billion', '$2.38 billion', '$5.61 billion', 'Data source: UPS presentations', 'In addition, if UPS is struggling to meet estimates, this could imply that the company is failing to win back customers lost due to the labor dispute in 2023. Winning back those customers is vital to the management\'s expectation that its volume growth will turn positive in the second half. According to Newman in January, the return to volume growth will be ""primarily driven by lapping the volume diversion we experienced in the U.S. last year during our labor negotiations.""', 'As previously noted, the Q1 guidance is a cause for concern. Still, it\'s also important to note that these calculations are relative to Wall Street estimates, and management will have a much better look at the cadence of winning back lost customers than analysts have. Management is not responsible for Wall Street estimates, and the earnings ""miss"" in 2023 is understandable under the circumstances discussed above.', ""Moreover, no one is buying a stock for one-quarter's earnings, and the decline in the share price after the presentation suggests some pessimism is now baked into the stock. On balance, it makes sense to see what management guides toward in its Q1 earnings presentation, probably in late April, before concluding that UPS will miss its initial full-year 2024 guidance.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future."", ""Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, American Express is expected to post earnings of $3.01 per share, indicating a change of +25.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $12.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.74 indicates a change of +14.9% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, American Express is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'In the case of American Express, the consensus sales estimate of $15.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.3%. The $66.21 billion and $71.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.4% and +8.5%, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'American Express reported revenues of $15.8 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.5%.

The EPS surprise was -1.13%.', 'Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Although the companies have seen a sales recovery in 2023, the ongoing headwinds hurt margins. The lower demand for COVID-19-related products is having a negative impact on revenues. The budgetary constraints in U.S. hospitals and a soft Chinese market are impeding revenue growth. Revenues are expected to grow from the recovery in demand for surgeries and procedures, new products and expansion into new markets. An earlier-than-expected demand for respiratory products is also boosting sales. The industry players are raising prices to cope with the higher costs.', 'Industry participants like Stryker SYK, ResMed RMD, Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Insulet PODD and Lantheus LNTH have adapted to changing consumer preferences, and the majority of them are witnessing a rise in share price.

In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. Several companies have shown substantial prowess in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics.', 'Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.', 'Rising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak has led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Diagnostic kit-makers not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are poised to capitalize on the same.', 'Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Mondelez basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Mondelez, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Can they find great picks from the stocks Buffett owns? Absolutely.

Sumitomo is the cheapest of the group with shares trading below nine times earnings. Mitsubishi is the most expensive (relatively speaking) with a P/E multiple of around 16.3.', 'Buffett likes these five stocks for the same reasons. They are conglomerates that operate highly diversified businesses across multiple industries.

Two were oil stocks -- Chevron and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Chevron's share price is well above $100, so it's too expensive to make our list. However, you can buy a share of Occidental for around $66. And, like the five Japanese stocks mentioned earlier, Buffett plans to own it indefinitely."", ""Berkshire currently owns 28% of Occidental worth over $16.2 billion. That's enough to land the oil and gas producer the No. 6 spot among Berkshire's top holdings. Don't be surprised if Buffett continues to buy shares of Oxy hand over fist. Berkshire won regulatory approval in 2022 to acquire up to 50% of Occidental."", 'Buffett thinks highly of Occidental\'s CEO, Vicki Hollub, telling CNBC last year that Hollub is ""extremely competent"" and ""understands oil.""

The dividend yield is around 2.3% today, which isn't huge but is notably higher than what you would get from the S&P 500, which is yielding around 1.3% right now. P&G's products fall into the consumer staples space, but it notably does not make food."", 'The big story with P&G is innovation. It works to ensure that its portfolio of everyday essentials, like paper towels, laundry detergent, and toothpaste, have strong brands backing them. But that strength is derived from offering industry-leading benefits, which allow P&G to charge premium prices. Spending on research and development allows the consumer staples giant to keep upping its game, bringing out ""new"" and ""improved"" products on a regular basis. That, plus the company\'s impressive marketing muscle, brings customers into stores and makes P&G an incredibly valuable supplier for retailers. If you like big, industry-leading companies, this Dividend King should be on your shortlist.', ""Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks. Its namesake brand is iconic around the world and an industry leader in the soda space. But the company's portfolio of drinks spans well beyond what amounts to sweetened and flavored water, including coffee, sports drinks, and, well, plain old water. Coca-Cola has increased its dividend annually for 61 years, and the yield today is roughly 3.2%."", ""While there's innovation that goes on with drinks, the big story for Coca-Cola is the $263 billion market cap company's industry dominance. The Coke brand itself is a huge positive, but then you get to add in a global footprint, a vast distribution network, and the financial wherewithal to support massive advertising campaigns. The company is also large enough to act as a consolidator when hot new drink trends come around, allowing it to adjust its portfolio along with consumer tastes. When you think about soda, you think about Coca-Cola, and that's for good reason. Not only is Coca-Cola a key partner to retailers, but, at this point, it would be virtually impossible to unseat this soda king."", ""Hormel Foods, as its name implies, makes food, with a heavy focus on protein. It has shifted its business over the years from a commodity producer of meat to a branded products company. It has increased its dividend annually for 57 consecutive years and currently yields around 3.2%. What's notable about that figure is that it is near the highest level in the company's history. Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble are decent stocks to own, but they aren't on the deep discount sale rack today; Hormel is."", ""To be fair, Hormel is struggling right now. It hasn't been able to pass rising costs on to customers as quickly as peers; avian flu has hampered its turkey operations, the company bought Planters just as the nut sector was starting to slow down, and China, a key growth market for Hormel, has been recovering more slowly than expected from pandemic lockdowns. Taken together, that's an ugly list. But if you break it down, each individual problem is one that just requires time to fix. Given the company's status as a Dividend King, it seems logical to give management the benefit of the doubt here and collect the historically high yield while you wait for better days. After all, the company has already worked through tough times over the past half century."", 'The big takeaway here is that you can find great dividend stocks right under your nose and probably in your grocery cart. Companies that have paid investors well via reliable dividends for decades on end are literally sitting right in front of you. P&G and Coca-Cola are the kinds of stocks you put on your wishlist, waiting for a market downturn to add them to your portfolio. Hormel, however, is the kind of stock you might want to add to your holdings right now while it is still out of favor.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

But this phenomenon is not a new one. Data shows that since the end of 2008, US stocks with dividend yields over 5% returned about 450%, compared to a 1200% return posted by non-dividend companies. However, many analysts believe this is about to change since the era of easy money where interest rates were almost zero is nearing its end. A Wall Street Journal report recently highlighted some trends in dividend investing shared by Daniel Peris in his book “The Ownership Dividend - The Coming Paradigm Shift in the U.S. Stock Market.” Peris argues that the pendulum might shift in favor of dividend stocks since the forces behind the almost 40-year period of low interest rates and buybacks seem to have exhausted and the market could return to the typical structure in which dividends had a lot of importance.', 'There was a time when investing in a company automatically meant you’d get dividends from it since markets were not fixated around short-term share price movements. As Benjamin Graham once said:', '""The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends regularly and, presumably, to increase the rate as time goes on.""', 'From the 1870s to the 1950s, dividends accounted for about 80% of the total market returns, according to the WSJ report which cited economist Robert\xa0J.\xa0Shiller, Sterling Professor of\xa0Economics at Yale. This contribution to returns by dividends declined to 30% over the past decade. But could the tide really turn in the favor of dividends? Early signs are here. Meta Platforms surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a $0.50 a share dividend. Analysts believe as investor appetite for steady income and low volatility increases and markets begin to digest the possibility of the higher for longer scenario, dividend-paying stocks would see a renewed interest.', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first scanned through the list of dividend aristocrats — a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. From this list we chose 11 companies with at least 50 years of consistent dividend increases and positive hedge fund sentiment. We preferred stocks with relatively low payout ratios (under 50%), wider moats and positive analyst ratings. The idea was to prefer dividend growth companies that are offering safe dividends and are deemed investment worthy by smart money managers.

Braze helps brands manage multichannel marketing across all popular digital channels and approaches it freshly and uniquely.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Whereas legacy AdTech companies went after consumer segments via aggressive campaigns, Braze better navigates consumer engagement practices to manage curated journeys that travel with the user between platforms and “feel” personalized and unique to the user. This type of personalization creates a mental bond between the user and the brand, which, as you can imagine, successfully converts potential customers rapidly. That’s likely why well-known names like Match (NASDAQ:MTCH), NASCAR, and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) leverage the software stock’s unique offerings.', 'Not yet profitable, Braze admittedly trades at a premium today.

These diverse offerings help Intuit smooth out its revenue streams throughout the year rather than seeing an early-year bump that falls off after April when tax season closes.', 'The company’s second-quarter earnings report reinforces the software stock’s strength. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, Intuit improved total B2B revenue by double-digits across all market segments; its consumer segment revenue dipped 5%, but only because of IRS delays in kicking off tax season. Intuit will almost assuredly make up for the lost revenue in the next report, and it’s reasonable to assume significant consumer segment growth if its B2B channels are any indication.

An otherwise untapped market, these advancements position Chegg as a leader in transforming education through AI.

Although the companies have seen a sales recovery in 2023, the ongoing headwinds hurt margins. The lower demand for COVID-19-related products is having a negative impact on revenues. The budgetary constraints in U.S. hospitals and a soft Chinese market are impeding revenue growth.

Diagnostic kit-makers not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are poised to capitalize on the same.', 'Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products.

Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee are some of the states where most of the counties had to undergo natural decrease.

New York's Bronx County also saw its population dropping by 1.8%. In the case of numeric declines, California's Los Angeles County ranked at the top and lost 56,420 people, as a result of negative domestic migration.

It is as easy as walking through your local grocery store, where Dividend Kings, stocks that have 50+ years of annual dividend increases behind them, are all over the place. Three you might want to consider adding to your wishlist, if not your buy list, are Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL). Here's a quick look at each."", ""Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend annually for 67 consecutive years, soundly in Dividend King territory. The dividend yield is around 2.3% today, which isn't huge but is notably higher than what you would get from the S&P 500, which is yielding around 1.3% right now. P&G's products fall into the consumer staples space, but it notably does not make food."", 'The big story with P&G is innovation. It works to ensure that its portfolio of everyday essentials, like paper towels, laundry detergent, and toothpaste, have strong brands backing them. But that strength is derived from offering industry-leading benefits, which allow P&G to charge premium prices. Spending on research and development allows the consumer staples giant to keep upping its game, bringing out ""new"" and ""improved"" products on a regular basis. That, plus the company\'s impressive marketing muscle, brings customers into stores and makes P&G an incredibly valuable supplier for retailers. If you like big, industry-leading companies, this Dividend King should be on your shortlist.', ""Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks. Its namesake brand is iconic around the world and an industry leader in the soda space.

Coca-Cola has increased its dividend annually for 61 years, and the yield today is roughly 3.2%."", ""While there's innovation that goes on with drinks, the big story for Coca-Cola is the $263 billion market cap company's industry dominance. The Coke brand itself is a huge positive, but then you get to add in a global footprint, a vast distribution network, and the financial wherewithal to support massive advertising campaigns. The company is also large enough to act as a consolidator when hot new drink trends come around, allowing it to adjust its portfolio along with consumer tastes. When you think about soda, you think about Coca-Cola, and that's for good reason. Not only is Coca-Cola a key partner to retailers, but, at this point, it would be virtually impossible to unseat this soda king."", ""Hormel Foods, as its name implies, makes food, with a heavy focus on protein. It has shifted its business over the years from a commodity producer of meat to a branded products company. It has increased its dividend annually for 57 consecutive years and currently yields around 3.2%. What's notable about that figure is that it is near the highest level in the company's history. Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble are decent stocks to own, but they aren't on the deep discount sale rack today; Hormel is."", ""To be fair, Hormel is struggling right now. It hasn't been able to pass rising costs on to customers as quickly as peers; avian flu has hampered its turkey operations, the company bought Planters just as the nut sector was starting to slow down, and China, a key growth market for Hormel, has been recovering more slowly than expected from pandemic lockdowns. Taken together, that's an ugly list. But if you break it down, each individual problem is one that just requires time to fix. Given the company's status as a Dividend King, it seems logical to give management the benefit of the doubt here and collect the historically high yield while you wait for better days. After all, the company has already worked through tough times over the past half century."", 'The big takeaway here is that you can find great dividend stocks right under your nose and probably in your grocery cart.

Retailers are buoyed by a newfound sense of hope, driven by the transformative potential of technology, particularly the emergence of generative AI. This optimism is tempered, however, by ongoing economic uncertainties and the lingering aftermath of past disruptions.\xa0', ""Deloitte's Global Retail Outlook 2024 report brings some good news, based on insights from 200 retail leaders around the world. It shows that many retailers are feeling positive about their future earnings and profits. In Europe, especially, retailers are feeling very confident about making more money. However, even with this positive outlook, retailers know that the way people shop online is changing, which presents both opportunities and challenges. Although online shopping is bringing in more money, it is also causing some problems, like expensive delivery costs. Returns management emerges as a significant operational challenge for retailers, particularly in the landscape of online retail. Consumers increasingly leverage free-return policies, exacerbating costs and complicating supply chain logistics. In response, retailers are exploring innovative strategies, leveraging technology to improve product information and mitigate return rates. In the future, retailers will adopt strategic methods to broaden their revenue streams, utilizing resources like customer data to strengthen their retail media ventures and broaden their B2B service options. They are also considering acquiring and consolidating technology services to enhance operational efficiency and expansion in a highly competitive environment.\xa0"", 'In the evolving landscape of retail in 2024, Forbes identified several major trends that are reshaping the industry, offering both challenges and opportunities. Firstly, sustainability is a major concern for consumers, leading to increased demand for eco-friendly products and transparent business practices. However, businesses must ensure their sustainability efforts are genuine to earn consumer trust. Secondly, AI technology, especially generative text, is transforming customer engagement and operational efficiency for businesses. While AI adoption offers numerous benefits, it is essential for businesses to maintain a balance between automation and human interaction. Thirdly, social commerce is on the rise, blurring the lines between online shopping and entertainment on social media platforms. This trend creates opportunities for businesses to utilize live shopping features and collaborate with content creators to connect with customers authentically. Lastly, personalized engagement is becoming more important as customers seek tailored communication from brands. The use of chatbot marketing and targeted messaging allows businesses to interact with customers on a personal level, enhancing the overall customer experience.\xa0', 'Retail sales in the US surpassed expectations in December 2023, driven by increased purchases of motor vehicles and online goods. This positive performance, reported by the Commerce Department, led economists to revise their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter upwards. The strong retail sales data challenges previous expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in March. Despite concerns about potential recession, experts suggest that the economy is in a favorable position for moderate interest rate adjustments in 2024. In December, retail sales increased by 0.6%, following a 0.3% gain in November. This growth was fueled by a variety of factors, including improved availability of goods following pandemic-related disruptions and early holiday shopping trends. Online sales surged by 1.5%, reflecting the ongoing trend towards digital shopping. However, not all sectors experienced growth, with declines observed in electronics, appliances, and furniture stores. Meanwhile, restaurants and bars saw unchanged sales, potentially indicating cautious consumer spending despite previous surges in November. While concerns about consumer spending persist, especially among low-income households facing rising debt levels, economists remain optimistic about sustained spending in 2024.

In part, Jay, what you're saying is investors should be expecting here, some kind of normal seasonal stock price declines heading into summer."", ""JAY MCCANLESS: Yeah. And thank you for having me on. That's part of what we're expecting. Typically, this time of year, demand begins to slow, especially as we get closer to summer."", ""And typically with the seasonal trade that we talk about in, you tend to see the stock prices-- the gains that they had earlier in the spring trade, in the fall, and early winter tend to typically fade as you go get closer to summer. So that's part of it."", ""Part of it also is we've been making an out of consensus call around mortgage rates. We do think they stay around these levels, which could pressure we think affordability and potentially sales volumes and earnings estimates going into the back half of the year."", ""And so that's interesting. Why don't you think that the mortgage rates are going to be coming down maybe as much as some of your peers do?"", ""So we think it's a couple of things. One, with mortgage rates now sitting at 7% plus, if a bank or non-bank goes out to write a mortgage, they're burying some pretty high refinance risk, especially if mortgage rates were to move down quickly. So we think that's part of the reason they're keeping the rates high and the spreads high relative to the 10-year Treasury."", ""We think the other thing and we talk about this in the note, mortgage credit availability is back to 2013 levels. So even if you've saved up the down payment and pre-COVID, you could have qualified for a home.

We think new Homebuilding at least for this spring season is really the only game in town."", ""But now that we're starting to see more product come out of the ground, some of the cycle time and supply chain headwinds, that the industry faced in '21 and '22, those have largely dissipated now. So there's a lot more supply we think, coming on to market.

Did valuation factor into your call at all?"", ""JAY MCCANLESS: No, this is more about what we've seen the last couple of years, especially in the back half of the year where the homebuilders need to meet their volume targets. And they all become a little more aggressive about selling homes. And that's resulted in gross margins missing the last two fourth quarters of the year."", ""And we think might be on the same trajectory this time around. So this to us is more about seeing a similar playbook in what we saw in '22 and '23 in terms of the industry kind of beating itself up in the back half of the year to meet those sales targets. The valuations we think were a little rich on a couple of the names."", 'But by and large, this was more about what we think is going to happen to earnings and maybe the consensus estimates being a little too high relative to what we were expecting.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Jay, thanks so much.

Then, late last year, the government implemented the\xa0Investment Canada Act\xa0(ICA) and the\xa0Critical Minerals Strategy\xa0to reduce Chinese economic influence and reboot investment in critical miners as a measure of national security.', 'That move left Canadian miner Power Metals Corp (TSXV:PWM,OTC: PWRMF) in control of two key assets: a potentially high-quality lithium mine and what could end up being the only functioning cesium mine in the world that China doesn’t own.', 'Canada wants new critical minerals, and it wants their development fast-tracked.', 'In February, Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson\xa0told Reuters\xa0that Ottawa was focusing on six critical minerals for electric vehicles and wind turbines—lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earths elements, and that it planned to boost energy security by significantly reducing the time it takes to develop them.', 'In fact, Canada is hoping to slash development time by nearly a decade.', 'And an essential element of the new critical minerals security strategy is to combat China, which has been using its soft power to scoop up strategic critical mineral assets in North America.', 'The first step was forcing Chinese companies to divest their ownership in Canadian critical minerals.', 'Power Metals spent the second half of 2023 developing an understanding of the large property and mineral discoveries made at their strategic Case Lake play with airborne geophysical surveys, field-based prospecting and mapping programs.', 'They’ve also made several additional land acquisitions\xa0in 2023 and 2024, with a continued focus in lithium, cesium and tantalum, taking on Winsome Resources as a 19.59% partner.', 'Power Metals has drilled over 15,000 meters to date and its most recent drilling campaign just launched in late February this year, eyeing Canada’s most critically strategic minerals against the backdrop of the most attractive new investment scenario the sector has ever seen in North America.', 'Case Lake: China’s Loss, North America’s Gain', 'Power Metals’ flagship exploration project has been described by the company’s Chairman as a “geologist’s dream” and the equivalent of “prime real estate on Park Avenue”.', 'Almost every mineral discovery in Canada has been undertaken in the remotest of areas. But unlike most mining venues, Case Lake is accessible year-round, with all infrastructure in place—right down to elusive cell phone signals.', 'Case Lake is one of the most inexpensive properties to drill in Canada, according to Power Metals.', 'While the access makes it significantly easier and cheaper, that is only half of the story.', 'The cesium, lithium, and tantalum intersections here are in pegmatite that is exposed on the surface and running so shallow that it is less than 50 meters deep in various areas.', 'And the high-grade cesium it holds in its folds is said to be similar to Australia’s famous Sinclair Mine.', 'That’s why Australian money stepped in when the Canadian government forced the Chinese out.', ""Australia's first commercial cesium mine, Sinclair, extracted its last cesium in 2019. And it’s one of only three in the world. The other two are the Tanco mine in Manitoba, Canada, and the Bikita mine in Zimbabwe.

Its world-class, high-grade lithium discovery of over 4% at shallow, open depth was already making waves and earning Chinese attention prior to 2022.', 'But while it was drilling for this lithium and tantalum, Power Metals made a surprise discovery of rare cesium at Case Lake’s West Joe Dyke.\xa0', 'This is some of the highest-grade cesium found in decades, with grades as high as 24% over good intervals.', '- 24.07% Cesium over 1 meter', '- 20.36% Cesium over 1 meter', '- 22.22% Cesium over 2 meters', '- 7.65% Cesium over 7.09 meters', 'Those were the results that prompted the Chinese to pounce on Power Metals.', 'In\xa0September last year, Power Metals further boosted is findings with the discovery of new pegmatite dikes in close proximity to Dome Nine, confirming the presence of a 10-15-meter wide spodumene bearing pegmatite strike with Lithium content as high as 1.12%, along with a new pegmatitic tonalite identified just southwest of the West Joe Zone.', 'Cesium is central to the United States’ goal of winning the 5G race, it plays a key role in aircraft guidance systems, oil and gas drilling, and global positioning satellites.', 'And despite its importance, all the known cesium deposits around the world have either been depleted, or the mines have been rendered inoperable.', 'All of this could leave Power Metals and its Case Lake project as one of the most unique and exciting natural resource plays in the world today.', 'But what the Chinese were eyeing before they were evicted is now an even better story as the 2024 drilling campaign gets underway.', 'The 2024 Drilling Campaign That Could Boost Canada’s Critical Minerals Power', 'Power Metals launched its new drill campaign on February 29, deploying a diamond drill rig at its 100% owned Case Lake Property.', 'The campaign will drill a total of 4,000 meters to delineate and extend Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum (LCT) mineralization along the geological strike and down-dip of Case Lake’s known mineralization.', '“We are very excited to be back at Case Lake and look forward to a successful launch of our winter 2024 exploration program.

Not only did Winsome scoop up the Chinese stake in this Canadian critical metals miner, but it also grabbed the off-take rights to future production.', 'Global eyes are on this critical project—and not just because of the lithium, tantalum and cesium prospectivity …', 'The China-Australia scramble for these assets have as much to do with the easy accessibility and treasure trove so close to the surface. That means cheap drilling for lithium and one of the world’s rarest and most critical elements—cesium, which is not mined anywhere else in the world right now.', 'With a key Australian lithium player now behind Power Metals, and with Winsome now occupying a seat on the Power Metals board, an additional layer of critical minerals expertise is further shoring up the discovery and exploration prowess at one of North America’s most important new discoveries.

But this phenomenon is not a new one. Data shows that since the end of 2008, US stocks with dividend yields over 5% returned about 450%, compared to a 1200% return posted by non-dividend companies. However, many analysts believe this is about to change since the era of easy money where interest rates were almost zero is nearing its end. A Wall Street Journal report recently highlighted some trends in dividend investing shared by Daniel Peris in his book “The Ownership Dividend - The Coming Paradigm Shift in the U.S. Stock Market.” Peris argues that the pendulum might shift in favor of dividend stocks since the forces behind the almost 40-year period of low interest rates and buybacks seem to have exhausted and the market could return to the typical structure in which dividends had a lot of importance.', 'There was a time when investing in a company automatically meant you’d get dividends from it since markets were not fixated around short-term share price movements. As Benjamin Graham once said:', '""The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends regularly and, presumably, to increase the rate as time goes on.""', 'From the 1870s to the 1950s, dividends accounted for about 80% of the total market returns, according to the WSJ report which cited economist Robert\xa0J.\xa0Shiller, Sterling Professor of\xa0Economics at Yale. This contribution to returns by dividends declined to 30% over the past decade. But could the tide really turn in the favor of dividends? Early signs are here. Meta Platforms surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a $0.50 a share dividend. Analysts believe as investor appetite for steady income and low volatility increases and markets begin to digest the possibility of the higher for longer scenario, dividend-paying stocks would see a renewed interest.', 'Methodology', 'For this article we first scanned through the list of dividend aristocrats — a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. From this list we chose 11 companies with at least 50 years of consistent dividend increases and positive hedge fund sentiment. We preferred stocks with relatively low payout ratios (under 50%), wider moats and positive analyst ratings. The idea was to prefer dividend growth companies that are offering safe dividends and are deemed investment worthy by smart money managers.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Union Pacific, it has a TSR of 61% for the last 5 years.

From bustling capitals to historic centers, many European cities struggle with congestion, causing economic losses, wasted time, and environmental concerns. Drivers have to spend hours on the most congested roads in Europe, which leads to stress and frustration. The European University on Responsible Consumption and Production estimates that traffic congestion costs Europe over €100 billion or 1% of its GDP annually. Moreover, research by INRIX, a transportation data company, has revealed that the worst traffic hotspots in Europe could impose a staggering cost of £183 billion on drivers by 2025 due to time wasted in jams.', 'This highlights the significant economic burden of gridlock. In addition to economic costs, increased congestion can lead to high air pollution and carbonization. Air pollution is estimated to cost 1% of the global GDP and result in 6 to 9 million premature deaths per year by 2060, as per an OECD report. Traffic congestion arises from a complex interplay of factors. Among these are the lack of effective public transport options, especially in developing countries, and infrastructure bottlenecks. It is important to understand the causes in order to address the multi-faceted issue of traffic congestion.', 'As traffic congestion becomes a big issue in cities worldwide, it is no wonder that there is a growing market for traffic management systems globally to fight international traffic congestion. According to a study by Markets and Markets, the industry is expected to grow to $72.5 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 11.4% during the period 2023-2028. Positive forces impacting this market include growing concerns for public safety, especially among governments, and the widespread use of advanced technologies such as sensors and cameras.', 'Local regulatory requirements can negatively impact the growth of this market. Europe is expected to hold the biggest share of this market during the aforementioned forecast period.

It recently signed a contract with German Autobahn GmbH for a cooperative intelligent transport system project. This project would involve setting up mobile barriers at limited-time work sites, which will send warning signals to approaching vehicles. Similarly, IBM (NYSE:IBM) also provides intelligent transport systems with capabilities of traffic prediction and analysis for smarter traffic management. Data is gathered through different devices such as cameras, radars, and under-road loop detectors, along with devices using Bluetooth or wireless technologies.
