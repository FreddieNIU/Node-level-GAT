FNDB is managed by Charles Schwab. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for FNDB are 0.25%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.97%.Story continuesSector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For FNDB, it has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector --about 14.80% of the portfolio --while Information Technology and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.07% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 18.09% of FNDB's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added roughly 0.38% so far this year and is down about -8.01% in the last one year (as of 01/06/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.13 and $59.23.FNDB has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 25.28% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1709 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF (DFAT) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&amp;P 900 Value Index. Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF has $7.39 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF has $12.87 billion. DFAT has an expense ratio of 0.29% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Steel-Producers Industry is currently in the top 4% of over 250 Zacks Industries, indicating this trend could continue.With studies showing that roughly half of a stock’s price movement can be attributed to its industry group, here are two of the highest-ranked stocks in the Steel-Producers industry that investors may want to consider buying.Nucor NUE Nucor stock may be one that got away from investors in recent years as it continued to rise. Currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) the opportunity to get in on the next surge higher could be now.The structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck, and cold-finished bars producer has continued to grow its business through lucrative acquisitions with its largest being C.H.I. Overhead Doors for $3 billion in 2022.Nucor earnings are now projected to jump 21% for its current fiscal 2022 at $28.13 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -54% to $12.76 per share following a pair of very tough-to-compete-with years. Still, earnings estimate revisions have started to trend higher for FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the last year, shares of Nucor are up 26% to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -20% and the Steel-Producers Markets -4%. Plus, over the last three years, NUE’s total return including dividends is +187% to also beat the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry’s +69%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $144 per share and 23% from its highs Nucor stock trades at just 4.8X earnings. Nucor shares trade 88% below their decade high of 41.4X and are still at a 68% discount to the median of 15.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteel Dynamics STLD Another steel producer stock carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is Steel Dynamics. As one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. Steel Dynamics makes and markets steel products, processes and sells recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and fabricates and sells steel joist and decking products.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSteel Dynamics earnings are expected to climb 36% for its fiscal 2022 at $21.97 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to plummet -51% to $10.82 a share after a tough year to follow. However, earnings estimate revisions have largely gone up for both FY22 and FY23 over the last quarter.Steel Dynamics is now up +65% over the last year to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -20% and the Steel-Producers Markets -4%. Even better, looking at the last three years STLD’s total return is a very impressive +226% to beat the benchmark and its Zacks Subindustry’s +69%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite Steel Dynamics stock soaring over the last few years its trades at just 4.6X earnings. This is 80% below its decade high of 24.2X and a 62% discount to the median of 12.2X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line The growth of Nucor and Steel Dynamics has been impressive over the last two years, and their valuations appear to support more upside ahead with earnings estimate revisions mostly trending higher.Both stocks also offer respectable dividends to support what could be another year of outperforming the broader market and being a defensive option for investors to hedge against inflation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AYI is slated to announce first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Jan 9, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings and sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.9% and 0.4%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines increased by 20.8% and 11.8%, respectively.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing 10 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has decreased to $2.82 from $2.87 over the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 1.1% from $2.85 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting an 8.3% increase from $926.1 million a year ago.Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Acuity Brands Inc QuoteFactors to NoteHigher pricing, filling of back orders along with renovation projects are likely to have aided the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter. The focus on product vitality and service levels, solid contribution from its Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls or ABL segment, benefits from recent price increases and the OSRAM DS business acquisition are likely to have driven growth for Acuity Brands during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The company has been banking on its strength in go-to-market channels and product portfolio. Its focus on service and product vitality and inorganic moves also bode well.The company is focused on investing in product development. It has been introducing new lighting and controls products and evolving certain parts of the product and solutions portfolio. These products use fewer inputs and are highly mobile. Some of the products are globally sourced, while others are manufactured in the company’s facilities to mitigate the supply-chain complexity, thereby helping in improving margins.However, higher raw materials and freight costs, along with supply-chain interruptions for electrical components, are likely to have weighed on its quarterly margins. Again, slowing demand, project delays and more competitive pricing are added headwinds.Segment-wise, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABL segment revenues is currently pegged at $951 million, down from $1,055 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Within the ABL segment, the consensus estimate for the Independent Sales Network sales is currently pegged at $676 million (down from $737 million reported in the prior quarter). The consensus mark for the Direct Sales Network sales is currently pegged at $95 million (down from $115 million reported in the prior quarter).Retail sales are pegged at $44.7 million, up from $44 million reported in the previous quarter. Sales in the Corporate Accounts channel are expected to fall to $55 million from $73 million reported in the previous quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AYI this time around.

Increased volumes and higher prices are driving revenues at the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment (revenues rose 12% year over year in the first six months of fiscal 2023).Strength across the first aid cabinet service business is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 17.2% in the first six months of fiscal 2023.Cintas, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is also seeing strong growth across its uniform direct sale (33.9% organic growth in the fiscal second quarter) and fire protection services (18% organic growth in the fiscal second quarter) businesses.Cintas’ improved fiscal 2023 outlook raises optimism in the stock. The company now expects revenues of $8.67-$8.75 billion in fiscal 2023 compared with $8.58-$8.67 billion anticipated earlier. Earnings are estimated to be in the range of $12.50-$12.80 per share compared with $12.30 to $12.65 expected earlier. For fiscal 2023, Cintas expects adjusted operating income between $1.75 billion and $1.79 billion ($1.55 billion reported in fiscal 2022).Focus on operational execution, cost-control measures and pricing actions are helping Cintas maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in the fiscal second quarter, the gross margin increased 100 basis points to 47%. The company’s focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, should drive its performance.Cintas’ efforts to consistently reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further raise its attractiveness. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $348.68 million and paid dividends of $215.01 million.In July 2022, Cintas hiked its quarterly dividend by 21.1% to $1.15 per share. CTAS has consistently raised its dividend for 39 straight years. In addition to the dividend hike, the company’s board also approved a new share buyback program, authorizing the company to buy back up to $1 billion worth of shares. This is in addition to the existing buyback program, under which $0.5 billion worth of shares is yet to be purchased.Owing to the abovementioned tailwinds and impressive shareholder-friendly policies, shares of CTAS have gained 13.8% in the past six months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:MRC Global Inc.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Hologic and Edwards Lifesciences are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.41, while EW has a forward P/E of 30.15. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.61.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 3.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 7.48.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help HOLX earn a Value grade of A, while EW has been given a Value grade of C.HOLX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Penney, Kohl's, Target, Walmart, Wayfair and maybe Container Store — and to some extent maybe Macy's — because somebody like [liquidator] Gordon Brothers will be running a really aggressive liquidation sale,"" retail expert Jan Rogers Kniffen told Yahoo Finance.The potential for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) to go bust in 2023 is looking high.A person exits a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 29, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyBed Bath &amp; Beyond said Thursday that bankruptcy is on the table as it works to shore up its leaky balance sheet after a disastrous holiday shopping season.""The Company continues to consider all strategic alternatives including restructuring or refinancing its debt, seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying the Company's business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures, including obtaining relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,"" Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said in a statement.""These measures may not be successful,"" the company added, noting that there is ""substantial doubt"" about its ability to continue as a ""going concern.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.For its fiscal third quarter ending November 26, 2022, sales dropped over 30%, to $1.259 billion from $1.878 billion in the same quarter last year. The company said those numbers reflected ""lower customer traffic and reduced levels of inventory availability, among other factors.""Bed Bath &amp; Beyond expects to report a net loss of $385.8 million for the quarter.Meanwhile, shares of the retailer crashed by nearly 30% in Thursday's session and then another 22% on Friday, putting the stock at levels not seen since 1992.Bankruptcy pros don't rule out a filing from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond happening this month.Story continues""I think it's inevitable that they file,"" Macco CEO Drew McManigle said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see them file as early as this weekend. There's no reason not to. I suspect they've been working on their debtor in possession financing.""When asked about the bankruptcy question, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond spokesperson Julie Strider told Yahoo Finance: ""Since initiating Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc.’s comprehensive turnaround plan at the start of the third quarter, which included financial actions to improve our balance sheet and cash flows, we have been working with strategic advisors to evaluate all paths to regain market share and enhance liquidity, our stated priorities. Such paths may include restructuring or refinancing our debt, seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying the Company’s business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures.

Some offer health care services and advice and now even conduct clinical trials.CVS (CVS) was the first to enter the clinical trial space in 2021 and announced a partnership in 2022 that would provide a platform to power the service. A few months later, Walgreens (WBA) announced its clinical trial program and a team to lead it. Walmart (WMT) joined the party in October with its own announcement.In addition to help them grow their businesses, the retailers say the moves will help diversify trials.A commonly cited statistic during the pandemic, that 90% of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a pharmacy — even as some locations will shutter this year, could explain why.That vast physical footprint could prove useful as clinical trials struggle to find diverse patient pools. The current system involves academic sites or hospitals teaming up with manufacturers to conduct the studies. This can sometimes mean the burden of travel creating a barrier to entry, or resulting in candidates dropping out.A person takes an escalator past a Walgreens, owned by the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 26, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyIt has also resulted in clear racial and ethnic inequities in studies. Only 5% of the U.S. population ends up participating in trials, of which 75% are Caucasian, according to Walgreens chief clinical trials officer Ramita Tandon.Pharmacies see a role in which they can contribute by identifying potential candidates and help to monitor patients — which would solve the transportation and distance problem from traditional clinical trial sites.Tandon recently sat down with Yahoo Finance to discuss the company's efforts in the new space.""We're using our physical footprint as an opportunity for patients to come in and get clinical trial visits completed. Now some of the services that we're able to provide are the low complex services. So screening, diagnostics and some blood draws,"" Tandon said.This means that the existing clinical trial infrastructure remains intact, but with the additional help of the pharmacy.Story continues""But we at Walgreens want to help enable and support that ecosystem so patients don't drop out. And in fact, they can come into their local Walgreens, get a normal follow-up visit completed, and keep that patient in the trial and start to improve the overall retention rates on a clinical trial,"" Tandon said.The company has built out a team, as well as is relying on access to its patient data to help identify the right candidates. And once a candidate is identified and matched to an appropriate trial, there will be a slew of support services to ensure retention.""We have created a centralized operations team that consists of project managers, clinical study coordinators, people that are well versed in the clinical trial conduct, and to be able to support, whether we support on-site — so if a patient comes in to our local pharmacies, we'll have staff available onsite— but also if a trial warrants more of a virtual or a hybrid model, we have the opportunity to digitize and use telehealth,"" Tandon said.Could the company eventually convert space to dedicate to clinical trials — with multiple rooms inside a pharmacy and building out room for more complex medical devices? Tandon said it's possible.""Certainly, it's something for us to continue to think about. But today, as we partner with a number of healthcare systems across the ecosystem and across the nation, our goal is to become a support mechanism for healthcare systems or other providers so that ultimately, patients feel comfortable to participate and as well as carry forward with the trial obligations,"" she said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

While this area can be hard to reach for most, the TikTok shopper pointed out the Walmart scanner can make bargain hunting a breeze.The store’s app allows shoppers to scan barcodes with their phone and check prices to see if items are on hidden clearance. In a separate video, the same TikToker said shoppers can also use the Target app to scan the prices of hidden clearance items — also stored on the top shelf. However, Best Life pointed out that the information online might not match the store’s prices and shoppers will have to scan each product’s barcode (or take a picture of it) at the store’s price check kiosks.In another video, SuperUnsexy added that clearance items can sometimes be found hidden behind other display boxes on shelves that are eye-level and lower. Also, make sure the item’s name or image matches what’s in your hand. If not, you could have a mismarked deal.The Krazy Coupon Lady gave further insight, noting Walmart’s clearance is also sprinkled throughout each department. She tends to find a lot of clearance items on endcaps or in the Home section or near the garden center. Most markdowns also happen within the first five days of the month.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.42 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 20, 2023.HBAN has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.89%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.41.HBAN is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Capital Southwest (CSWC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Capital Southwest is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 30, 2023. CSWC's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.61 a share 24 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Capital Southwest is $0.57, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 7.49%.HBAN and CSWC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$72.77. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.All up, insiders sold more shares in Microchip Technology than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Microchip Technology Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microchip Technology. Specifically, insiders ditched US$723k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Microchip Technology insiders own 2.0% of the company, worth about US$808m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Microchip Technology Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Microchip Technology shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Microchip Technology makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Microchip Technology has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Meanwhile, institutions make up 26% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad. Check out our latest analysis for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthHibiscus Petroleum Berhad is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Polo Investments Limited, with ownership of 6.9%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.4% and 3.6% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Kenneth Pereira is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Hibiscus Petroleum BerhadWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad. Insiders have a RM259m stake in this RM2.1b business. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can  click here to see if they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 50% of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 12%, of the Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Hibiscus Petroleum BerhadWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad. Insiders have a RM259m stake in this RM2.1b business. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can  click here to see if they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 50% of Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 12%, of the Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Hibiscus Petroleum Berhad (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

With the contract down about 17% so far this year, the gas market had its worst start to a year on record, according to Refinitiv data going back to 1991, the first full year of trade for the gas futures contract. That tops the current worst four-day start to a year of down 14% in 2006, and compares with the best four-day start of up 21% in 1997. Low heating demand during what is usually the coldest part of the year should allow utilities to leave more gas in storage than usual this month. Front-month gas futures for February delivery fell 1.0 cent, or 0.3%, to settle at $3.710 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since Dec. 30. Earlier on Friday, the contract dropped more than 5% to $3.52 per mmBtu, its lowest intraday price since July 2021. For the week, the front month fell about 17%, putting it down about 44% over the past three weeks, its biggest three-week drop in history, according to Refinitiv data. That keeps the contract in technically oversold territory, with a relative strength index (RSI) below 30 for a seventh day in a row for the first time since April 2019. Traders said the market's biggest uncertainty remains when Freeport LNG will restart its liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas. After several delays from October to November and then to December, Freeport now expects the facility to return in the second half of January, pending regulatory approvals. Analysts have long been saying that Freeport would likely return during the first or second quarter of 2023 because the company still has a lot of work to do to satisfy federal regulators, including training staff in new procedures, before restarting the plant. Whenever Freeport returns, U.S. demand for gas will jump. The plant can turn about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas into LNG, which is about 2% of U.S. daily production. Freeport shut on June 8 after a pipe failure caused an explosion due to inadequate operating and testing procedures, and human error and fatigue, according to a report by consultants hired to review the incident and suggest corrective actions. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has risen to 98.2 bcfd so far in January, up from 96.7 bcfd in December but still below the monthly record of 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Even though the weather is expected to remain warmer than normal through late January, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would jump from 110.8 bcfd this week to 121.8 bcfd next week as temperatures ease ahead of what are usually the coldest weeks of the year. In two weeks, however, Refinitiv projected gas demand would ease to 120.5 bcfd as the weather turns more mild.

(NYSE:CRM) Trading At A 23% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-trading-120057058.html,1673092857,STORY,['CRM'],"[Does the January share price for Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.08bUS$7.34bUS$8.88bUS$10.5bUS$11.6bUS$12.4bUS$13.1bUS$13.7bUS$14.2bUS$14.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x25Analyst x27Analyst x18Analyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 7.05%Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.46%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.20% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$5.6kUS$6.3kUS$7.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.8kUS$7.7kUS$7.6kUS$7.3kUS$7.0kUS$6.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$71bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$241bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$241b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$109bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$180b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$141, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.034. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SalesforceStrengthDebt is well covered by cash flow.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Now that massive move that you can see lower on the five-day chart here, coming after its Q4 delivery numbers disappointed the Street. And that wasn't all. News today of price cuts on two of its models in China initially sent shares to the lowest level that we've seen since 2020, just above 105 a share before rebounding, actually closing the trading session up just about 2 and 1/2%. That wasn't, though, enough to offset the losses that we have certainly seen this week with Tesla closing off just about 7%.Story continuesAnd rounding it out with Silvergate, it really has been a huge mover to the downside here over the last two days. We're looking at losses of about 44%. Now the crypto market bank really moving to the downside, following some news that it had from the fallout of the FTX collapse. It forced the bank to sell assets at a massive loss to cover more than $8 billion in withdrawals.And JP Morgan, Bank of America, both downgrading Silvergate this week. Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Canaccord cutting their price targets. We also had Moody's actually downgrading Silvergate's long-term deposit rating to junk status since closing at a record back in November 2021. Taking a look at the two-year chart, you certainly see a massive move to the downside. Over the past 14 months or so, looking at losses of just about 94%.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Merit Medical is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MMSI has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MMSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.94, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 27.39. We also note that MMSI has a PEG ratio of 2.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 22.27.Another notable valuation metric for MMSI is its P/B ratio of 3.68. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ALGN has a P/B of 4.65.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help MMSI earn a Value grade of B, while ALGN has been given a Value grade of D.MMSI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ALGN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MMSI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That would more than double the company’s value, despite skepticism from some parties about its ability to monetize ChatGPT. As the fundraising effort moves forward, OpenAI has also struck a deal with Microsoft that will see ChatGPT incorporated into the Bing search engine to offer more conversational and contextual responses to inquiries, The Information reported, citing two people with direct knowledge of the plans.The timeline for that addition is unclear, however, as the company examines the chatbot’s accuracy and how long it would take to incorporate it into Bing. It could reportedly launch before the end of March, though. (At present, Bing receives about 9% of search engine traffic, while Google dominates with an 83% share.) Microsoft and OpenAI have a long relationship. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., invested $1 billion in the startup in 2019. Tesla CEO Elon Musk backed OpenAI after its 2015 launch and last month called ChatGPT “scary good,” warning, “We are not far from dangerously strong A.I.” He resigned from the startup’s board of directors in 2018, citing possible conflicts of interest because of Tesla’s own A.I. work.ChatGPT, which enables users to get intelligent answers to everything from basic queries to hypothetical situations, requires a tremendous amount of computing power to train its algorithm, making investments and stock sales critical. While the chatbot has received praise for its speed and handling of complicated matters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in December that it has a long way to go and “it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.” Story continueshttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1601731295792414720Google isn’t standing still on the A.I. front, and its management declared a ""code red"" after ChatGPT’s release. The company has its own intelligent chatbot, called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). However, it has been slow to incorporate that into search results, as any mistakes the A.I. makes could damage the company’s search reputation.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What’s Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investors’ favor, its price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.AAR Corp. AIR, Signet Jewelers SIG, Vishay Intertechnology VSH, DCP Midstream, LP DCP and First American Financial FAF are some companies that have a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:AAR Corp provides various products and services to the worldwide aviation and defense industries.

Some offer health care services and advice and now even conduct clinical trials.CVS (CVS) was the first to enter the clinical trial space in 2021 and announced a partnership in 2022 that would provide a platform to power the service. A few months later, Walgreens (WBA) announced its clinical trial program and a team to lead it. Walmart (WMT) joined the party in October with its own announcement.In addition to help them grow their businesses, the retailers say the moves will help diversify trials.A commonly cited statistic during the pandemic, that 90% of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a pharmacy — even as some locations will shutter this year, could explain why.That vast physical footprint could prove useful as clinical trials struggle to find diverse patient pools. The current system involves academic sites or hospitals teaming up with manufacturers to conduct the studies. This can sometimes mean the burden of travel creating a barrier to entry, or resulting in candidates dropping out.A person takes an escalator past a Walgreens, owned by the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 26, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyIt has also resulted in clear racial and ethnic inequities in studies. Only 5% of the U.S. population ends up participating in trials, of which 75% are Caucasian, according to Walgreens chief clinical trials officer Ramita Tandon.Pharmacies see a role in which they can contribute by identifying potential candidates and help to monitor patients — which would solve the transportation and distance problem from traditional clinical trial sites.Tandon recently sat down with Yahoo Finance to discuss the company's efforts in the new space.""We're using our physical footprint as an opportunity for patients to come in and get clinical trial visits completed. Now some of the services that we're able to provide are the low complex services. So screening, diagnostics and some blood draws,"" Tandon said.This means that the existing clinical trial infrastructure remains intact, but with the additional help of the pharmacy.Story continues""But we at Walgreens want to help enable and support that ecosystem so patients don't drop out. And in fact, they can come into their local Walgreens, get a normal follow-up visit completed, and keep that patient in the trial and start to improve the overall retention rates on a clinical trial,"" Tandon said.The company has built out a team, as well as is relying on access to its patient data to help identify the right candidates. And once a candidate is identified and matched to an appropriate trial, there will be a slew of support services to ensure retention.""We have created a centralized operations team that consists of project managers, clinical study coordinators, people that are well versed in the clinical trial conduct, and to be able to support, whether we support on-site — so if a patient comes in to our local pharmacies, we'll have staff available onsite— but also if a trial warrants more of a virtual or a hybrid model, we have the opportunity to digitize and use telehealth,"" Tandon said.Could the company eventually convert space to dedicate to clinical trials — with multiple rooms inside a pharmacy and building out room for more complex medical devices? Tandon said it's possible.""Certainly, it's something for us to continue to think about. But today, as we partner with a number of healthcare systems across the ecosystem and across the nation, our goal is to become a support mechanism for healthcare systems or other providers so that ultimately, patients feel comfortable to participate and as well as carry forward with the trial obligations,"" she said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

John, welcome to the programming here. Your take on the jobs report this morning?JOHN GIBSON: Brian, that's exactly what I expected. That's what we reported on Tuesday in our Paychex-IHS job report. What we see is really job growth remains steady, but we certainly have seen for repetitive months now wage growth continues to slow in small businesses.BRAD SMITH: And so for what we're expecting going forward from here, it's really just a matter of for the companies that have already started to do-- started to do some significant belt tightening, as we've talked about, or cuts, where those people start to find other jobs as well.JOHN GIBSON: Yeah. I think, Brad, one of the things to keep in mind, our report is focused on small businesses under 50. And so a lot of times a lot of the headlines we're hearing are really about larger companies, some of which I actually think overhired for the situation and were kind of hoarding talent.In small businesses, we still have areas-- leisure and hospitality is a good one-- where they're still trying to catch up to the hiring where they were prepandemic. Now, what we're seeing in the other sectors is more full employment. They're getting back to where they are. Small-business owners are being very cautious about adding employees, but they're still looking for employees and looking to even upgrade their employees, as you said, as people come into the job market.JULIE HYMAN: And we also have been talking about the phenomenon of job hoarding, right, that many companies are reluctant to lay people off because they were so burned during the pandemic, not being able to find people, that when there's an upturn, they're worried about that again. Do you think that that is more acute among small firms than larger firms?Story continuesJOHN GIBSON: Well, I certainly think that for small firms, their impact and their ability to recover was much more difficult. So as you know, when the pandemic hit, everyone was kind of cutting staff. Then we started to ramp back up very quickly. Small businesses found it more difficult to compete against larger businesses. I think you saw larger businesses begin to take talent. And as small businesses recovered, they were really trying to hold on, retain. We saw them adding benefits-- 401(k), health care-- trying to attract and retain their employees.I mean, keep in mind, remember the great resignation? That was just not too long ago. That was just early in 2022. And so everyone has been very cautious about holding on to the good talent they have and trying to get back to full staffing, and we got there probably about five months ago in small business in most of the sectors. And what we're seeing now is people are still trying to hold on to the talent they have. The labor market is tight, and they're looking for opportunities to upgrade talent if they can.BRIAN SOZZI: But, John, what's their level of fear for the back half of this year? Because when I hear this week a Salesforce come out and cut 10% of its workforce and warn about a slowdown in orders, I have to imagine small businesses are feeling, in many respects, the same things.JOHN GIBSON: Yeah, look, small businesses certainly are concerned about inflation. They don't have the pricing power of larger companies. They're also concerned about the tight labor market, so as we just talked about.The other thing that we're seeing coming up more frequently for small businesses now is access to funding. As you can imagine, as the Fed is raising rates, they're raising the cost of and the difficulty of getting access to capital for small-business owners. So they certainly now are looking for ways that they can continue to fund their business, deal with any type of dips while continuing to deal with inflation.One of the things we're doing a lot of right now with our clients is helping them gain access to the employee-retention tax credit. It's really not a well-understood opportunity. A recent survey said only 63% of small-business owners didn't know was available. And we've helped over 50,000 of our clients access billions of dollars, and the average refund that we're seeing for our clients is about $190,000. So I think that's something that policymakers and, quite frankly, small-business owners need to make themselves-- make available to them.BRAD SMITH: John, from what you're seeing, what are small businesses doing differently to court and ultimately keep talent in the workforce, people who have either left a job and are discouraged in looking for a new one or have just left the labor force entirely?JOHN GIBSON: Yeah, so one of the things that we've seen early on in the pandemic is more small businesses trying to enhance their benefit offering. So one of our fastest-growing businesses-- we're the largest record keeper for 401(k), focused on small businesses. We've seen a lot of growth in that. They're adding that.I think that's going to be further aided by the recent passage and signature by the president of the SECURE Act 2.0 which is going to be able to really begin to level the benefits gap that exists between large businesses and small businesses. It's going to make it easier for employees of small and midsized businesses to save and access their funds in an emergency way.It also provides a credit for adding a plan if you're a small-business owner. It gives a credit for every dollar you match up to $1,000 in some cases. And also it helps small-business owners help fund student loans through a 401(k) program as well. So those are the type of things they're trying to do to attract and retain their employees.JULIE HYMAN: John, I want to ask you a wage question because obviously we saw in the government report a slowdown in wage growth. You saw that in your report as well. And we were just talking with an economist from S&amp;P Global who said some of it is reflective of that the wage-- or the job additions are on the lower end of the wage spectrum. Is that what you're seeing as well, or are there other sort of downward pressures?JOHN GIBSON: I think that's certainly-- I think that's certainly part of it, but I certainly think what we see is small-business owners, look, have been very resilient, and they've really drove a lot of productivity. I mean, the restaurants have reinvented their model of how they're running their restaurants.And so I think what they're doing is recognizing, look, they don't have the same pricing power of larger companies, so they've got to figure out how to get more out of less. So what we're seeing is they're working more hours. So in small businesses, the number of hours worked is up significantly, the highest we've seen in a while.We're seeing them really try to help their employees be more productive-- so a lot of things that we're doing to drive productivity. So small businesses right now are trying to get the most out of the workers that they can, and they're trying to keep wages low.JULIE HYMAN: John Gibson, Paychex CEO, talking to us on this jobs day. Obviously you have a very close association with this whole topic, and we appreciate your insight this morning.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Equinor ASA (EQNR) and GSK plc (GSK). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Caterpillar shares have been standout performers lately, handily outperforming the broader market over the past year (+10.7% vs. -19.8% for the S&amp;P 500 index). The company’s cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions has offset the impact of the supply chain snarls and cost pressures. The Zacks analyst expect that Caterpillar’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow at 29.2% and revenues are predicted to rise 13.5%.The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Equinor have gained +16.1% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry’s gain of +25.3%.

Also, the company’s board increased the extraordinary cash dividend to 70 cents per share from 50 cents per share for the third quarter of 2022.However, the company’s balance sheet has significant debt exposure as compared to the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the company is not being able to capture the potential profit growth from commodity prices that have reached record highs. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Equinor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of GSK have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (-37.1% vs. -16.4%). The company is facing generic competition for key drug, Advair is hampering sales of GSK’s respiratory products, which we believe may not be compensated by new respiratory drugs. Competitive pressure on HIV drugs has risen.According to the Zacks analyst estimates the GSK’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 3.5% over the next three years. Estimate movements have been stable ahead of Q4 results. However, GSK’s specialty products like Dovato, Nucala, Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix, Juluca are driving sales, making up for a decline in Established Pharmaceuticals due to generic erosion.The continued recovery in Shingrix sales is encouraging. GSK has made significant progress in its pipeline. Several pipeline readouts are expected in the near term.

After all, it’s easy to understand why; these companies have upped their payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years, which displays their reliable nature.While that’s impressive, there’s even a step above the Dividend Aristocrats.Let me introduce you to Dividend Kings, those that have shown an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 50+ years of increased dividend payouts.Interestingly enough, several stocks are gearing up to burst into the elite club, including Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Sherwin-Williams SHW, and Aflac AFL.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.Archer Daniels MidlandArcher Daniels Midland is a leading producer of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).ADM’s annual dividend currently yields 1.9%, below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s hard to ignore ADM’s quarterly performance; the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in four consecutive quarters.In its latest release, Archer Daniels Midland registered a sizable 31% EPS beat and reported revenue nearly 8% above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has a favorable growth profile for its current fiscal year (FY22), with earnings forecasted to climb 44% Y/Y. Still, the growth cools down in FY23, with estimates indicating a 15% Y/Y pullback in earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams manufactures and sells paints, coatings, and other related products. As it stands, the company carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesSHW’s annual dividend currently yields a respectable 1.1%, just a few ticks below its Zacks Construction sector average. Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by a double-digit 20% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth is more than apparent, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $8.71 for FY22 indicating an improvement of nearly 7% Y/Y. And in FY23, the company’s bottom line is forecasted to expand a further 19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflac Aflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. Currently, AFL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aflac rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that currently yields 2.2%, modestly below its Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, valuation multiples aren’t stretched, further reinforced by its Style Score of a “B” for Value.

67,512cbfba-d4bb-3b55-973e-9b0802a31d4a,ADM,2023-01-07,Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-company-adm-140002814.html,1673013602,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, to which ADM belongs, has lost 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +44.1%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.36 indicates a change of -15% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $102.19 billion and $100.01 billion estimates indicate +19.9% and -2.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.68 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $0.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.75%. The EPS surprise was +30.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

70,5b7756ca-dcd0-3025-b3f4-5f584bf571cd,LUV,2023-01-07,Is Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Recent Price Movement Underpinned By Its Weak Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-co-nyse-luv-161402242.html,1673021642,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has had a rough month with its share price down 11%. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study Southwest Airlines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southwest Airlines is:7.6% = US$827m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Southwest Airlines' Earnings Growth And 7.6% ROEWhen you first look at it, Southwest Airlines' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.4%. But then again, Southwest Airlines' five year net income shrunk at a rate of 42%. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Southwest Airlines' performance with the industry and found thatSouthwest Airlines' performance is depressing even when compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 31% in the same period, which is a slower than the company.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is LUV fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Southwest Airlines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Because Southwest Airlines doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Southwest Airlines can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

HCA have soared 43.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 34.1% growth. The Medical sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite index have declined 2.8% and 2.5%, respectively, in the same time frame. With a market capitalization of $70.7 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.3 million. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Growing revenues, acquisitions of hospitals or healthcare entities and a sound financial position continue to drive HCA Healthcare.The leading U.S. healthcare services provider, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a decent record of beating estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missing the same twice, the average beat being 2.34%.Can HCA Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $18.18 per share, a 7.2% increase from the 2022 estimate. The same for revenues is pegged at $62.6 billion, a 3.8% increase from the 2022 estimate.Revenues of HCA Healthcare continue to benefit on the back of growing patient admissions. Due to a reduction in the degree of adversities inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic, people are gaining more confidence to opt for outpatient visits, which, in turn, should boost HCA’s outpatient revenues.Buyouts undertaken over the years have added hospitals to the company’s portfolio, diversified income streams and bolstered the nationwide presence of HCA Healthcare.

HCA is in talks with management of the acquiree and if both companies reach an agreement, the Texas presence of HCA is expected to receive a boost.HCA Healthcare also does not shy away from selling non-core businesses to focus on more profitable units. To cater to the huge demand for virtual care, a trend resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which is in no mood to slow down, HCA has well-devised telehealth programs in place.Story continuesThe cash reserves of HCA Healthcare are sufficient to cover its short-term debt obligations. As of Sep 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents stood at $999 million, which stands way higher than the short-term debt of $218 million. HCA has adequate cash-generating abilities in place through which it can undertake significant growth-related investments and engage in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over HCA Healthcare's (NYSE:HCA) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for HCA Healthcare, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$9.0b ÷ (US$51b - US$9.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, HCA Healthcare has an ROCE of 22%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Healthcare industry average of 10%. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare roceIn the above chart we have measured HCA Healthcare's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is HCA Healthcare's ROCE Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by HCA Healthcare's returns on capital. The company has employed 38% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Bottom Line On HCA Healthcare's ROCEHCA Healthcare has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 195% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesHCA Healthcare does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 45% in three years, versus a market return of about 24%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 30% in a year.The recent uptick of 5.9% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Global Payments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the three years that the share price fell, Global Payments' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 53% each year. In comparison the 18% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in. With a P/E ratio of 402.58, it's fair to say the market sees a brighter future for the business.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 18% in the twelve months, Global Payments shareholders did even worse, losing 29% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Global Payments (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Hologic and Edwards Lifesciences are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.41, while EW has a forward P/E of 30.15. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.61.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 3.97. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 7.48.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help HOLX earn a Value grade of A, while EW has been given a Value grade of C.HOLX is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

88,69165f97-71bc-33ec-bac2-fb411f1481ae,NFLX,2023-01-07,"Netflix Is ‘Pleased With the Growth’ of Its Ad Tier So Far, Head of Advertising Says",Variety,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/69165f97-71bc-33ec-bac2-fb411f1481ae/netflix-is-%E2%80%98pleased-with-the.html,1673036495,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix is “pleased with the growth that we’re seeing” in its ad-supported tier since its launch nine weeks ago, said Jeremi Gorman, president of worldwide advertising.Gorman, speaking Friday at Variety’s Entertainment Summit at CES, declined to break out subscriber numbers (Netflix reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan. 19). However, she said, “You would be able to see if I was a concerned human — I wear it on my face.” (Watch the full interview above between Gorman and Andrew Wallenstein, president and chief media analyst, Variety Intelligence Platform.)Gorman, who joined the streamer last year from Snap, where she was chief business officer, said the expectation is for Netflix’s ad tier to be at least revenue neutral — if not positive. About the risk of cannibalizing Netflix’s subscribers who pay for no ads, Gorman said, “The whole goal of it is customer choice… Historically with Netflix, people stay on the plan they originally subscribed to.”Netflix Basic With Ads launched in the U.S. on Nov. 3 at $6.99 per month (30% less than the the regular Basic plan without ads, at $9.99 per month). The ad-supported package is available in 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S.Early data from research firm Antenna, published last month, indicated that Netflix’s ad-supported tier is seeing a relatively slow uptake. Netflix has disputed the accuracy of Antenna’s data.Netflix Basic With Ads excludes some popular TV series and movies, including “House of Cards,” “New Girl” and “The Good Place,” for which Netflix does not currently have rights to serve advertising. (Netflix says 5%-10% of total titles are unavailable in the ad tier, depending on market.) “The vast majority” of Netflix content is available on the ad tier, Gorman said, and reiterated that the streamer is working to renegotiate deals to bring more shows and movies to the offering and at some point “hopefully have everything available.”Story continuesMeanwhile, subscribers on the ad-supported plan, which serves up about 4-5 minutes of commercials per hour of content, can’t download titles for offline viewing. The service also is limited to a single 720p HD stream at a time (as is the case for Netflix Basic without ads).Gorman described her decision to join Netflix as “an amazing opportunity to reach this engaged audience, with this extraordinary content, in a place where marketers have never been able to reach them before,” Gorman said. “It felt like kind of a no-brainer.”Netflix is sticking with traditional 15- and 30-second ads for now, but longer term the company plans to broaden the ad formats to target viewers differently, Gorman said. For example, Netflix expects to introduce single-show sponsorships; it could introduce the ability for marketers to target ads in “gift-giving moments” regardless of content; and add the ability to target ads based on demographic data like age and gender. “We did launch with MVP,” she said, meaning “minimum viable product.”Netflix’s ad-supported service is serving ads through a partnership with Microsoft and its Xandr platform. Gorman said there’s a “broad swath” of advertisers in the initial mix for the ad-supported tier, including consumer packaged goods, automotive, retail and luxury marketers.Netflix comes to the ad market after years of execs resisting the move. Today, most large streaming services offer an ad-based option, including Disney+, which launched a cheaper plan with advertising in December in the U.S. “I think it’s a rising-tide-rises-all-boats situation, for connected TV in general, for ad-supported streaming services, for customer choice,” Gorman said about the competitive landscape. “Each of the companies is really compelling another company to make extraordinary content.”VIP+ Analysis: Netflix Ad Tier Has Hurdles Now, Payoff LaterBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

In fact, for many watchers, it may feel like the couple gave up royal status only to gain it in a different industry. But are their lives really that much richer since leaving the monarchy?The wealth they left behindWhile the British royal family has their own personal wealth — Forbes estimates the family holds $28 billion in assets that can’t be sold and there’s also the $500 million estate the late Queen Elizabeth left behind — they don’t pay out of pocket to perform their royal duties.Instead, they rely on an annual, taxpayer-funded payment called the Sovereign Grant, which is derived from a percentage of the profits coming from the Crown Estate. The rest of that profit is turned over to the government.Story continuesThe grant funds official royal expenses like property upkeep and utilities, travel and payroll. In the 2021-22 tax year, the Sovereign Grant amounted to over $103 million, according to the Royal Household’s financial statement.So, having left that powerful financial support behind, where exactly will Harry and Meghan feel the loss most acutely?According to the Institute for Government, one of the largest public costs for the royals is security. These arrangements aren’t publicly disclosed, but Forbes estimated in 2021 that such services for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could cost up to $3 million per year.Now on their own, Harry and Meghan can’t rely on the royal coffers to fund their safety and travel — but they’re far from destitute.Meghan and Harry’s financial autonomyBefore striking out on their own, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were largely supported by funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, a valuable estate that provides funds for the oldest son of the British monarch. In 2020, Forbes estimated that the couple’s loss amounted to $3 million a year, in addition to their security costs.Forbes also confirmed that Harry was not a beneficiary of his great-grandmother the Queen Mother’s $100 million fortune.That means that when they made the decision to step back from their roles as senior working royals, Harry and Meghan were left with a meager sum of $10 million (estimated by Forbes), largely made up of the inheritance from Harry’s late mother’s estate.Of that number, $5 million reportedly went toward a down payment for the couple’s $14.7 million home in Montecito, California.Read more: The best investing apps of 2023 for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)Building a new empireThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced publicly in January 2020 that they intended to “carve out a progressive new role within [the] institution,” by maintaining royal responsibilities without their royal funding.According to Vanity Fair, the couple received their last royal sum shortly after, which was intended to support them as they transitioned out of their senior roles.As part of that transition, Harry and Meghan set out to trademark their Sussex Royal brand, which would have allowed them to sell a line of products and activities. Retail expert Andy Barr told the Daily Mail at the time that the business could generate revenues of over $500 million, easily outstripping the fortune previously provided by King Charles.Unfortunately, Buckingham Palace ultimately blocked the trademark. The couple instead formed Archewell — an organization that includes audio and media production companies and a non-profit foundation.From their new position as media moguls, the couple have signed lucrative deals with industry leading companies like Spotify, Netflix and Penguin Random House to tell their story of leaving the royal family. These projects, which are expected to collectively bring in up to $138 million, have produced a 12-episode podcast series, a six-hour docuseries, and now a record breaking book.The revenue from Archewell is added to Harry’s executive-level salary as chief impact officer at BetterUp, a San Francisco-based mental health startup. According to reported salaries from Glassdoor, an executive position at this company could have a base salary of over $125,000 a year.The couple may be far from castles and curtsies, but they’ll have plenty of cash to keep them comfortable in California. Which might be good news for Harry and Meghan alike, as the promotional tour for “Spare” has revealed some unflattering truths about his family.Fortunately, the prince seems unconcerned about how the “raw account” of his life is received by others.“I'm looking ahead and am optimistic for what's to come,” Harry told People magazine. “I have a beautiful and blessed life — one that comes with a platform, and with it responsibility that Meghan and I plan to use wisely,” he explained.What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Here's the golden secret to making your retirement fund as secure as Fort KnoxRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Netflix (NFLX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 19, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.59 a share.NFLX has an Earnings ESP figure of 30.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45.NFLX is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) as well.Take-Two Interactive, which is readying to report earnings on February 6, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.90 a share, and TTWO is 31 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Take-Two Interactive is $0.89, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.48%.Story continuesNFLX and TTWO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The facility would replace coal-fired power plants in Germany with gas-fired power plants ready to use hydrogen.The agreement involves the construction of new gas power plants (“CCGTs”) and contributing to Germany’s coal phase-out program. The companies will manage the CCGTs, which will be initially powered by natural gas. It will then switch to hydrogen as fuel to fully run on the same when the volumes and technology are available.The companies will also develop facilities in Norway to manufacture low-carbon hydrogen from natural gas through carbon capture and storage. More than 95% of the carbon dioxide will be absorbed and stored under the seabed offshore Norway.The partnership would develop Norway into a key hydrogen supplier to Germany and Europe. The agreement represents an excellent opportunity to develop a hydrogen industry in Norway, where hydrogen can also be used as feedstock for domestic industries.Beside this, Equinor and RWE are expected to collaborate on projects aimed at generating green hydrogen. They also plan to invest in flexible hydrogen-ready CCGT in Germany, with a total capacity of 3 gigawatts (“GW”) by 2030. The project will contribute to strengthening Europe’s security of supply and boost the production of low-carbon hydrogen.Equinor has set out its strategy to enhance its transformation into a net-zero carbon emitter. The company aims to invest in clean hydrogen in Europe, with an initial 2 GW of low-carbon blue hydrogen production capacity in Norway by 2030.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen What Is Amgen's Net Debt?As you can see below, Amgen had US$38.7b of debt, at September 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$11.5b, its net debt is less, at about US$27.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Amgen's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.3b due within a year, and liabilities of US$45.7b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$11.5b as well as receivables valued at US$5.33b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$43.2b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amgen has a huge market capitalization of US$146.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Amgen's net debt of 2.0 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 7.7 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. If Amgen can keep growing EBIT at last year's rate of 13% over the last year, then it will find its debt load easier to manage. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amgen can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Amgen generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 95% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that Amgen's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And we also thought its EBIT growth rate was a positive. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Amgen takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Amgen , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

Additionally, workers’ pay also improved.Not only that, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits too declined last week. The Labor Department added that on a seasonally-adjusted basis, initial jobless claims for the week ending Dec 31, dropped to 204,000, its lowest level since September.Unfortunately, healthy employment news raised concerns about more rate hikes this year. After all, an increase in employment may lead to an uptick in consumer outlays, and push prices of essential goods and services higher. But the Fed, at present, is bent on taming a considerably high rate of inflation toward its target range of 2%.Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting had already shown that 19 top central bank officials don’t expect any cut in interest rates to be appropriate this year, and they are willing to wait for further evidence that inflation is declining at a sustainable rate. Lest we forget, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had said earlier that the labor market needs to weaken and prevent wage growth that can fuel inflation.Thus, with the Fed expected to tighten its monetary policies amid a strong labor market, increase borrowing costs and dampen consumer outlays, the economy is certainly facing a recession shortly. The International Monetary Fund, too, had warned that one-third of the global economy may face a recession this year.However, investors shouldn’t freak out! Defensive companies are generally recession-proof. These companies are non-cyclical in nature, or in other words, their performances are not dependent on the happenings in the larger equity market.Story continuesDefensive players belong to the healthcare, consumer staple and utility sectors. This is because consumers still need to purchase essential items, including medical care, food, electricity, natural gas, water and various other energy products, irrespective of the economic situation.Further, dividend-paying defensive companies are even a better choice as it assures a steady stream of income. And why not? Dividend payers have solid business models that help them sail through any market upheaval.Investors, therefore, should place their bets on dividend-paying recession-proof stocks such as Cardinal Health CAH, Conagra Brands CAG, Ingredion INGR, Atmos Energy ATO and NRG Energy NRG. Currently, these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and offer high yields. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers. CAH currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and offers a dividend yield of 2.6%.

The success of value investors like Warren Buffett underscores this. Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, managed to register a 20.1% CAGR for Berkshire Hathaway from 1965 through 2021. This favorably compares with a 10.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period.Several other stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here we discuss five such stocks —Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG, Gold Fields Limited GFI, Gerdau S.A. GGB, NRG Energy NRG and Core &amp; Main, Inc. CNM.More on Value InvestingWhile searching for a suitable investment option, value investors with a varied risk appetite are unlikely to consider the price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio among several other popular metrics like price/earnings (P/E), price/sales (P/S) or price/book value (P/B).This is because they often find this ratio complicated, considering the limitations in calculating a stock's future earnings growth potential. Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount.However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.Story continuesWhile P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 25 stocks that qualified the screening:Conagra Brands: Chicago-based Conagra Brands is one of the leading branded food companies in North America. The company offers premium edible products, with refined focus on innovation.The company maintains a highly dynamic product portfolio and incorporates alterations within it as per the preference pattern of the end users. Some iconic brands of the company are Reddi-Wip, Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Frontera, Slim Jim, Blake's and Marie Callender.Conagra Brands has a long-term expected growth rate of 7%.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 2.28%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 2.13%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.02%.Coming into today, shares of the parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Had lost 3.65% in the past month. In that same time, the Utilities sector lost 0.98%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.61%.NextEra Energy will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect NextEra Energy to post earnings of $0.51 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 24.39%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.74 billion, up 13.82% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for NextEra Energy. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. NextEra Energy is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note NextEra Energy's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.47. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 17.52, which means NextEra Energy is trading at a premium to the group.Investors should also note that NEE has a PEG ratio of 2.74 right now.

116,42f5b02e-61cd-30fc-8588-e0ffc65032a1,BK,2023-01-07,The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-corporation-bk-150003425.html,1673017203,STORY,['BK'],"[The market expects The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.31 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.25% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.69%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of +10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

117,a47963d1-231f-30c8-a703-6cf83b2a2cbe,BK,2023-01-07,Recent uptick might appease The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) institutional owners after losing 22% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-bank-130048224.html,1673010048,STORY,['BK'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 22% losses, last week’s 3.7% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Bank of New York Mellon, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bank of New York Mellon?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Bank of New York Mellon already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bank of New York Mellon, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Bank of New York Mellon. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.8% and 7.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Bank of New York MellonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$37m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Bank of New York Mellon. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 7.7% of the Bank of New York Mellon shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Bank of New York Mellon better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Bank of New York Mellon .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It has amassed assets over $423.85 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.65%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 8.65% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 33.35% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskBKLC seeks to match the performance of the MORNINGSTAR U.S. LARGE CAP INDEX before fees and expenses. The Morningstar US Large Cap Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index designed to measure the performance of U.S. large-capitalization stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -0.98% so far this year and is down about -20.03% in the last one year (as of 01/06/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $65.88 and $88.66.The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 20.15% for the trailing three-year period. With about 218 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesBNY Mellon US Large Cap Core Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index.The S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of high dividend-yield companies included in the S&amp;P Global BMI that have followed a managed-dividends policy of increasing or stable dividends for at least ten consecutive years.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.With one of the cheaper products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.40%.Story continuesIt has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.08%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, H&amp;r Block Inc. (HRB) accounts for about 2.43% of total assets, followed by Ltc Properties Inc. (LTC) and Keyera Corp. (KEY-CA).The top 10 holdings account for about 17.47% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF return is roughly 0.80% and is down about -7.29% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 01/06/2023), respectively. WDIV has traded between $51.92 and $69.09 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.79 and standard deviation of 21.85% for the trailing three-year period, which makes WDIV a low risk choice in this particular space. With about 115 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $18.21 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $23.70 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Tyson Foods'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tyson Foods is:16% = US$3.2b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Tyson Foods' Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, Tyson Foods seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 8.9% seen over the past five years by Tyson Foods.As a next step, we compared Tyson Foods' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 7.7% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Tyson Foods is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Tyson Foods Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Tyson Foods has a three-year median payout ratio of 28%, which implies that it retains the remaining 72% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, Tyson Foods has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 31%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Tyson Foods' future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Tyson Foods' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

In her latest campaign for cause, Warren and several other legislators raised concerns over medical credit card companies’ practices and picked up their pens to protest.See: How Much Is Sen. Elizabeth Warren Worth?California Tech Salaries Revealed: Law Exposes How Much Jobs PayIn a letter targeted to Synchrony Bank and Wells Fargo signed by Warren and fellow Sens. Edward Markey (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the lawmakers claim vulnerable customers signing up for medical credit cards may become potential victims of misleading practices by their lenders.“(T)he current structure of our healthcare system often requires that patients enter into medical debt in order to access services they need,” reads the letter. “Within that context, patients — often under duress because of concerns about their medical care — are being pushed into and then locked into medical credit cards despite the availability of alternative payment options that might be more beneficial and offer lower interest rates.”Medical credit cards are credit cards that can only be used to cover health-related costs at specific partner hospitals or providers, who actively promote these credit options to patients trying to cover their medical expenses. Synchrony offers a medical credit card called CareCredit, as well as Wells Fargo with Health Advantage, according to Bloomberg.“Many medical credit card companies have lured patients with pitches of ‘no interest’ periods ranging from six to 24 months, which are actually deferred interest promotions that are controversial and allegedly inherently deceptive,” wrote the lawmakers. “These promotions tout ‘no interest’ but actually interest is accruing during the promotional period and will be retroactively charged if the entire balance is not paid off by the end of the promotional period.”Story continuesAnother point of contention is that these types of cards adversely affect customers’ credit scores as they cover the cost of a specific medical service, “meaning the card is maxed out immediately, damaging card holders’ credit scores,” per Warren’s site.The group of senators has requested information from the lenders by Jan. 12, 2023. As Bloomberg reported, the Stamford, Connecticut-based Synchrony is “working with the senators and other public officials on gathering information in response to their request,” per a company email statement.“CareCredit works hard to ensure our products are offered responsibly and with clear, simple, transparent terms so consumers can make well-informed decisions about financing their care,” the statement read.Explore: What Are the Medicare Extra Help Income Limits for 2023?Learn: Americans Underestimate Importance of Medical Savings, Costing Them Up to $700KIn Dec. 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered GE Capital Retail Bank (now known as Synchrony Financial) and its subsidiary (CareCredit), to pay $34.1 million to more than one million customers who were lured similarly into “interest free” credit cards that were accruing interest that was retroactively charged when the balance was not paid off by the end of the promotional period.More From GOBankingRates40 Cities That Could Be Poised For a Housing CrisisHow Rich Is Former President Donald Trump?The 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20236 Strategies for Paying Off Multiple Credit CardsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Medical Credit Card Practices Could Cause Patients Financial Harm, Warren Warns]"

With 87% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 5.7% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 0.08% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Mastercard, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Mastercard does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mastercard, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. Our data shows that The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 6.7% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Mastercard Incorporated. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$362m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Mastercard. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

A Mastercard spokesperson told Fortune that the company is in the process of selecting the five artists, and that any interested candidates can apply on its website.The accelerator, which will be enabled by the Polygon blockchain, is set to launch this spring, he added. The five initial artists will receive guidance with Web3 tech, such as creating their own NFTs, which Rajamannar said could give their growing fan bases access to special perks.Through Mastercard’s own limited edition NFT, the Mastercard Music Pass, new fans of the emerging artists can also get exclusive Web3 and music educational materials, and participate in collaborative experiences both online and offline.Sometime before the end of 2023, the five artists will show off what they've learned during a livestreamed artist showcase.The new program builds on Mastercard’s previous engagements with Web3 technologies, including crypto and the metaverse, which Rajammanar said have helped the company reach an expanded audience.Last spring, the company worked with The Recording Academy to bring Grammy Week, a week of events leading up to the Grammy Awards, to the digital world game Roblox.The company also launched the Belle Block industry group last June with the goal of bringing more women and non-binary people into Web3.Rajamannar said the program would be considered a success if the company can help the five emerging artists get more fans and attention for their work.“That's the whole purpose at the end of the day,” he said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said his announcement Thursday of chips that will incorporate satellite technology into phones, teaming up with Iridium Communications Inc., is just the beginning for that advanced kind of connection. New smartphones featuring the technology will be able to connect anywhere and the capability will fit inside standard handset designs, he said. Later, Qualcomm and its customers will bring similar capabilities to many more devices, including personal computers and cars.Asked about demand for his chips, Amon said the automotive market has been more resilient than other customers. That’s being helped by the need for more chips per car rather than an overall increase in the number of cars sold, he said in a interview with Bloomberg Television.Smartphone shipments haven’t yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels, Amon said. While the phone market is now largely driven by upgrades, rather than new consumers buying their first device, 5G systems are still being deployed. The new faster wireless network, and an upcoming enhanced version, will tempt consumers to trade in their old handsets, he said.Story continuesMercedes-Benz Touts Plans to Build Fast EV Chargers (5:30 p.m. New York)Markus Schaefer, Mercedes-Benz Group AG board member and chief technical officer, used the show as a chance to promote the automaker’s plans to build 10,000 electric vehicle fast chargers around the world and help tackle range anxiety, which he said is still “absolutely” a hurdle to widespread adoption.“We need a premium charging experience, and that’s exactly what we’re targeting,” Schaefer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.Schaefer said the burgeoning EV market is still “very fragile,” which explains why the company recently adjusted prices for its most expensive models in China. Tesla also recently boosted incentives and slashed prices to keep up with cooling demand in the largest EV market.Delta Makes Wi-Fi Free as It Prepares for Travel Surge (4:30 p.m. New York)Delta Air Lines Inc. sees a “very, very strong” year for travel in the US during 2023, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in a Bloomberg Television interview at CES.The carrier announced Thursday that it would provide free onboard Wi-Fi for all customers, regardless of which class they fly, starting Feb. 1. The change, offered with connectivity partner Viasat Inc., beats Delta’s peers to a long-desired benefit.Delta has tested SpaceX’s Starlink satellite-based internet service and decided it’s “not ready for prime time,” Bastian said when asked about further tech partnerships. “As technology continues to expand and people continue to develop in this space, there will be new opportunities for us.”While no major US carrier uses Starlink, it’s agreed to provide in-flight internet service for Hawaiian Airlines as early as this year.--With assistance from Sean O'Kane, Ian King and Caroline Hyde.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a CornerUsed-Car Prices Are Finally DroppingAfter the GOP’s Strife, the Big Winner Might Be Joe BidenThe Great American EV Battery Revolution Might Finally Be HerePoland’s Election Provides a Path Out of EU Isolation©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Lockheed Martin, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$52b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Lockheed Martin's ROCE Trending?Lockheed Martin is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 41% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom LineAs discussed above, Lockheed Martin appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 62% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Lockheed Martin does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin  that you might be interested in.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

144,0a26bc3b-b996-38bf-b27e-1a79117ef68f,LMT,2023-01-07,Raytheon (RTX) Wins $209M Deal for Naval Strike Missile,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raytheon-rtx-wins-209m-deal-123512033.html,1673008512,STORY,"['RTX', 'LMT', 'BA', 'NOC']","[Raytheon Technologies Corp.’s RTX Missile &amp; Defense segment recently clinched a contract for procuring the Naval Strike Missile Coastal Defense System. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.Details of the DealValued at $208.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2028. The deal will serve the Republic of Romania.The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Kongsberg, Norway. This contract will also include options, which on being exercised, will bring its cumulative value to $217 million.Benefits of the DealIncreasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to further strengthen their defense systems. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and Raytheon being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.Notably, Raytheon’s Naval Strike Missile (NSM) is a long-range, precision strike weapon that seeks and destroys enemy ships at distances greater than 100 nautical miles. NSM uses an advanced seeker for precise targeting and carries a 500-pound class warhead with a programmable fuze. NSM is also suited for land attack missions because it can climb and descend with the terrain.With such advanced weaponry in its portfolio, Raytheon enjoys solid demand in the defense space. The latest contract is a bright example of that, which, in turn, should boost its top-line growth.Looking AheadPer a report by the Allied Market Research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2022-2031 period. Its earnings are expected to reach $82 billion by 2031. Such massive growth projections indicate solid opportunities for Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Boeing BA, which specialize in developing technologically advanced missiles.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman’s missile defense program includes AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation guided missiles, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system and rocket propulsion systems.Northrop boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.15%. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.Lockheed Martin’s missile defense program includes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs. It also manufactures the Multiple Launch Rocket System, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Javelin tactical missile programs alongside other tactical missiles.Lockheed boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.62%. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.Likewise, Boeing’s Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense portfolio includes Arrow 3, which provides it with regional missile defense capabilities to enable an effective response to short and medium-range ballistic missiles.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 sales suggests an improvement of 6% over 2021’s reported figure. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Raytheon Technologies’ shares have rallied 11.5% compared with the industry’s 2.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

146,08250ffb-a9d8-3a6f-9d1c-c95cce1cb899,BAX,2023-01-07,Baxter - Steak at Hamburger Prices,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-steak-hamburger-prices-160518515.html,1673026802,STORY,['BAX'],"[Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is a health care company that offers a wide range of products and services such as dialysis treatments, IV solutions, infusion systems, parenteral nutrition therapies, inhaled anesthetics, generic injectable drugs and surgical products. As of its most recent annual report on Dec. 31, 2021, the company had manufacturing operations in more than 20 countries and sold its products in over 100 countries.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BAX. Click here to check it out. BAX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAXPeter Lynch Chart of BAXIt completed the spinoff of its pharmaceutical business Baxalta in July 2015 and made acquisitions of Claris, a generic injectable products and services business, in July 2017 and Hillrom, a medtech company, in December 2021. The company has about 60,000 employees.Baxter's stock has been battered this past year, down about 40% from highs, which is much worse than the S&amp;P 500 and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE).Baxter - Steak at Hamburger PricesBAX Data byBaxter - Steak at Hamburger PricesBaxter faces strong competition within the market, but it holds a leading position in various categories, and entering the market would be difficult due to regulatory and reimbursement hurdles.Baxter's three largest units are detailed as follows:Renal Care: This unit includes sales of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis machines, as well as additional dialysis therapies and services.Medication Delivery: This unit includes sales of IV therapies, infusion pumps, administration sets and drug reconstitution devices.Pharmaceuticals: This unit includes sales of premixed and oncology drug platforms, inhaled anesthesia, critical care products and pharmacy compounding services.Baxter forms deep relationships with its customers like clinics, hospital systems and governments and, once imbedded into its customers' systems, it is very difficult for a competitor to displace it.Hillrom acqusitionThe Hillrom acquistion was one of the largest medtech deals of 2021 and closed in December that year. Baxter bought Hillrom for 10.5 billion and also assumed Hillroms cash and outstanding debt, bringing the total value of the deal to $12.4 billion. The Hillrom acqusition has added basic equipment, including hospital beds, to the portfolio, although about half of Hillrom's 2021 revenue came from more digitally connected offerings like its smart beds and Voalte medical communications app.Story continuesBaxter said Hillrom was attractive because it would help it expand its digital capabilities and give it a broader array of medical products and services to offer patients and clinicians around the world. In addition, it said it expects the combination to accelerate the companies expansion into digital and connected care solutions that are increasingly providing patients with access to hospital-level care at home or in other non-hospital care settings.When it acquired Hillrom in December 2021, Baxter assigned values of $6.8 billion to goodwill and $6 billion to other intangibles as part of the deal. Last quarter, alarmed by rising interest rates and declining equity valuations, as well as supply chain problems cutting into Hillroms sales forecasts, Baxter re-evaluated the unit and essentially admitted that those initial figures were too high given current economic conditions and it had overpaid. It took a $3.1 billion charge to write down the goodwill and reduce the carrying amounts of intangible assets related to trade names acquired from Hillrom. However, Baxter's total market cap has come down by over $18 billion dollars since the acquisition.Baxter acquired Hillrom with debt, so it has become highly levered. Total debt is $16.43 billion, with $9.32 billion due in five years. However, the company has made deleveraging a priority and has begun to reduce long term debt. I expect that the company should be able to pay down about $1 billion a year. As of Dec. 31, 2021, Baxter's net debt to capital ratio was 54.6%, and its net debt to trailing 12-month Ebitda ratio was 4.9. This represents an increase from the previous year, attributed to the Hillrom acquisition.In this time, it is likely to temper shareholder returns like dividend and share buybacks while it tackles deleveraging. Debt maturity is quite spread out, and the company has healthy cash flow and is somewhat recession resistant. While the debt is manageable, the company may struggle in the short to intermediate term with return on invested capital while it navigates the current high interest environment. Though Baxter has over payed for Hillrom, the saving grace was that it was able to lock in low interest rates for borrowed funds.Baxter - Steak at Hamburger PricesThe following diagram shows the various components of Baxter's operating cash flow. I think the best metric to assess Baxter's performance is the core FCF (shown as the orange line). Core FCF is free cash flow without changes in working capital and with stock based compensation deducted. Core FCF has increased at the rate of 10% annually (and 14% through December 2021 prior to the current bear market and the Hillrom acquisition).Baxter - Steak at Hamburger PricesValuationThe stock has lost 7% in value since August and about 40% year to date. However, I expect it to see strong price recovery over the next 18 months and the medium term (2025 to 2027) time frame.Baxter's GuruFocus valuation panel is mixed:Baxter - Steak at Hamburger PricesWhile the GF Value and median price-sales value show excellent value, other metrics are poor. Because of continual acquisitions and divestitures over the years, Baxter's earnings and cash flow have fluctuated. The company does appear to be somewhat undervalued if we look at the Shiller price-earnings ratio (10-year average price-earnings ratio) of 15.83 and the forward price-earnings ratio of 13.81. The historical median price-earnings ratio for the company is 23, which would imply an undervaluation of about 15% to 60%.Baxter pays a dividend yield of around 2.3%, which has grown at an impressive 16% clip over the last five years. The company has also bought back modest amount of stock but that will likely stop as it reduces debt.ConclusionOverall, my opinion is that investors currently have a value opportunity in this high quality medical devices and medical services company. Usually Baxter trades at a substantial premium, as shown by its median historical price-earnings ratio of 23 versus the shiller price-earnings ratio of around 15. With aging demographics in most advanced countries, Baxter's products and services should continue to be in high demand. The management team appears to be on the ball and is shareholder friendly. The company appears to be well positioned to be a long term compounder, despite short term issues.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

FATE announced that it has declined a proposal from Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ company, for the continuation of the collaboration and option agreement between the two on revised terms and conditions. Consequently, the agreement has been terminated and all collaboration activities will be wound down in the first quarter of 2023.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the FDA approved an investigational new drug (IND) application for a first collaboration product for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. FATE expects to receive a $3 million milestone payment for the same product. With the termination of the collaboration, Fate Therapeutics will wind down its activities with Janssen, including discontinuing the development of all collaboration products at the expense of Janssen.In May, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen exercised its commercial option on FT555, a multiplexed-engineered, iPSC-derived CAR NK cell product candidate targeting GPRC5D, a tumor-associated orphan G-protein-coupled receptor found to be highly expressed on myeloma cells. In September, Janssen exercised its commercial option for a second multiplexed-engineered, iPSC-derived CAR NK cell product candidate, which targets an undisclosed antigen expressed on certain blood cancers.Shares of the company are down in pre-market trading on the news. Shares of Fate have declined 91.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 16.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcurrently, Fate Therapeutics has also decided to advance its most innovative and differentiated programs, which have a multiplexed-engineered cellular framework of novel synthetic controls designed to promote multi-antigen targeting, increase potency, extend functional persistence, and enable patient dosing with reduced conditioning chemotherapy. The decision follows a strategic review.This pipeline prioritization and expense reduction will provide a 3-year operational runway.Story continuesFate ended the fourth quarter with approximately $475 million in cash, cash equivalents and receivables. Based on its pipeline prioritization and expense reduction efforts, Fate expects to have sufficient financial resources through the end of 2025 to capitalize on its iPSC-derived chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK and CAR T-cell programs.Fate will reduce its headcount to approximately 220 employees in the first quarter of 2023. The company will discontinue clinical development of its FT516 and FT538 NK cell programs in acute myeloid leukemia, its FT516 and FT596 NK cell programs in B-cell lymphoma, and its FT538 and FT536 NK cell programs in solid tumors.Fate intends to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA in mid-2023 to commence a phase I study of its second-generation program in combination with CD20-targeted mAb therapy for the treatment of NHL, including without the administration of intensive conditioning chemotherapy to patients. Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Price and Consensus Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Price and ConsensusFate Therapeutics, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Fate Therapeutics, Inc. Quote The ongoing phase I study of the FT576 BCMA-targeted CAR NK cell program will accrue higher-dose, multi-dose treatment cohorts.Among T-cell programs, the ongoing phase I study is assessing conventional single-dose and novel split-dose treatment schedules of FT819 to compare pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy.Meanwhile, under the company’s collaboration with ONO Pharmaceutical Co., the companies are conducting IND-enabling activities for FT825/ONO-8250, a multiplexed-engineered, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidate targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing solid tumors. The parties expect to submit an IND application to the FDA in 2023 to commence a phase I study of FT825/ONO-8250 for patients with HER2-positive solid tumors.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderFate currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In that same time, the Medical sector gained 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.61%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Medtronic as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Medtronic to post earnings of $1.26 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 8.03%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.5 billion, down 3.37% from the prior-year quarter.MDT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.26 per share and revenue of $30.42 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -5.23% and -3.98%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

I talked with Goodyear Chairman and CEO Rich Kramer about the new technology and whether inflation has peaked for the tire maker.RICH KRAMER: We have two announcements here, one being a tire made out of 90% sustainable materials. And this is something we're really proud of relative to our goal of getting to zero greenhouse gas emissions down the road and helping the industry. You know, Brian, what you know from the last time we talked, we had a tire at 70% sustainable materials. Now we're at 90%. And we're proud of this.What we continue to do is really focus on taking more petrochems out of the tire, replacing them with biomaterials and other materials that will allow us to recycle the tire more. And we're doing that not giving up any performance, and in particular around rolling resistance, which gives you better fuel mileage, whether you're in an ICE vehicle or you're getting range out of an EV vehicle. So more sustainable, no-- no take away of performance. And we're the first company to get to that 90% level.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, so two ingredients-- I'll call them ingredients. I don't know what else to call them, Rich. I'll call two ingredients that stood out to me on this tire. You're using soybean oil and rice husk waste. Why those two elements in the tire? And you mean to tell me that the tire will not wear out faster because you're using those products?RICH KRAMER: Well, you know, Brian, you're exactly correct. So-- so those two materials-- really-- really got to give credit to the team for coming up with this. One, both of those actually don't degrade performance at all. They actually increase it. In fact, as we look at soybean oil, it makes the tire more pliable in cold conditions. It gives it more grip.Story continuesAnd on rice husk ash, we use it as a place of petro-based silica. And what that does for us is actually improves rolling resistance on the tread. So this is a way of actually moving to those bio-based materials that I said and not giving up any performance and, in fact, in many cases enhancing performance.BRIAN SOZZI: Why is a product like this so important to a company like Goodyear and its future?RICH KRAMER: Well, for us, I think number one, it's the right thing to do as we think about the sustainability goals that we and our customers have. Secondly, it's what our customers are asking for. As you well know, we have Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 goals that we have to achieve.And bringing a sustainable tire to our customers helps them achieve those. That's really important to us. And then when we add features like intelligence to it and our service proposition, we can bring a whole different set of solutions to customers as we think about the mobility trends that we see going forward around fleets, autonomous connected, and electric vehicles.BRIAN SOZZI: How difficult is it to scale a product like this up?RICH KRAMER: So, Brian, it's actually a great question. And it is harder to scale because we're talking about a whole new complement of materials coming in, which means having to build a supply chain to be able to do that. And it's why having the right partners to collaborate with to get us those materials is so important. We're on the front end of that. But this is something that's going to continue to evolve.But, Brian, I want to tell you, this is not something that's just an idea that we have. While the 90% material is a demonstration tire, which, by the way, passes all Department of Transportation requirements, the 70% tire, the tire made out of 70% sustainable materials, you can actually go on our website and buy right now. So we're trying to bring this to life even as that supply chain matures to make sure that we're not just putting prototypes out but actually bringing this to market.BRIAN SOZZI: When will I be able to-- when will I be able to see a 100% sustainable tire from a Goodyear? And what would be in that tire that's not in this one?RICH KRAMER: So our goal is by 2030 to have a tire made out of 100% sustainable materials. Again, I'm going to give hats off to my team for their ingenuity, for their tenacity to get us to 90% today. And I'll certainly thank the collaboration we've had with our suppliers.I would tell you that other 10% is going to come from, again, replacing certain of the materials that we have to make sure we can get the performance we want. And it's ultimately going to rely on the collaborations with some of our partners to come up with some of the inventions that we need to replace that last 10%. But I'm confident that we're going to get there. I'm 100% sure we're going to get there.BRIAN SOZZI: I-- we focus a lot on jobs and reskilling the workforce at Yahoo Finance, Rich. And this seems like a real opportunity to upskill a lot of your workers. Would you agree with that?RICH KRAMER: I would agree with that. And I would say not only upskill, but I would say what we've seen is real purpose to those working on projects like this. So instead of just getting a tire, giving us a new size or maybe a different tire one of our customer might ask for, this is really working on a social problem, an environmental problem that we have. So not only upskilling but giving our associates purpose to solve a bigger problem is something that we've seen. The excitement internally is palpable.BRIAN SOZZI: One big problem for manufacturers continues to be is inflation, Rich. Have you seen any peak in your business, any slowing growth rates in anything that goes into a tire at this point?RICH KRAMER: Well, I would tell you, as you well know, the markets, particularly in Europe, are still giving us a lot of headwinds. The markets have been down as we went into the last months of the year. And we've still seen those high costs around some transportation, around labor, and around energy, certainly in Europe.But I would also say we're starting to see some of those raw material costs roll over. So as we get into the first half of 2023, we'll still see some of those headwinds coming. But, Brian, I would tell you as we look to the second half, and as we look to some of those costs rolling over, and we look to the economy perhaps picking up some more steam back then, we're pretty confident about the second half of the year.BRIAN SOZZI: One of my friends, Rich, knew I was coming to talk to you, and they recently had a blowout in a tire. It wasn't a Goodyear, so that's a good thing. But they spent $400 to get one tire.I mean, the pricing has gone up a lot. And the economy continues to slow. Do you see consumers balking a little bit, maybe pushing it to the limit on what tires-- how far they should even have these tires left on the cars given their financial standings and the pricing of some of these products?RICH KRAMER: Well, Brian, I would tell you two things. One of the things is that given the retail outlets that we have and our partners out there, we look very closely at tread wear as we take tires off, as they get replaced. And I would tell you we're not seeing tread wear going down to levels beyond what is normal. And that tells me that consumers are still in the mode of changing tires at a normal cycle. That's a really good thing.And, yes, tire pricing has gone up, but that's also because, as we said earlier, those input costs have gone up so dramatically. And a way that we deal with that-- and I'll go back to one of the reasons that-- one of the benefits that we got from doing the Cooper Tire acquisition-- is we have a whole lineup of tires at different price points for different segments that allow the consumer to meet the needs that they have. And I think that's actually one of the benefits that we got from that deal as well.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you still-- do you think you have the opportunity to push through some more price here?RICH KRAMER: I think as we look at what our input costs are, it's something that we have to do. And it's something that we'll continue to consider. So, yes, I do think it's something that we're paying very close attention to.BRIAN SOZZI: That was Goodyear Chairman CEO Rich Kramer talking about a new tire technology.]"

(MRK): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-merck-co-140002727.html,1673013602,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.39 points to a change of +22.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.30 indicates a change of -1.3% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.71 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.16 billion and $58.22 billion estimates indicate +18% and -1.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not surprisingly, given that the energy sector was the only sector in positive territory this past year, up 59%, nine out of the 10 top stocks in 2022 were oil and gas-related businesses.Very early in the new year, investors are likely wondering who the winners and losers will be in 2023. An excellent place to start would be to go with those stocks that exhibited momentum in December.To qualify for my list of three top stocks that will shine again in 2023, a company must have delivered positive returns in 2022, generated a return on assets of 10% or higher, and have more than $1 billion in free cash flow.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn 2023, there is a good chance that the winning stocks will be companies with healthy and protectable margins rather than those with strong revenue growth.ORLYO’Reilly Automotive$840.72OXYOccidental Petroleum$61.05MRKMerck &amp; Co.$111.14O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)Source: ShutterstockO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) had a total return in 2022 of 19.51%, 200% higher than the S&amp;P 500. It finished 2022 with a five-year total return of 28.54%.Good for a company that sells aftermarket automotive parts to the professional and do-it-yourself (DIY) crowd. Through the nine months that ended Sept. 30, 2022, its revenue from DIY customers was $5.91 billion, or 57% of its overall sales. Sales to professional service providers accounted for 40% of its $10.75 billion overall, with other sales accounting for the remaining 3%.In late October, while reporting its Q3 2022 results, O’Reilly’s full-year 2022 guidance included same-store sales growth of 5.0% at the midpoint of its outlook, revenues of $14.2 billion, earnings per share of $32.60, and $1.95 billion in free cash flow.In July, August, and September, O’Reilly repurchased 1.0 million of its shares at an average price of $683.09. As a result, its return on the $710 million investment is 23.5% through the end of 2022. In the first nine months of 2022, it repurchased 4.4 million shares at an average of $646.61.Story continuesSince January 2011, it’s repurchased 90.2 million shares at an average price of $219.14, good for a compound annual growth rate of 11.9%, 215 basis points higher than the index over the same 12 years.It’s an excellent business in good times and bad. Aftermarket auto parts rarely lose their demand.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) had a total return in 2022 of 119.08%, 713% higher than the S&amp;P 500. However, it finished 2022 with a five-year total return of -0.84%.Less risk-tolerant investors who want to bet on OXY stock in 2023 might consider buying Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, BRK.B) stock instead. Warren Buffett’s holding company has significant investments in energy other than its 194.4 million shares in Occidental.However, if the risk isn’t a problem, Occidental could be in for a repeat performance in 2023. Perhaps not a triple-digit return — it’s the best year in Occidental’s history and the top-performing stock in the index — but a 20-30% total return shouldn’t be out of reach for the oil and gas company.“[W]e believe OXY is positioned to generate record free cash flow and earnings driven by the combination of a meaningfully lower cost structure, low production decline profile, and higher commodity prices benefiting not only the upstream, but midstream and OxyChem segments as well,” stated Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann in a note to clients in November.Through the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, 2022, it had a free cash flow of $11.05 billion, 25% higher than for all of 2021. Based on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $14.0 billion, OXY has a free cash flow yield of 24.4%, well above 8%, the minimum yield I consider to be value territory.Assuming oil prices remain high in 2023, there’s no reason to believe Occidental’s valuation won’t move higher in the year ahead.Merck &amp; Co. (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comMerck &amp; Co. (NYSE:MRK) had a total return in 2022 of 48.42%, 349% higher than the S&amp;P 500. It finished 2022 with a five-year total return of 17.32%. It yields a healthy 2.6%.In August, I included Merck on a list of three top stocks to buy. The other two were Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Hershey (NYSE:HSY). Merck stock is up 22% since. Of the three stocks, it’s easily been the best performer over the past five months.At the time, Merck was looking to acquire Seagen for $37 billion. The biotech is focused on cancer medicines such as Adcetris, which is expected to generate at least $805 million in revenue in 2022. However, the deal never got completed due to regulatory concerns.While it still might happen, Merck went ahead and acquired Imago Biosciences for $1.35 billion. Imago is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing bone marrow disease treatments. It might not be a business of Seagen’s stature, but it deepens the company’s pipeline for hematology drugs.Bloomberg recently discussed why Merck stock had its best calendar-year performance since 1995.“‘In our view, MRK is a compelling long-term growth story as it continues to expand franchise cornerstone Keytruda into additional and earlier-line indications,’ Mizuho analysts wrote in a note,” Bloomberg reported on Dec. 30.I suggested in my August article that Merck “remains an excellent defensive play.” There’s no question it also remains an excellent offensive play in 2023.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

166,c70e7891-747d-3af6-b41e-ff1c1505083c,BA,2023-01-07,Positive week for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) institutional investors who lost 1.2% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-boeing-company-nyse-110131591.html,1673089291,STORY,['BA'],"[A look at the shareholders of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 50% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$13b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 1.2% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Boeing. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Boeing. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Boeing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthBoeing is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of BoeingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Boeing Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$72m worth of shares (at current prices).

This DNA Test Can Tell You",ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-dog-nine-lives-too-143000505.html,1673015400,STORY,['ILMN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 6, 2023 / Originally published on Illumina News CenterIn 2019, Rachel Miro was living alone in a studio apartment in Pittsburgh when she decided to foster a four-legged friend. She went to a local shelter and was immediately taken by a floppy-eared mutt with dark, expressive eyes: Milo. The shelter told that he was almost a year old.Milo was in pretty bad shape at the time; he had parasitic worms that were affecting his health. And after Miro helped nurse him back to health, she decided to adopt him.As a self-proclaimed ""crazy dog lady,"" Miro was enthusiastic to learn more about her pup. ""I've always been fascinated by any product promising to provide more information on my dog or enrich my dog's life,"" she says. She found a DNA test-one that not only traced lineage and breed specificity, but also uncovered genetic mutations associated with health risks-manufactured by a company called Embark Veterinary. The test revealed that Milo had a relative who was a few years older, and it made her want to dig deeper.Then, in 2022, when Boston-based Embark launched a test to accurately determine a dog's age, Miro was first in line for its beta testing. Milo had just been diagnosed with arthritis, and his fur had already begun to gray. ""I was puzzled as to why he'd be showing signs of aging at such a young age,"" Miro said. Embark's new test showed that Milo was already six and a half-far older than she'd been told. Suddenly, his arthritis, graying snout, and mature size made more sense.Embark's vision is to use science to provide accurate answers to folks like Miro, so their dogs can live longer, healthier lives. Age and breed are the two key questions dog owners have when they adopt, says CEO and founder Ryan Boyko, and understanding a dog's genetic makeup can help their owners better feed, train, and care for them.Embark's Dog Age Test rests on the established link between age and DNA methylation. As animals age, enzymes attach small chemical tags called methyl groups to their DNA base pairs, which regulates the expression of specific genes. Certain methylation patterns change predictably with age, meaning they can act as a sort of clock. Measuring the amount of methylation in a dog's DNA gives an accurate estimate of a dog's calendar age.Story continuesThe test was developed in partnership with Illumina, as the level of DNA methylation is assessed using Illumina's Infinium Methylation Array. The canine saliva samples received from the consumer are processed using two kinds of fluorescent beads that attach to methylated and unmethylated DNA bases. The samples are scanned and a comparison of the ratio of one fluorescent signal type to the other is performed to help determine the degree of methylation. Embark analyzes the lab results and sends the consumer a report with preventive care tips.Embark hopes this new test will be just one of many that can produce insights for pet owners. ""We're looking at other technologies that build on our base of genetic and canine knowledge to help us find other ways to improve dogs' lives,"" Boyko says. The age test has already helped a number of dog owners, including Miro. During the company's beta testing phase, 40% of customers took action after learning their dog's true age, and about a third of those who took action sought veterinary care.After learning Milo's true age, Miro began taking preventive measures. To limit the impact of his arthritis, she cut back on his exercise. Before, she took him on runs and hikes, but now she tracks his activity to make sure he's getting an appropriate amount without overdoing it. She also began feeding him supplements.She's thankful that Embark's age test provided such clear answers, which should help her keep Milo happy and healthy by her side for years to come.Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.Illumina, Friday, January 6, 2023, Press release pictureRachel Miro and her dog, Milo, who goes by @milomutt on Instagram.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734316/Does-Your-Dog-Have-Nine-Lives-Too-This-DNA-Test-Can-Tell-You]"

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Trading At A 25% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-inc-nasdaq-ilmn-trading-130017966.html,1673010017,STORY,['ILMN'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Illumina Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$560.8mUS$807.9mUS$1.22bUS$1.81bUS$2.23bUS$2.54bUS$2.80bUS$3.02bUS$3.21bUS$3.37bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 14.01%Est @ 10.40%Est @ 7.87%Est @ 6.11%Est @ 4.87% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$521US$697US$976US$1.3kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$61bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$61b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$29bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$201, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Illumina as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.941. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

171,fb0a1889-68b1-37cc-977c-1253a57d4b18,SO,2023-01-07,Investing in Southern (NYSE:SO) five years ago would have delivered you a 99% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-southern-nyse-five-years-120104253.html,1673092864,STORY,['SO'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Southern share price has climbed 60% in five years, easily topping the market return of 34% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 8.5% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Southern While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Southern achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 42% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Southern has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Southern, it has a TSR of 99% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Southern has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 8.5% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. However, that falls short of the 15% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Southern is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is potentially serious...But note: Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-attracting-investor-140002925.html,1673013602,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has gained 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share, indicating a change of -40.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -21.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -17.3%. This estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.84 indicates a change of +23.8% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.9 billion and $53.63 billion estimates indicate +6.8% and +7.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $13.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.2%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.62%. The EPS surprise was +30.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

177,ceb43f28-e0ff-33b4-a53e-544401d0b1f6,NKE,2023-01-07,Dow Likely to Continue Outperforming Peers in 2023: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-likely-continue-outperforming-peers-133201027.html,1673011921,STORY,"['COMP', '^GSPC', 'IBM', 'CAT', 'PG', 'NKE']","[Volatility persists in U.S. stock markets after 2022 wrapped up as the worst year since 2008, terminating a three-year winning streak. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year as inflation remained stuck at its 40-year high level. The pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system amid strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli and aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed resulted in almost day-to-day fluctuations.Dow Suffers the Least in 2022Last year, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year and 10.3% from its record high. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% year over year and more than 20% from its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high.The primary concern of the U.S. economy was soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, in 2022, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25%, which took the range of the Fed fund rate to 4.25-4.5%.The Fed terminated the quantitative easing program of buying $120 billion of bonds per month in March and reduced the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet by $364 billion. Consequently, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached as high as 4.33% once a time.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Dow Likely to Repeat Performance in 2023The central bank projected in December that the terminal rate would top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes. This is higher than the September forecast of 4.75%. No rate cut is expected before 2024.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would pursue aggressive interest rate hikes and tighter momentary control policies until inflation comes down to at least near its 2% target level. A marginal decline in the inflation rate has no meaningful implication for the Fed.Story continuesMarket participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward.As a result, growth and momentum stocks are likely to underperform in 2023 and cyclical value stocks will take centerstage. Consequently, the Dow is likely to outperforms its peers in 2023 too.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for 2023 as well as for the long-term (3 to 5 years). Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT’s revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of the ongoing supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. The Construction Industries space is expected to benefit from rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. CAT’s dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives should help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.Caterpillar has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.2% for the current year and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%.salesforce.com inc.

CRM’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market are the other growth drivers. The acquisition of Slack would position salesforce.com as a leader in the enterprise team collaboration solution space and help it compete better with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to witness a CAGR of 12.5% during fiscal 2023-2025.salesforce.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.7% for next year (ending January 2024) and a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.8%.International Business Machines Corp. IBM is likely to witness growth driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. Synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting the competitive position of IBM in the hybrid cloud market.International Business Machines is likely to benefit from the robust adoption and broad-based availability of IBM Blockchain World Wire — a blockchain-driven global payments network aimed at accelerating and optimizing cross-border payments. IBM is also poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on the hybrid cloud strategy.International Business Machines has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.3% for the current year and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG has benefitted from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.

Corporation despite being downgraded to Underweight by a Wells Fargo analyst.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Let's talk about consumer discretionary company right now, and that is VF Corp. That stock is actually trading higher, even after it was downgraded this morning to underweight from equal weight at Wells Fargo. The analysts also lowered the price target of the apparel company from $32 to $24, citing management turnover, balance sheet uncertainty, and the expectation of a difficult first quarter.The stock was actually trading lower in pre-market trading, but perhaps things turned around with the jobs report. Basically, a big reason behind this downgrade is Vans, the classic streetwear and sneaker brand. And the analysts, they're saying, that the uncertainty is simply too much to stomach. That there's a lack of innovation and excitement in core classics over advance.- Yeah. Interim CEO Benno Dorer, a friend of the show, former CEO of Clorox, he's in there running the company now, and I just don't know what the catalyst could be to get VF Corp working again. Is it a sale of a brand internally? Is it a major cost-cutting plan? I know Ben was actively looking into this business. I am sure he will figure it out. But outside of an economic reacceleration to the spring, it's just unclear what is a positive catalyst to get VF working again.- Well, I mean, for Vans, and what we've seen in terms of the rotation in the skateboarder category, you've seen more skateboarders leaning to the either Nike Dunks, the New Balances that have been out there as well, and, really, kind of this overflow of fashion that's made it into that particular sport culture.I think that is something that Vans, for as minimalist and as easy to get into some of those products on a pricing perspective that they were years ago, now that you've seen that rotation from the skateboard culture, that perhaps has hit on Vans. You've also seen more of the overflow from some of the more casual lines of SKUs that they had into things like Crocs as well.And so, just the dispersion that you've seen from the types of buyers that they typically would have had, whether that be on the sport performance front or whether that just be on the casual wear front, I think that's something that could be impacting and have longer term implications for Vans as a subsidiary of VF Corp, which also had given us an update, a business update, at the end of last year in the third quarter of last year, really pointing out that there were some grim times ahead.- Yeah. And just a quick mention, Benno Dorer is still the interim CEO, right? So that's also something that the analyst talks about as not a great time to be going through a transition and not have a permanent CEO. So we'll keep watching that.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 2.28% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 2.13%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.02%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the biggest U.S. mortgage lender had lost 0.38% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Finance sector's loss of 1.02% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.61% in that time.Wells Fargo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 13, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Wells Fargo to post earnings of $0.64 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 53.62%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $19.79 billion, down 5.13% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Wells Fargo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.26% higher. Wells Fargo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Wells Fargo is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 8.38. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.74, so we one might conclude that Wells Fargo is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that WFC currently has a PEG ratio of 0.82. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WFC's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.28 as of yesterday's close.The Banks - Major Regional industry is part of the Finance sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 99, putting it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -53.6%.Revenues are expected to be $19.79 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wells Fargo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $1.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +19.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wells Fargo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That effectively opened the door for many Chinese to travel abroad for the first time since borders slammed shut nearly three years ago, without fear of having to quarantine on their return.More than a dozen countries are now demanding COVID tests from Chinese travellers, as the World Health Organisation said China's official virus data underreported the true extent of its outbreak.Chinese officials and state media have defended the handling of the outbreak, playing down the severity of the surge and denouncing foreign travel requirements for its residents.On Saturday in Hong Kong, people who had made appointments had to queue for about 90 minutes at a centre for PCR tests needed for travel to countries including mainland China.TREATMENT TO THE FOREFor much of the pandemic, China poured resources into a vast PCR testing program to track and trace COVID-19 cases, but the focus is now shifting to vaccines and treatment.In Shanghai, for example, the city government on Friday announced an end to free PCR tests for residents from Jan. 8.A circular published by four government ministries Saturday signalled a reallocation of financial resources to treatment, outlining a plan for public finances to subsidise 60% of treatment costs until March 31.Meanwhile, sources told Reuters that China is in talks with Pfizer Inc to secure a licence that will allow domestic drugmakers to manufacture and distribute a generic version of the U.S. firm's COVID-19 antiviral drug Paxlovid in China.Many Chinese have been attempting to buy the drug abroad and have it shipped to China.On the vaccine front, China's CanSino Biologics Inc announced it has begun trial production for its COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine, known as CS-2034.China has relied on nine domestically-developed COVID vaccines approved for use, including inactivated vaccines, but none have been adapted to target the highly-transmissible Omicron variant and its offshoots currently in circulation.The overall vaccination rate in the country is above 90%, but the rate for adults who have had booster shots drops to 57.9%, and to 42.3% for people aged 80 and older, according to government data released last month.China reported three new COVID deaths in the mainland for Friday, bringing its official virus death toll to 5,267, one of the lowest in the world. International health experts believe Beijing's narrow definition of COVID deaths does not reflect a true toll, and some predict more than a million fatalities this year.

For more, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. And Anjalee, we certainly saw some action in the market today on the heels of this news.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Absolutely. So this is something that we'd been anticipating hoping would come through in terms of Biogen getting its second attempt to get an Alzheimer's treatment through the door of the FDA greenlighting it, as part of a fast track approval. And that's something that has been a point of concern for some experts and some-- and especially medical experts. So let's just recap what happened.We know that the fast track approval is basically for treatments that have unmet need but large population base, just like for Alzheimer's. And millions of individuals, more than 10 million at least, could benefit from this. It's catered towards individuals that have early sort of milder disease and can qualify for milder treatment. It is a twice-- every-two-week treatment. And it's going to cost about $26,500 a year. That is close to Biogen's other treatment, which initially hit the market at a whopping $56,000 a year. Lots of pushback on that Medicare not covering it.So the price point a concern, as you can see on your screen, this is who qualifies. We see, you know, the focus of it. It is the second treatment, not just for Biogen, but also in this class of treatments which is targeting the sticky plaque buildup known as amyloid beta in the brain. And so that is the reason why there is so much to do and ado about this.DAVE BRIGGS: There's rarely good news on Alzheimer's, so let's just savor this for the moment. All right. China continuing to handle an explosion of COVID numbers and now in talks with Pfizer. What's the deal?Story continuesANJALEE KHEMLANI: So China is in works to get a generic version of Paxlovid the antiviral to treat COVID-19. On the market in China, they already just, last week, got to deal with Merck through Sinopharm, their local manufacturer, an exclusive deal to produce that. They already do have Pfizer's Paxlovid in the market. But because of the rise in cases, because of what China is dealing with right now, they're really struggling to meet the demand for treatment.Now, remember, this is a treatment that's given to early disease, early symptom onset, and for typically older individuals, which is a lot of what China is seeing when it comes to the spread of this variant. They do-- they are struggling with a black market right now. So we've got, you know, India's Hetero with producing a generic version already backed by the World Health Organization. And that's already on the market, but it's not approved there. So it's a struggle right there right now for China to get some of these treatments.DAVE BRIGGS: But still, not going anywhere near an mRNA vaccine?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: No.DAVE BRIGGS: Still with your hands off, right?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: We could get into a whole-- that's a whole--DAVE BRIGGS: Right.

197,fc8ea893-cc37-36ca-adbd-64a712c19fb8,IBM,2023-01-07,Why IBM is no longer interested in breaking patent records–and how it plans to measure innovation in the age of open source and quantum computing,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ibm-no-longer-interested-192500998.html,1673033100,STORY,['IBM'],"[For 29 years straight, IBM has led the United States in minting patents, at its peak filing over 10,000 US patent applications in a single year for innovations ranging from the ATM to e-commerce, two-nanometer chips, and quantum computing. It’s been an amazing run–but the new IBM is ready for new challenges.As part of our relentless capacity for reinvention, we decided in 2020 that we would no longer pursue the goal of numeric patent leadership. As a result, 2022 is the first time since 1993 that IBM didn’t claim the top spot on the list of companies with the most U.S. patents.Why, after three decades, such a radical shift? One word: focus.Today, IBM is a hybrid cloud and A.I. company. While we will remain an intellectual property powerhouse with one of the strongest U.S. patent portfolios, as part of our innovation strategy, focus means that we are taking a more selective approach to patenting. We have turned more of our talent and resources towards achieving high-quality, high-impact advancements in the specific areas of hybrid cloud, data and A.I., automation, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing.Patents are only one measure of a company’s true capacity for innovation. IBM will continue to patent new technology, but patents alone are a more incomplete barometer than ever before.Our longstanding commitment to research as part of our business model means we will continue to create the technologies that our clients and the world rely upon. When it comes to the most promising fields in tech–A.I., cloud, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing–innovating requires deep focus. These fields are so dynamic and complex, that we need more hands on deck for each breakthrough.Increasingly, this requires balancing trade secrets and patents alongside a style of R&amp;D called “open innovation”, in which teams from various organizations and institutions collaborate with both internal and external players. They share knowledge openly around well-defined problems and communities.Story continuesTake the example of one of the most fascinating and promising technologies, quantum computing. IBM’s work in quantum computing has been intentionally based on a blend of proprietary and open innovation since day one. Our quantum hardware has always been developed internally and protected by trade secrets and patents. But in 2016, we made the decision to give access to these pioneering quantum computers through the cloud. For the first time ever, quantum computing was no longer the domain of research scientists. Anyone with an internet connection could access the most sophisticated quantum technology in the world. We backed this up by open-sourcing our Qiskit software so developers worldwide could learn how to build quantum applications.This has literally been game-changing. Today, more than 1.5 million people have downloaded the Qiskit software development kit, there are over 450,000 registered IBM Quantum users and researchers have used our technology to write more than 1,700 scientific publications. We’ve worked with academic partners to put quantum computers in Germany and Japan, with more systems to come online in Canada, South Korea, and at the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S.Meanwhile, our IBM Quantum Network stands at more than 200 members, with enterprises from Boeing to HSBC to Mitsubishi Chemical using quantum computers to pursue industry-changing research.We see collaboration, not exclusivity, as the best way to advance the technology and build a quantum industry.This isn’t to say that intellectual property protection, as a concept, is going away. IBM, like most companies, is still going to protect its innovations using copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. You simply can’t do innovation at scale without a thoughtful, proactive IP strategy to protect parts of what you have created. A balanced innovation approach requires that technical teams devote as much energy to open innovation, community building, and delighting customers through great design and user experiences, as they do to protecting their innovations and inventions.Today, there’s really no simple measure that can capture the nature of innovation. However, our experience suggests a few goalposts that can help us do so in this new era.Innovation is a combination of talent, resources, and how the talent applies those resources. That might involve obtaining a patent, contributing to open source, or creating entirely new markets, like the work we are doing to build a quantum industry. And while you can’t quantify it in terms of patent numbers or even R&amp;D dollars, progress will become obvious as the life-changing applications of these exciting new technologies continue to tick up.That’s why we’re betting that you should account for the real-world impact of a given technology–not just how many patents were issued while building it.Darío Gil, Ph.D., is IBM's SVP and the director of IBM Research.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:Will the U.S. and Europe slide into recession in 2023? Here’s how to look out when economic outlooks don’tBiggest CEO successes and setbacks: 2022’s triumphs and 2023’s challengesI have 10 minutes to clean a plane before passengers board.

Technologies such as semiconductors and hardware memory saw the largest drop in IBM patents, though the reduction was across all major types.The decline reflects a strategy shift begun in 2020 to focus the IP portfolio on IBM’s core businesses and free engineers from the time-consuming patent process, said Dario Gil, head of IBM Research, in an interview. “We decided to no longer pursue numeric patent leadership, but remain an intellectual property powerhouse and continue to have one of the strongest portfolios in the world in our priority technologies.”The Armonk, New York-based company has long prided itself on patent leadership — it said it had the highest number of patents for the last 29 years. IP licensing and development has also been lucrative: IBM has generated more than $27 billion in IP income since 1996, according to filings. In recent years, however, that money has slowed down as some companies have resisted licensing fees.For more: IBM’s Patent Income Slips as Companies Resist ‘Godfather’ DealsBut IBM isn’t done monetizing its intellectual property, Gil said. “On the priority areas — hybrid cloud, AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, quantum — we will continue to patent and defend that aggressively.”Story continuesThe shift mirrors IBM’s broader transformation away from hardware and legacy infrastructure toward cloud services and software. Under Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the company has made more than 25 acquisitions since April 2020, including artificial-intelligent software powerhouse Red Hat. IBM in November 2021 spun off a large portion of its infrastructure services business into a company called Kyndryl Holdings Inc. The spinoff, however, wasn’t a reason for the patent decline in 2022, Gil said.IBM has been a relative haven in the tech market meltdown, rallying 5.4% in 2022 compared with a 33% dip in the Nasdaq 100 index. In the most recent earnings report, the company beat sales estimates and affirmed its cash flow forecast.Samsung has long been the runner-up before last year, being issued more than 8,000 new patents a year since 2017, according to Harrity’s list. It was often awarded patents on visual display systems and voice communication.Chinese technology firms like TikTok parent ByteDance Ltd. and internet firm Baidu Inc. saw some of the steepest increases in patent issuance on the list. For example, ByteDance has applied for a patent on a method of adding special effects to human bodies on video, commonly used in TikTok filters. Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. also saw large increases.“Patent filings in china have been exploding for years,” Harrity analytics chief Rocky Berndsen said. “So as more of these companies do business in the US we would expect the numbers to increase here as well.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Aggressive Chip Strategy Forces China Into a CornerUsed-Car Prices Are Finally DroppingAfter the GOP’s Strife, the Big Winner Might Be Joe BidenThe Great American EV Battery Revolution Might Finally Be HerePoland’s Election Provides a Path Out of EU Isolation©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

In order to combat mounting inflation, in 2022, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25%, which took the range of the Fed fund rate to 4.25-4.5%.The Fed terminated the quantitative easing program of buying $120 billion of bonds per month in March and reduced the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet by $364 billion. Consequently, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached as high as 4.33% once a time.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Dow Likely to Repeat Performance in 2023The central bank projected in December that the terminal rate would top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes. This is higher than the September forecast of 4.75%. No rate cut is expected before 2024.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would pursue aggressive interest rate hikes and tighter momentary control policies until inflation comes down to at least near its 2% target level. A marginal decline in the inflation rate has no meaningful implication for the Fed.Story continuesMarket participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward.As a result, growth and momentum stocks are likely to underperform in 2023 and cyclical value stocks will take centerstage. Consequently, the Dow is likely to outperforms its peers in 2023 too.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for 2023 as well as for the long-term (3 to 5 years). Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES Corporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES Corporation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 51 cents per share to 48 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AES Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

While the concept has “grand saloon” style doors that open out, and likely will not appear in the production version, one feature likely to remain is the what Ram is calling an industry-first feature: third-row jump seats.Ram Revolution 1500 EV Concept (credit: Ram)Ram says the truck’s powered mid-gate can retract and reveal mounted jump seats, which can also be removed to allow multiple flexible seating configurations. Ram also says when the mid-gate is retracted, the full length of the car is available for long cargo, enabling a pass-through (that includes the frunk) that can fit objects up to 18-ft. long.Ram says the concept is based on the STLA Frame body-on-frame chassis that was built specifically for electric vehicles, and in this case it will feature two electric drive modules (EDMs) in order to provide all-wheel drive.No other specs were given at the reveal, but one would expect the truck to feature similar features to the competition along with similar pricing.Ram Revolution 1500 EV Concept (credit: Ram)Ram says it faced a number of challenges creating the EV pickup to appeal to its customers. “First of all battery packaging, because the batteries are very, very heavy,” said Mike Koval, Ram Brands CEO, about one of the biggest challenges, in an interview with Yahoo Finance from Las Vegas.“I think research continues to suggest and support that trucking intenders, and even current buyers, are more and more openminded to the idea of electrification in their pickups, but they tell us time and time again, please do not compromise, do not sacrifice the core attributes that we care about the most — which historically had been payload and towing,” Koval said.Story continuesKoval said range and charge time are key customer desires, so Ram engineers had to create an architecture that would be able to support the battery weight.Because of the smaller electric motors used, Ram engineers could expand the cabin by 4 inches, which in the automotive world is huge for creating more space and luxury in the cabin. Ram trucks are known for some of the best, if not the best, interiors of any truck series, and Koval says their customers expect that part of equation to remain in any truck they make.Ram Revolution 1500 EV Concept (credit: Ram)Koval says its creature comforts like a larger cabin, flexibility of the Revolution EV for mixed use cases, battery capacity (which some rumor could be 500 miles), and propulsion systems (a hybrid range extender truck may be in the works), will help it win on the sales floor.“I think that's ultimately what's gonna help differentiate RAM from the other guys is we're going to bring a better suite of solutions to the marketplace from 2024, that I think will better meet real world customer needs, as we transition into electrification,” he says.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

211,e24f7967-c3db-3d0c-bec7-9f0419cdb0bb,PNC,2023-01-07,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-141002594.html,1673014202,STORY,['PNC'],"[Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself.And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last. People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.57 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.17%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.69%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 10.2%. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Preferred Bank (PFBC) is paying out a dividend of $0.55 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.09% compared to the Banks - West industry's yield of 2.46% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 13.16% over the past year. Check Preferred Bank (PFBC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 3.76%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.28% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio: they can help lessen the effects of inflation, since many dividend-paying companies (especially blue chip stocks) generally increase their dividends over time.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.62%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc was expected to post earnings of $3.66 per share, but it reported $3.78 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.28%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.11 per share, while it actually produced $3.42 per share, a surprise of 9.97%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 18, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

216,1ddde3cb-5ffe-3ed7-b258-ed8904fa6fa2,TGT,2023-01-07,E.l.f. Beauty and Target have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-target-141002269.html,1673014202,STORY,"['TGT', '^GSPC', 'PXD', 'MTDR']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 6, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares E.l.f. Beauty ELF as the Bull of the Day and Target TGT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. PXD and Matador Resources Company’s MTDR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:E.l.f. Beauty stock soared in 2022 as the low-priced makeup seller attracts more customers than ever amid 40-year high inflation. E.l.f. Beauty has crushed quarterly earnings estimates and continued to raise its outlook, which is no easy task amid the current economic environment.E.l.f. Beauty is also standing out in the wider cosmetics industry that is benefiting from a return to normal life and a well-established trend known as the lipstick effect during economic downturns.Beauty Is BoomingE.l.f. Beauty started in 2004. The firm quickly began to shake up the industry by selling premium cosmetics for $1 over the internet. A lot has changed since then and the brand caught on as the digital economy boomed. Many consumers are also always looking for high quality at a lower cost in an industry full of huge markups and sky-high costs. ELF then went public in 2016.E.l.f. Beauty, which stands for eyes, lips and face, stands out in a crowded space by selling its cosmetic offerings for much lower prices than high-end competitors. The company’s brands include e.l.f., e.l.f. Skin, Well People, and Keys Soulcare.E.l.f. Beauty’s revenue climbed 6% during the heart of the pandemic in its fiscal year 2020 and began to really climb during the last several years as people returned to their normal lives.E.l.f. Beauty’s executive team has navigated inflation better than most. The firm has kept some of its price points nearly unchanged, while raising its prices on many items and introducing higher-end products to help margins as companies around the economy saw their profits crunched. E.l.f. Beauty’s quality-meets-low-cost approach is now more attractive than ever.Story continuesRecent Strength &amp; OutlookThe firm destroyed our adjusted Q2 FY23 earnings estimates on November 2 by 125%, for its seventh straight beat. E.l.f. Beauty posted its 15th straight quarter of revenue growth as well, and, most importantly, it raised its guidance for its fiscal 2023 as the overall outlook for S&amp;P 500 earnings fades.The firm also said that it gained 115 basis points of market share during the period. On top of that, e.l.f. Beauty’s gross margin increased by 1.9% to 65% last quarter. The boosted margins were primarily driven by “price increases, cost savings and product mix, partially offset by inventory adjustments and higher transportation costs.”ELF’s adjusted earnings outlook has skyrocketed for FY23 and FY24, as the nearby chart showcases. Zacks estimates call for e.l.f. Beauty’s fiscal 2023 revenue to climb 25% to $488.9 million and then jump another 12% in FY24 to $544.9 million. This growth would come on top of 23% sales expansion in ELF’s FY22 and 13% in FY21.E.l.f. Beauty’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 33% in its fiscal 2023 to $1.12 per share and then pop by an additional 11% in FY24. Plus, ELF has topped our EPS estimates by an average of 93% in the trailing four periods and its most recent EPS estimate for FY24 comes in 9% higher than the current consensus.Other FundamentalsE.l.f. Beauty is part of the Cosmetics industry that currently ranks in the top 14% of over 250 Zacks industries. The group includes Coty (COTY), L'Oréal S.A. (LRLCY), and others. It is worth noting that studies have shown that 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its industry. The Zacks Cosmetics industry has climbed 11% in the last three months, with ELF shares up 45%.ELF’s recent run is part of a 78% climb over the last 12 months vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 19% fall. The stock has also soared 260% in the last three years vs. the larger Zacks Consumer Staples Market’s 1% and the S&amp;P 500’s 19%.E.l.f. Beauty hit fresh highs of $57 per share on January 4. Some investors might be nervous about buying at new highs. But ELF’s ability to climb as large swaths of the market continue to tumble is highly impressive. And sticking with what has already worked during the economic uncertainty could serve investors well in 2023.E.l.f. Beauty’s valuation levels might be a bit high for many investors, especially for a makeup company during a rising earnings environment. But ELF is still trading 25% below its own three-year highs and right at its median during this stretch. And it sits near neutral levels in terms of the relative strength index (RSI).ELF also sports a strong balance sheet and 10 of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” or “Buys,” with no “Sells.” On top of that, there is an established phenomenon known as the lipstick effect that showcases a willingness for consumers to buy small, fun things when people can’t splurge on big-ticket items.Bottom LineE.l.f. Beauty’s strong earnings estimate revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. Positive earnings revisions are always helpful indicators of companies heading in the right direction. The current economic and market environment makes ELF and other stocks with strong growth outlooks and improving earnings estimates even more attractive.Bear of the Day:Target stock was a pandemic and post-covid superstar. Target, like many others, failed to adapt to quickly changing consumer shopping patterns that caused it to suffer a rough 2022, full of inventory issues, lagging sales, and more.Target’s earnings outlook has continued to plummet for FY22, FY23, and FY24, with TGT shares tumbling alongside its fading EPS estimates.Although Target’s long-term outlook remains intact, now might not be the best time to dive back into TGT, especially with the U.S. economy in the midst of a downturn.Not Pandemic Shoppers AnymoreInvestors first hammered Target stock after its Q1 FY22 earnings release for TGT’s inability to navigate rising freight costs and more. Alongside its bottom-line miss, Wall Street also hated Target’s initial decision to absorb higher costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart got hit hard for a similar report at the time.Target got stuck dealing with inventory issues because the firm simply had too much of the wrong stuff on hand. Consumers spent well over a year buying all of the furniture, appliances, TVs, and other big-ticket items that they needed.Target was forced to discount items and take other measures to offload its access inventory. Fast forward to TGT’s third quarter release in November, and Wall Street got more bad news. TGT lowered its guidance once again as consumers continued to pull back on spending.Target is continuing to offer discounts in an effort to attract shoppers to discretionary items. “We know they are spending more dollars on food and beverage and household essentials, and as they are shopping for discretionary categories they are looking for promotions,” CEO Brian Cornell said on TGT’s Q3 earnings call.The inflationary crunch on shoppers is hitting Target harder than rival Walmart because TGT’s business is made up more heavily of these discretionary items that people have cut out of their budgets.TGT’s consensus earnings estimate for FY22 is down 32% since its Q3 release alone and way more since the start of 2022. Plus, its outlook for fiscal 2023 is now 21% lower, with FY24 trending heavily in the wrong direction as well.Bottom LineTarget’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And Zacks estimates call for its adjusted earnings to fall 59% YoY in fiscal 2022 and then come in well below its FY21 levels in fiscal 2023. And its most recent EPS estimates are coming in beneath the current consensus.Target has also missed our adjusted earnings estimates by an average of 33% in the trailing three quarters. TGT is the Bear of the Day given its near-term outlook and the continued unknowns ahead on the consumer spending and inflation fronts.Target does remain a possible long-term play given its overall standing and strength within a key segment of the consumer-driven U.S. economy. And Target stock is down about 40% from its highs. But TGT just surged off oversold RSI levels a few weeks ago and some investors might want to wait for a slightly better entry point.Additional content:3 Permian Explorers in Focus on Healthy Oil PricesSince the beginning of this year, oil explorers and producers have focused their attention on shale resources following a favorable crude pricing environment. The count of rigs will likely keep increasing since oil price is expected to remain healthy. Thus, with rising drilling activities, production may increase, aiding upstream energy players' businesses.Oil Price Still HighWest Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than $70 per barrel, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Also, in its short-term energy outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) projected the average spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude at $95.22 per barrel this year, significantly higher than $68.21 in 2021.Shale Oil Production to RiseIn January, total oil production from shale resources in the United States will likely increase by 94,000 barrels per day to 9,319 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/D), per EIA. The shale resources comprise Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Niobrara and Permian.Of all the resources, the Permian will witness the highest increase in daily oil production this month, according to the EIA’s drilling productivity report. In the Permian, the EIA projects oil production to rise by 37,000 barrels per day to 5,579 MBbls/D in January.Permian Explorers in the SpotlightIt has been crystal clear that a favorable crude pricing scenario is backing higher production volumes. Improving Permian production amid healthy oil prices has raised the incentive to keep an eye on stocks of companies operating in the most prolific basin.3 Stocks to GainDiamondback Energy, Inc. is a leading pure-play Permian operator. The firm, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will be expanding its footprint in the Midland basin since it recently signed a definitive purchase agreement for acquiring all leasehold interest and associated properties of Lario Permian, LLC – which is a wholly owned affiliate of Lario Oil &amp; Gas Company. FANG also has an investment-grade balance sheet.Pioneer Natural Resources Co. has a strong presence in the low-cost oil-rich Midland basin — a sub-basin of the broader Permian. The #3 Ranked upstream energy player has a massive inventory of premium wells that will likely generate significant returns for the company.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pioneer Natural is focused on returning capital to shareholders. This includes a substantial variable dividend along with a strong base dividend. PXD is also employing opportunistic share repurchases to reward shareholders.Pioneer Natural has considerably lower exposure to debt capital than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. This reflects PXD’s strong balance sheet on which the firm can rely to sail through the volatile energy businesses.Solid oil prices are a boon for Matador Resources Company’s upstream operations. This is because MTDR has a strong presence in oil-rich core acres of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin. Favorable oil prices are likely to aid it in increasing production volumes. For 2022, the upstream energy player with a Zacks Rank of 3 expects total production of 37.7-38.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoE), higher than 31.5 MMBoE in 2021.On another positive note, Matador plans to turn to sales a net of 71 wells this year, including operated and non-operated wells. The prime priorities that MTDR has set for this year are lowering debt levels, delivering free cashflows and maintaining or increasing dividends.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

217,75a03ca8-fc27-35cd-bb9e-30e9d7b35980,WRK,2023-01-07,WestRock Company's (NYSE:WRK) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 90% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/westrock-companys-nyse-wrk-intrinsic-140207161.html,1673013727,STORY,['WRK'],"[How far off is WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for WestRock The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.22bUS$1.22bUS$1.21bUS$1.20bUS$1.20bUS$1.21bUS$1.22bUS$1.24bUS$1.26bUS$1.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Est @ -1.62%Est @ -0.54%Est @ 0.21%Est @ 0.74%Est @ 1.11%Est @ 1.37%Est @ 1.56%Est @ 1.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$946US$868US$802US$746US$695US$650US$609US$571(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.1bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.0%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$9.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$35.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at WestRock as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.069. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for WestRockStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Packaging industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Packaging market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 2 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For WestRock, we've put together three relevant elements you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for CSX How Fast Is CSX Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. CSX managed to grow EPS by 11% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While CSX did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for CSX.Story continuesAre CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of CSX, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$58m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Does CSX Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of CSX is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for CSX that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

It’s Me, Margaret, About My Father, The Blackening, the untitled Adele Lim comedy, White Bird: A Wonder Story, The Expendables 4, the next installment of the billion-dollar box office Saw franchise and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes are also lined up.The partnership is expected to provide Lionsgate with a wider audience in Canada and thus aid its top line.Lionsgate to Face Headwinds Despite ExpansionsWith covid restrictions being lifted, and the footfalls at movie multiplexes reviving, Lionsgate has been making great efforts to expand its presence globally and cater to a larger audience.Recently it teamed up with a renowned multiplex in India, PVR Cinemas, to release its Hollywood slate in the country. This emerging economy has been witnessing a shift in customer preferences toward Hollywood movies and hence aims to benefit from it.What could be attributing this expansion is Lionsgate’s decision of spinning off its studio from Starz, its cable network company. This was primarily done to allow Lionsgate to invest its monetary resources and time to focus on individual businesses and bolster its growth.Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Price and ConsensusLions Gate Entertainment Corp. Price and ConsensusLions Gate Entertainment Corp. price-consensus-chart | Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. QuoteHowever, a major headwind that Lionsgate is facing and will continue to face is from the streaming industries that are capturing the markets as people are gradually shifting their preferences toward watching movies online in their comfort.

BBBY plunged 30% during the close of the trading session on Jan 5, following its revelation of drab preliminary results for third-quarter fiscal 2022.In the quarter, the company leveraged the liquidity gained from the holiday season to pursue higher in-stock levels. Meanwhile, it collaborated with suppliers, and undertook productive merchandise plans and store fleet optimization plans. However, these efforts failed to bear fruits.The fiscal third-quarter results were impacted by inventory constraints and reduced credit limits, which led to lower levels of in-stock presentation within the assortments.Based on lower customer traffic and reduced levels of inventory availability, management anticipates net sales of $1.26 billion, whereas it reported $1.88 billion in the year-ago period. The company also envisions a net loss of $385.8 million, including impairment charges of $100 million, whereas the company reported a loss of $276.4 million in the year-ago quarter. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to be $583.6 million, whereas it reported $698.0 million in the year-ago period, driven by cost-optimization initiatives.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond also highlighted that it is on track with turnaround plans, with an increased focus on merchandising and inventory, enhancing digital and omni-capabilities, and strengthening its financial position. It is also making efforts to improve its cash position and mitigate any potential liquidity shortfall.But the turnaround plans do not seem to work much for the retailer. According to sources, the company’s dismal outlook has led to suppliers halting shipments. This is likely to further affect its financial situation.That said, BBBY raised concerns about its ability to continue based on recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations for the nine months ended Nov 26, 2022. Consequently, BBBY is currently exploring all alternatives, including restructuring debt, seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying the company's business activities and strategic initiatives, selling assets, and filing for bankruptcy.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 87.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%.ConclusionBBBY has been on a downhill ride for nearly a decade, as evident from its sluggish sales and inability to compete with other retail giants and a shift to private brands. This drove away many loyal customers, who were looking for their favorite brands. However, the company has started to bring back some of the well-known national brands, such as Oxo, Ninja and SodaStream, as part of its turnaround efforts.All said, we hope that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond will be able to come out of the woods soon.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider, namely Wingstop WING, Ross Stores ROST and Technoglass TGLS.Ross Stores, an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

232,1b28b357-7c4b-3979-88df-6df58e70a703,VZ,2023-01-07,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-attracting-140002615.html,1673013602,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +12.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating a change of -7.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -3.9%. This estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.05 indicates a change of -2.6% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $136.75 billion and $139.01 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +1.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

233,0ab8b609-29f1-36ad-ac1c-81d74c3faefe,SWK,2023-01-07,7 Must-Buy Dividend Stocks for Your January Buy List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-buy-dividend-stocks-192031285.html,1672773631,STORY,"['FLO', 'SWK', 'VZ', 'NDSN', 'PEP', 'JNJ', 'CL']","[While a turbulent year  behind us, it’s a good time to start looking for dividend stocks to buy. The Federal Reserve is not done raising interest rates, and there is a consensus that the terminal rate could reach 5%. Thus, a lot of volatility and a possible recession still lie ahead. That being said, it’s essential to include dividend stocks in your portfolio. There are many dividend stocks, but some are exceptionally resistant to recessionary pressures.Thus, I have picked companies with inelastic and relevant businesses with historical and fundamental resilience to a future recession. The following seven dividend stocks will maintain dividends and generate passive income even during harsh economic conditions.CLColgate-Palmolive$78.52NDSNNordson Corp.$237.36FLOFlowers Foods$28.50VZVerizon$39.90SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$75.32JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$177.30PEPPepsiCo$178.49Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is among the most stable long-term dividend stocks to buy. The company’s stability is remarkable as the demand for consumer staples is highly inelastic, especially if it’s for essential products such as toothpaste. Of course, the stock offers little upside due to its entrenched business. But Colgate-Palmolive’s long-term stability will keep it trading at a premium for a long time and help it maintain a healthy dividend yield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs for financials, its profits have slightly declined by 2.5% in Q3 of last year. However, once margin compression stops and the supply setbacks are fully resolved, I expect profits to grow along with the top line. The company has 60 years of consecutive increases in dividends and has a forward dividend yield of 2.39%.Nordson Corp. (NDSN)An image of US currencySource: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comNordson Corp. (NASDAQ:NDSN) is a leading global manufacturer of precision dispensing equipment, fluid management systems, and related technologies. The company has a diversified portfolio of products and services that cater to a wide range of industries, including packaging, electronics, medical, and automotive. Nordson has been in business since 1954, and since then, it has grown to become a major global player in its field.Story continuesThe company is well-known for its strong financial performance and robust balance sheet. Nordson’s margins are especially impressive, with a net margin of 19.81%, better than 92.49% of 2768 companies in the industrial products industry.Conversely, the company’s dividend yield of 1.09% is less robust, but it has consistently increased over the years. However, this is substituted by the company’s stock performance. NDSN stock is up nearly 60% in the past five years and is only down 5.3% in the past 365 days. Thus, the company offers dividends in addition to its robust performance, making it more appealing.Flowers Foods (FLO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIf you are looking for dividend stocks to buy with a perfect balance of short-term risk, long-term gains, and robust financials, Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) should be your top pick. The cons of this stock are almost negligible, which is why I routinely include this market idea in my articles.First, FLO stock is up 51%-plus in the last five years. Zoom out further, and you can see that the stock has been almost on an unbroken long-term uptrend for the last twenty-two years. Holders of this stock are essentially matching the S&amp;P500’s gain while risking minimal long-term downside, as it has gained 4.62% in the past year. Even better, Flowers Foods has a dividend yield of 3.06%.Second, the company’s financials are highly consistent. The company’s top line is growing at a two-digit clip and accelerating in this environment, while its profits grew 5.13% despite margins declining. With that in mind, FLO is undoubtedly among the top dividend stocks to buy for 2023.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is generally seen as an underperformer with little upside. However, last year’s selloff has turned VZ into a value stock that investors should start taking seriously. Sure, its profits are down by nearly a quarter. But it should be noted that the company has a well-established business that will remain relevant for years. Furthermore, its top line continues to grow while the company expands into new communications technology segments, such as broadband. The government is keen to develop and broaden internet infrastructure across the U.S., and Verizon is set to benefit from that ambition.Simply put, a company with Verizon’s growth prospects and prominence merit a much higher valuation. I believe its current trough is an excellent buy opportunity and could pay off massively in the long run. Verizon’s forward dividend yield of 6.62% and 18 years of consecutive dividend increases are just icing on the cake.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a Fortune 500 American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and a provider of security products. Its stock is near a decade low after the selloff last year, and it seems set to u-turn this year.Its financials are turning a corner after both its top, and bottom lines outperformed expectations. Revenue grew 9% in Q3 2022, while profits grew 104%. Margins have also recovered sharply, and SWK stock is bottoming out after a 67% decline from its peak and is now changing hands at 8.24 times earnings.Additionally, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has a dividend yield of 4.26% with 55 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, SWK stock looks highly oversold and should be among the top market ideas for your dividend stocks to buy list.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockIf you are looking for safer stocks similar to FLO and CL, consider Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). It is a household name that I don’t need to discuss much further except that the company has a remarkably well-established business with highly profitable inelastic segments. The company’s top line is slowing down but remains robust while its profits have picked up again. It also has a healthy dividend yield of 2.56% and a notable net margin of 20%, ranked better than 88.45% of 1056 companies in the drug manufacturing industry.All things considered, Johnson &amp; Johnson is among the safest dividend stocks to buy. The company’s robust profits and stability will allow it to pay dividends while growing for the foreseeable future.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the safest and least volatile among the seven dividend stocks to buy for 2023. It is also dividend king with 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, which makes it even more appealing. The company has a long history of weathering economic storms that will continue to give PEP a substantial edge among other safe stocks. Its business is highly diversified into inelastic segments, and its products will remain relevant for decades.Furthermore, PepsiCo’s dividend yield of 2.55%, combined with its impressive net margin of 11.61%, ranked better than 81.65% of 109 companies in the non-alcoholic beverages industry, making it an attractive option for investors looking for value and long-term capital appreciation. The company’s 3-year revenue growth rate also sits at a healthy 8% clip, in the top 25% in its industry.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $25.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Semiconductor – General industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 82 cents per share to 81 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Novartis (NVS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 26 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.42 a share.NVS has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.42 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41.NVS is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at McKesson (MCK) as well.McKesson, which is readying to report earnings on February 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $6.38 a share, and MCK is 26 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson is $6.34, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.58%.Story continuesNVS and MCK's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It might not last much longer.Gov. Ron DeSantis, widely expected to run for president next year, intensified his feud with Disney on Friday with a plan to take control of the governing board for the company’s sprawling Florida property—and make the entertainment giant assume $700 million in outstanding debt.Walt Disney World has enjoyed the privileges of a special governing district, called Reedy Creek, since 1967.“The corporate kingdom has come to an end,” said Taryn Fenske, communications director for the governor, in a statement. “Under the proposed legislation, Disney will no longer control its own government, will live under the same laws as everyone else, will be responsible for their outstanding debts, and will pay their fair share of taxes.”A notice posted to the Osceola County website suggested the proposed legislation would leave almost no aspect of Reedy Creek untouched. The special district borders Osceola and Orange counties.A state-controlled board, Fenske added, would ensure that Orange County cannot use Reedy Creek–related issues “as a pretext to raise taxes on Orange County residents.”In April, DeSantis signed a law, drafted by state lawmakers in a special session, to dissolve all special districts like Reedy Creek by June 2023. How that legislation will mesh with the new proposal was not immediately clear. The move was triggered by what the Republican governor saw as Disney’s criticism of a law he signed—dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by detractors—that limits elementary school teachings about gender identity.“Disney can no longer have its own government and own taxing authority, and Disney—not taxpayers—will have to be responsible for any financial consequences,” DeSantis’s former chief of staff, Adrian Lukis, told Fox News. “While this will be painful for Disney, I expect businesses throughout the state will be proud of their governor for making it clear that he doesn’t care who you are, or how politically connected you may be—no one gets special treatment in Florida.”Story continuesFortune reached out to Disney but did not receive an immediate reply. Fox News first reported on the Friday development, citing sources in the governor’s office.In his feud with Disney, DeSantis has shown a combative side that has resonated widely among Republicans, and many expect him to announce a presidential run this year, probably after Florida’s legislative session in the spring or summer. Various polls show the governor leading ex-President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup for the GOP nomination, while in November Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated he’d support a DeSantis run for the White House.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: San Francisco being hit with a ‘brutal’ storm so severe that a meteorologist says is ‘one of the most impactful’ he’s ever seenHow will the ultrawealthy ride out the recession? 1,200 investors worth $130 billion have one big strategyBlaming Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the COVID vaccine is ‘wildly and irresponsibly speculative,’ says expertMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand]"

This helps Roku retain its number-one position in streaming platforms in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Roku has immensely benefitted from the ongoing cord-cutting as consumers are shifting their preference to TV streaming. Per Zippia, the estimated cord cutters in America in 2022 have been around 4.9 million. For the first time in 2022, time spent on streaming had surpassed cable, according to Nielsen.It is also expected that cable TV subscribers could fall from 71 million in 2020 to 56 million in 2025. This provides a wide opportunity for streaming platforms like Roku.Roku to Gain From Its Streaming ContentBesides cord cutting, there are other parameters that could further aid growth at Roku. Being a streaming operating system, Roku is home to top OTT platforms like Netflix NFLX and Walt Disney DIS. Both these companies have launched their advertising video-on-demand model recently. This makes Netflix and Disney+ available to users at a decreased price and is expected to gain traction.The growing userbase for Netflix and Disney would also increase engagement at Roku’s operating system and thus could further boost its top line.Roku, Inc.

It is expected that this threat will persist in the upcoming quarters as well and since the Roku channel’s revenues are solely dependent on ads, it might hurt its top line.Shares of Roku have declined 78% in the last year compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 31.9% in the same period.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderRoku currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Liberty Media FWONK sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Liberty Media’s share price decreased 2.6% year over year.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB), since the last five years saw the share price fall 18%. In the last ninety days we've seen the share price slide 20%.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, M&amp;T Bank actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 1.1% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Given that EPS has increased, but the share price has fallen, it's fair to say that market sentiment around the stock has become more negative. Generally speaking, though, if the company can keep growing EPS then the share price will eventually follow.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on M&amp;T Bank's earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, M&amp;T Bank's TSR for the last 5 years was -5.8%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that M&amp;T Bank shares lost 15% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 20%. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it's worse than the annualised loss of 1.1% over the last half decade. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'.

254,0ab8b609-29f1-36ad-ac1c-81d74c3faefe,CL,2023-01-07,7 Must-Buy Dividend Stocks for Your January Buy List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-buy-dividend-stocks-192031285.html,1672773631,STORY,"['FLO', 'SWK', 'VZ', 'NDSN', 'PEP', 'JNJ', 'CL']","[While a turbulent year  behind us, it’s a good time to start looking for dividend stocks to buy. The Federal Reserve is not done raising interest rates, and there is a consensus that the terminal rate could reach 5%. Thus, a lot of volatility and a possible recession still lie ahead. That being said, it’s essential to include dividend stocks in your portfolio. There are many dividend stocks, but some are exceptionally resistant to recessionary pressures.Thus, I have picked companies with inelastic and relevant businesses with historical and fundamental resilience to a future recession. The following seven dividend stocks will maintain dividends and generate passive income even during harsh economic conditions.CLColgate-Palmolive$78.52NDSNNordson Corp.$237.36FLOFlowers Foods$28.50VZVerizon$39.90SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$75.32JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$177.30PEPPepsiCo$178.49Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is among the most stable long-term dividend stocks to buy. The company’s stability is remarkable as the demand for consumer staples is highly inelastic, especially if it’s for essential products such as toothpaste. Of course, the stock offers little upside due to its entrenched business. But Colgate-Palmolive’s long-term stability will keep it trading at a premium for a long time and help it maintain a healthy dividend yield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs for financials, its profits have slightly declined by 2.5% in Q3 of last year. However, once margin compression stops and the supply setbacks are fully resolved, I expect profits to grow along with the top line. The company has 60 years of consecutive increases in dividends and has a forward dividend yield of 2.39%.Nordson Corp. (NDSN)An image of US currencySource: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comNordson Corp. (NASDAQ:NDSN) is a leading global manufacturer of precision dispensing equipment, fluid management systems, and related technologies. The company has a diversified portfolio of products and services that cater to a wide range of industries, including packaging, electronics, medical, and automotive. Nordson has been in business since 1954, and since then, it has grown to become a major global player in its field.Story continuesThe company is well-known for its strong financial performance and robust balance sheet. Nordson’s margins are especially impressive, with a net margin of 19.81%, better than 92.49% of 2768 companies in the industrial products industry.Conversely, the company’s dividend yield of 1.09% is less robust, but it has consistently increased over the years. However, this is substituted by the company’s stock performance. NDSN stock is up nearly 60% in the past five years and is only down 5.3% in the past 365 days. Thus, the company offers dividends in addition to its robust performance, making it more appealing.Flowers Foods (FLO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIf you are looking for dividend stocks to buy with a perfect balance of short-term risk, long-term gains, and robust financials, Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) should be your top pick. The cons of this stock are almost negligible, which is why I routinely include this market idea in my articles.First, FLO stock is up 51%-plus in the last five years. Zoom out further, and you can see that the stock has been almost on an unbroken long-term uptrend for the last twenty-two years. Holders of this stock are essentially matching the S&amp;P500’s gain while risking minimal long-term downside, as it has gained 4.62% in the past year. Even better, Flowers Foods has a dividend yield of 3.06%.Second, the company’s financials are highly consistent. The company’s top line is growing at a two-digit clip and accelerating in this environment, while its profits grew 5.13% despite margins declining. With that in mind, FLO is undoubtedly among the top dividend stocks to buy for 2023.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is generally seen as an underperformer with little upside. However, last year’s selloff has turned VZ into a value stock that investors should start taking seriously. Sure, its profits are down by nearly a quarter. But it should be noted that the company has a well-established business that will remain relevant for years. Furthermore, its top line continues to grow while the company expands into new communications technology segments, such as broadband. The government is keen to develop and broaden internet infrastructure across the U.S., and Verizon is set to benefit from that ambition.Simply put, a company with Verizon’s growth prospects and prominence merit a much higher valuation. I believe its current trough is an excellent buy opportunity and could pay off massively in the long run. Verizon’s forward dividend yield of 6.62% and 18 years of consecutive dividend increases are just icing on the cake.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a Fortune 500 American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and a provider of security products. Its stock is near a decade low after the selloff last year, and it seems set to u-turn this year.Its financials are turning a corner after both its top, and bottom lines outperformed expectations. Revenue grew 9% in Q3 2022, while profits grew 104%. Margins have also recovered sharply, and SWK stock is bottoming out after a 67% decline from its peak and is now changing hands at 8.24 times earnings.Additionally, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has a dividend yield of 4.26% with 55 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, SWK stock looks highly oversold and should be among the top market ideas for your dividend stocks to buy list.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockIf you are looking for safer stocks similar to FLO and CL, consider Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). It is a household name that I don’t need to discuss much further except that the company has a remarkably well-established business with highly profitable inelastic segments. The company’s top line is slowing down but remains robust while its profits have picked up again. It also has a healthy dividend yield of 2.56% and a notable net margin of 20%, ranked better than 88.45% of 1056 companies in the drug manufacturing industry.All things considered, Johnson &amp; Johnson is among the safest dividend stocks to buy. The company’s robust profits and stability will allow it to pay dividends while growing for the foreseeable future.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the safest and least volatile among the seven dividend stocks to buy for 2023. It is also dividend king with 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, which makes it even more appealing. The company has a long history of weathering economic storms that will continue to give PEP a substantial edge among other safe stocks. Its business is highly diversified into inelastic segments, and its products will remain relevant for decades.Furthermore, PepsiCo’s dividend yield of 2.55%, combined with its impressive net margin of 11.61%, ranked better than 81.65% of 109 companies in the non-alcoholic beverages industry, making it an attractive option for investors looking for value and long-term capital appreciation. The company’s 3-year revenue growth rate also sits at a healthy 8% clip, in the top 25% in its industry.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It is just the start of how MedWand can be deployed to support tele-triage and remote patient monitoring—all integrated with existing healthcare provider workflows and software.""According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 3.5 billion people—almost half the world's population—lack access to the health services needed, with almost 100 million people pushed to extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket expenses [1]. Leading the way in delivering virtual healthcare solutions to clinicians and patients, MedWand's VirtualCare platform provides advanced hub-and-spoke telemedicine services to connect an urban medical center with multiple rural, or inner-city communities, equipped with MedWand Mobile Clinics.Story continuesFacilitating the mission to enable clinical examinations from any location at any time, customizable MedWand Clinics, VirtualCare platform, and Command Center monitoring station are complemented by IoT connectivity from AT&amp;T, mobile computing devices from HP, and cloud infrastructure services from Oracle.Introduced at CES, the innovative MedWand Command Center monitoring station provides a single point of monitoring for up to 1,200 patients. The Command Center allows clinicians to establish triggers to warn of excessive variance for captured vitals, and if patients are part of a daily monitoring regime, vital trend charts can be displayed. The Command Center also acts as a communications hub between supervising clinicians and in-field medical assistants or nurses. When a field worker needs to communicate with a supervising clinician, the Command Center can immediately convert an ongoing on-site exam into a full virtual consultation, complete with video conferencing and remote monitoring.As the U.S. leader in IoT with more than 100M connected devices [2], AT&amp;T helps MedWand meet the needs for robust internet-based communication for MedWand's Mobile Clinics irrespective of their location.  ""Now more than ever, connectivity is emerging as a vital technology for the healthcare industry to provide equitable care, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes,"" said Joe Drygas, AT&amp;T VP of Public Sector, Government, Education &amp; Medical Solutions. ""Our work with MedWand is another example of how our reliable and highly secure IoT connectivity is helping remove barriers that might keep someone from getting healthcare.""Providing rugged Android OS tablet and desktop computing systems that MedWand Clinics operate on, HP helps MedWand meet critical operational reliability requirements in healthcare.Hosting the MedWand VirtualCare platform, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a comprehensive set of cloud services, including Oracle Autonomous Database, with robust operational security for sensitive medical data. ""We're absolutely committed to providing cloud technologies that improve care access and drive informed decisions. With the MedWand VirtualCare platform running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we're helping to increase access to healthcare in underserved markets and to reduce the cost burden on patients,"" said Chris Gandolfo, Senior Vice President, Cloud Venture, Oracle.MedWand recently gained FDA 510(k) clearance and is now commercially available in the US and other select countries, providing internet-based clinical exams as a core component of a medical provider's healthcare solution. Transforming the capabilities of telemedicine, MedWand is available in Mobile Clinic, Ruggedized Mobile Clinic, and Desktop Clinic configurations to meet a wide range of high mobility or fixed installation requirements. By enabling real-time vitals capture and live monitoring from any location with access to the internet, MedWand provides the missing link in the delivery of high-quality healthcare, irrespective of geographical distance.When patient care depends on telemedicine, choose MedWand.

263,097327e7-2cde-3d85-856f-cda2ce6cac5c,MU,2023-01-07,Should You Invest in Micron (MU) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-micron-mu-based-bullish-143002648.html,1673015402,STORY,['MU'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.76, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.76 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MU Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 200.5% over the past month to -$1.86.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:FIS) Suggests It's 39% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-fidelity-national-information-120042499.html,1673092842,STORY,['FIS'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.09bUS$4.54bUS$4.64bUS$5.05bUS$5.31bUS$5.54bUS$5.73bUS$5.91bUS$6.07bUS$6.22bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.14%Est @ 4.19%Est @ 3.53%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.5kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.7kUS$2.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.0%) = US$86bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$86b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$35bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$67b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$69.3, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fidelity National Information Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.231. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Fidelity National Information ServicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Aon (NYSE:AON). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Aon How Fast Is Aon Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Aon's EPS has grown 31% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Aon shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 15% to 29% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Aon's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Aon Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Aon has a market capitalisation of US$62b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$711m. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.Should You Add Aon To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Aon's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Aon's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Aon (1 is a bit concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Money from the payout will be distributed to eligible claimants.A lawyer for AMTCR did not immediately respond to requests for comment.McDonald's was not a defendant. The Chicago-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In April 2021, McDonald's pledged to improve improve training to fight harassment and discrimination, after facing lawsuits claiming that female employees at corporate-owned locations were subjected to widespread sexual harassment.Eight months later, former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook returned more than $105 million of severance and issued an apology to settle the company's lawsuit claiming he lied to conceal sexual relationships with employees.The Las Vegas case is EEOC v AMTCR Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Nevada, No. 21-01808.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Hilary Russ; editing by Diane Craft)]"

Its global same-store sales increased 9.5% in the third quarter.Like other fast-food chains, McDonald's has hiked menu prices to keep up with surging commodity and labor costs.McDonald's strong sales and profits also mean that it - like several other restaurant chains including Starbucks Corp and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc - can embark on big expansion plans. McDonald's did not provide numbers for how many new stores the company wants to build.It now also plans to streamline technology - including its loyalty programs - and menu development in order to get new products into use globally more quickly.Kempczinski also promoted several executives and created a new chief transformation officer role, his letter said.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) shareholders have enjoyed a 45% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 31% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for American Express While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, American Express achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 5 years was 56%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, American Express shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 15% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  American Express is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...American Express is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

The CO2 removal credits would allow the Texans to offset the estimated carbon emissions for the team’s future air travel to regular season away games for three seasons.DAC is a technology that captures and removes large volumes of CO2 directly from the atmosphere, which can be safely and securely stored deep underground in geologic formations. For the Texan’s agreement, CO2 captured by DAC will be sequestered in saline reservoirs not associated with oil and gas production. DAC provides a practical solution for hard-to-decarbonize activities, such as air travel, to help achieve climate goals.Through the sponsorship, 1PointFive will become the Texans’ Preferred Carbon Removal Partner and work with the team to educate fans on DAC and the importance of carbon removal.“We are excited to work with the Houston Texans and for their purchase of carbon removal credits enabled by Direct Air Capture,” said Michael Avery, President and General Manager of 1PointFive. “We believe Direct Air Capture is an efficient way to help reduce an organization’s carbon footprint and provides a solution that is particularly well-suited to addressing carbon emissions associated with air travel.”“We are proud to partner with 1PointFive and welcome them to our Houston Texans family,” said Jerry Angel, Houston Texans Vice President of Corporate Development. “Together with 1PointFive, we will strive to make a difference across our community.”To learn more about 1PointFive, visit www.1PointFive.com.About 1PointFive1PointFive is a Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) platform that is working to help curb global temperature rise to 1.5°C by 2050 through the deployment of decarbonization solutions, including Carbon Engineering's Direct Air Capture (DAC) and AIR TO FUELS™ technologies alongside geologic sequestration hubs.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Caterpillar shares have been standout performers lately, handily outperforming the broader market over the past year (+10.7% vs. -19.8% for the S&amp;P 500 index). The company’s cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions has offset the impact of the supply chain snarls and cost pressures. The Zacks analyst expect that Caterpillar’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow at 29.2% and revenues are predicted to rise 13.5%.The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Equinor have gained +16.1% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry’s gain of +25.3%.

Also, the company’s board increased the extraordinary cash dividend to 70 cents per share from 50 cents per share for the third quarter of 2022.However, the company’s balance sheet has significant debt exposure as compared to the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the company is not being able to capture the potential profit growth from commodity prices that have reached record highs. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Equinor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of GSK have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (-37.1% vs. -16.4%). The company is facing generic competition for key drug, Advair is hampering sales of GSK’s respiratory products, which we believe may not be compensated by new respiratory drugs. Competitive pressure on HIV drugs has risen.According to the Zacks analyst estimates the GSK’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 3.5% over the next three years. Estimate movements have been stable ahead of Q4 results. However, GSK’s specialty products like Dovato, Nucala, Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix, Juluca are driving sales, making up for a decline in Established Pharmaceuticals due to generic erosion.The continued recovery in Shingrix sales is encouraging.

The company exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. However, escalating costs and foreign exchange headwinds do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 20.1% compared with a 19.9% fall of the industry and a 18.9% drop of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $11.87 billion. Its first-quarter 2022 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.5%.The company anticipated earnings growth rate of 6.6% for the next five years compared with the industry’s growth projection of 16.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ3 Upside: Teleflex exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. When excluding UroLift and adjusting for the Respiratory divestiture, the remaining 88% of the company’s business grew at an underlying rate of 4.3% in the third quarter. The upside continued to reflect the benefit of Teleflex's diversified portfolio, which has been purposely built to target the care of critically ill patients. Teleflex saw an improvement in revenues as the third quarter progressed, with September strengthening over July and August.Urolift Prospects Strong:  UroLift System is a minimally invasive technology for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Despite being impacted by the ongoing macro and COVID-19 headwinds, the preference for UroLift over other outpatient BPH treatments continued to be driven by strong clinical results. Several studies on Urolift have demonstrated rapid symptom relief and recovery, no new sustained sexual dysfunction and durable results.Business in Asia Holds Long-Term Potential: Observing strong demand for the company’s wide product line in emerging economies, Teleflex is focusing on expansion in densely populated geographies like Asia. The company has a solid market base for its Interventional Access and Anesthesia products in this region. During the third quarter of 2022, revenues in Asia rose 20.5% year over year on a CER basis. China had a strong performance, with growth exceeding 19%.Story continuesDownsidesEscalating Expenses Put Pressure on Bottom Line: In the third quarter, Teleflex’ gross profit was down 3.6% year over year. The gross margin contracted 93 basis points (bps) to 54.5%. Overall, the adjusted operating profit was down 16.1% year over year. Adjusted operating margin saw a 310-bp contraction year over year to 18.4%.Foreign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Teleflex due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies has been constantly hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Estimate TrendIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Teleflex’s 2022 earnings has been unchanged at $12.98.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.79 billion, suggesting a 0.6% fall from the 2021 reported number.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

ALC gains on a strong market rebound. The company’s focus on research and innovation is also encouraging. However, a challenging international market, with the subdued demand for ophthalmological products amid the pandemic, is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Alcon has outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has declined 14.8% compared with the industry’s 19.8% fall.Alcon exited the third quarter with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite macroeconomic concerns, the company reported a strong underlying third-quarter performance in its business. Its robust innovation pipeline is delivering solid results, as evident from the strength of its comprehensive portfolio of PCIOLs, including PanOptix and Vivity.Overall, the Surgical franchise continues to lead the market with its portfolio of advanced technology, intraocular lenses, a substantial installed base of equipment and a growing consumable base. Within Vision Care, ALC showed strong performance with its innovative suite of lenses, including Precision1, Dailies Total1 and Total30.In terms of end market, in Surgical, global cataract procedures were up in the high single digits in the third quarter. This growth varied significantly by region. In the United States, where surgical centers continue to be constrained by staffing shortages, the procedural volume was relatively flat. Outside the United States, procedures were up in the low teens as markets continued to improve.Alcon PriceAlcon PriceAlcon price | Alcon QuoteWithin the Vision Care end market, growth was very dynamic and varied by region. In contact lenses, market growth for the quarter was difficult to read due to the timing of price increases and inventory movements. Based on the available data, Alcon estimates that the overall lens market grew in the mid-to-high-single digits in the third quarter.Meanwhile, Alcon exited the third quarter with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The third-quarter U.S. dollar sales growth included approximately 700 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. In the quarter, within Implantables, there was a decline in advanced technology intraocular lenses sale in South Korea following a reimbursement change in the first quarter.Story continuesGiven supply-chain challenges, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, ongoing inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic headwinds, Alcon reduced its core net sales expectations and tightened its core earnings per share expectations for 2022.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

This was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $10.1 million (up 60.6%), NanoKnife sales of $5.5 million (up 49.5%) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $4.2 million (up 45.4%) compared to the prior-year quarter.This figure compares to our fiscal second quarter’s Med Tech business’ net sales projection of $23.5 million.Med Device revenues in the fiscal second quarter grossed $60.9 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago period.Story continuesThis figure compares to our fiscal second quarter’s Med Device business’ net sales projection of $60.4 million.AngioDynamics, Inc.

The long-term debt (net of current portion) at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023 was $49.8 million, flat compared with that at the end of the fiscal first quarter.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities came in at $17.2 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of $6.9 million a year ago.FY23 GuidanceAngioDynamics has reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2023.The company continues to expect its net sales in the range of $342-$348 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $342.7 million.The adjusted EPS range is projected to be between a penny and 6 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at a penny.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The company continued gaining from its Med Tech and Med Device businesses. Its year-over-year uptick in revenues and solid domestic and international revenues are impressive. Robust sales of Auryon looks encouraging. Positive physician feedback for AlphaVac products, including the F22 and F18 versions, raises optimism.During the fiscal second quarter, AngioDynamics confirmed that it had initiated a limited market release of its hydrophilic coated catheters, which provide improved steerability and deliverability. This raises optimism regarding the stock. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.However, a decline in mechanical thrombectomy revenue, which include AngioVac and AlphaVac sales, and thrombus management (when including Uni-Fuse) is concerning. AngioDynamics continues to face various macro-related headwinds, including costs associated with the continued tight labor market, raw material inflation and an increase in freight costs, which raise our apprehension.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that are supposed to report earnings soon are Boston Scientific Corporation BSX, Cardinal Health, Inc.

ECL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with its strong business, is expected to contribute further. Compliance risks and cost fluctuations persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 36.9% compared with 33.8% decline of the industry and 19.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services provider has a market capitalization of $41.25 billion. It projects 12.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain a strong performance. Ecolab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in one and matched in the other, the average earnings surprise being 0.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Portfolio Solid: We are upbeat about Ecolab’s solid product portfolio, which has enabled it to fortify its foothold in a niche space globally. Ecolab delivers comprehensive solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service to advance food safety and maintain clean and safe environments.The company also provides products and services that optimize water and energy use, and improve operational efficiencies and sustainability for customers in the food, healthcare, hospitality and industrial markets in more than 170 countries around the world.Strong Business: Ecolab’s consistent delivery of considerable earnings growth despite the current challenging business environment continues to impress. Ecolab witnessed a strong third-quarter 2022 performance, driven by continued strong sales growth, including accelerating pricing in excess of delivered product costs and further new business wins.Management confirmed that strength in the reported quarter displayed double-digit sales growth, led by a 12% uptick in total pricing and steady underlying volume trends with year-over-year comparisons reflecting strong reopening benefits last year.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Ecolab’s solid third-quarter results buoy our optimism. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top line, along with solid performances across all its segments in the quarter. Ecolab’s new business wins and innovation pipelines are well-positioned to drive growth and global leadership. The company’s digital capabilities are also continuing to broaden, develop and add competitive advantages.DownsidesCompliance Risks: Ecolab’s business is subjected to various laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards and the conduct of its business. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes the company to potential financial liability and increases its operating costs.Cost Fluctuations: The prices of raw materials used in Ecolab’s business can fluctuate from time to time. In recent years, the company has experienced periods of increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for the same, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can materially and adversely affect Ecolab’s consolidated operations.Estimate TrendEcolab is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 5.9% south to $4.47.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.67 billion, suggesting a 9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fourth-quarter revenue estimate of $3.64 billion, suggesting an 8.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Shares up nearly 2% with Wells Fargo upgrading the stock to overweight and slapping a $380 price target on the stock.Now, analyst Ike Boruchow noting that Lulu's top line resilience over the past few years has been, quote, ""nothing short of stunning."" Wells Fargo also highlighting Lulu's resilience against softness in the space, and strong full-price direct-to-consumer brand positioning as opposed to other brands which are currently navigating a shift from wholesale.Now, Wells Fargo also highlighted Nike, Burlington Stores, and Ross Stores, in its high-quality basket for its overall 2020-- 2023 outlook, Dave. And I think it's interesting when you sort of take a step back and look at what Wells Fargo is pointing out here, right? They're pointing out, well, the consumer might be trading down. But what does that mean?It might be going to a store like Ross Stores for a discount or a strong brand, when you talk about a DTC Brand like Lulu where they haven't seemed to lose anyone yet.DAVE BRIGGS: Nothing.- Because people are still buying that at full price. Or you've got to go all the way down and people are going to Ross Stores and looking for a deal. It doesn't seem like there's much in the middle.DAVE BRIGGS: It is an emotional attachment to our Lulu. And that's why we wear it to work and to the gym.- I'm rocking them right now, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll tell you what really surprised--SEANA SMITH: You guys wear them on a daily basis.DAVE BRIGGS: --me--[LAUGHTER]What really surprised me, also, in that note was a downgrade within it of Ulta. Another company that's been an absolute powerhouse through and out of the pandemic. And we thought there was no stopping them because they appear to be entirely recession-proof.But they downgrade Ulta and cut the price target from $450 to $400. Quote, ""tough set up given sales margin overshoot into the slowing macro."" So I was a little bit surprised by that because they crushed it last year, up 20%.]"

Margins are likely to end 2022 at ~16%, the analyst added.While management has clearly made strides to improve the model over the past several years, the analyst believes that in the face of a slowing topline, ULTA will see margins normalize back to their 13-14% target.Along with increased/normalized promo intensity, ULTA has guided to a shift in IT investment spend, primarily cloud integration, into 2H2023, the analyst said.The investment is part of Project SOAR announced at the company’s October FY21 analyst day, including $160-180M to be invested over the next few years to revamp the company’s supply chain, and includes projects to support the company’s expanding e-commerce focus.Story continuesAs Project SOAR ramps past its start in FY22, we’d expect the rate of investment to increase in FY23 and beyond, the analyst said.Price Action: ULTA shares are trading lower by 0.81% at $485.00 on the last check Friday.Latest Ratings for LULUDateFirmActionFromToJan 2022BarclaysMaintainsOverweightJan 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-WeightJan 2022Telsey Advisory GroupMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for LULUView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaMorgan Stanley Thinks Retailers Will Ramp Up Discounting In JanuaryDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Driven by the uptick, Delta expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating margin to be 11%, i.e. at the top of the previously guided 9-11% range.Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 7-8% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the earlier outlook was for an increase in the 5-9% range). Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have been high, in turn boosting the top line.The presence of the Thanksgiving holiday period during the fourth quarter is likely to have boosted passenger volumes. Driven by upbeat traffic, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is likely to have been very impressive in the December quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter load factor is 86%, currently, much higher than the year-ago actual reading of 78%. Our estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 load factor is currently pegged at 88.1%.However, high operating costs may have affected the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.  DAL expects adjusted earnings per share in the $1.35-$1.40 range.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Delta this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesDelta has an Earnings ESP of +5.65% (the Most Accurate Estimate is $1.34, at present, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is presently pegged at $1.27) and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3Delta's third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 42 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.51 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 per share. Escalated operating expenses induced the earnings miss. Multiple flight cancellations and booking weakness due to Hurricane Ian also hurt results.Delta reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basisOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider as well, since our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.Southwest Airlines LUV has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3. LUV will release results on Jan 26.We expect upbeat air-travel demand to have aided LUV’s fourth-quarter performance. However, high costs may have been a dampener.Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC has an Earnings ESP of +1.42% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 2.28%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 2.13%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.02%.Coming into today, shares of the largest U.S. health insurer had lost 10.58% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector gained 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.61%.UnitedHealth Group will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 13, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.17, up 15.4% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $82.79 billion, up 12.27% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.05% higher. UnitedHealth Group is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note UnitedHealth Group's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.7. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.3.Also, we should mention that UNH has a PEG ratio of 1.35. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Medical - HMOs industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.91 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Medical - HMOs industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 197, putting it in the bottom 22% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

304,d8cd1e60-0405-32e9-a76b-61e96664d438,UNH,2023-01-07,UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-unh-reports-next-150003154.html,1673017203,STORY,['UNH'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.4%.Revenues are expected to be $82.79 billion, up 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth?For UnitedHealth, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.79%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of $5.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.79, delivering a surprise of +6.24%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.UnitedHealth doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move is expected to boost Northern Light’s efficiency, cut costs and enable it to provide better service and experience to its customers throughout the state.Per the deal, around 1,400 employees of Northern Light will move to Optum this March while continuing their support of Northern Light’s operations. The move will enable Optum to take over Northern Light’s revenue cycle management and manage its information systems, inpatient care management, analytics, project management and supply-chain management.Optum, a fast-growing business of UnitedHealth, is expected to help improve the billing and scheduling experience for both clients and providers. It will also enhance Northern Light’s digital capabilities and assist it in more effectively utilizing data analytics to foresee patient and staff requirements.The deal highlights the prowess of UnitedHealth’s increasingly valuable health service business, branded Optum. UNH invests heavily to enhance Optum’s capabilities, which are paying off. From 2017 to 2021, the segment’s compounded revenues and earnings witnessed a CAGR of 14.3%.Through the latest deal, Optum is expected to help Northern Light boost its administrative efficiency and save more than $1 billion over the next 10 years, per reports.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -10.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.6% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 8.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.17 per share, indicating a change of +15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $22.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.8%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.87 indicates a change of +13% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $82.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $324.05 billion and $357.53 billion estimates indicate +12.7% and +10.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth.

So naturally many believe real estate investment trusts (REITs) that specialize in retail outlets could not possibly do well in a recessionary environment.But some Wall Street analysts are starting to look past the recessionary fears. Take a look at three retail REITs that have recently received the blessings of Wall Street analysts with action upgrades as well as higher price targets.National Retail Properties Inc. (NYSE: NNN) is a net-lease retail REIT that owns a diversified group of 3,349 properties across 48 states. National Retail Properties’ tenant roster includes stable, well-known names like 7-Eleven, Sunoco LP, Best Buy Co, Camping World Holdings, BJ's Wholesale Cluband Chuck E. Cheese.On its company website, National Retail Properties says it has produced 33 consecutive annual dividend increases. The current annual dividend is $2.20, and yields 4.7%. Forward funds from operations (FFO) of $3.13 cover the dividend with a 70% payout ratio.In its third-quarter operating results, National Retail Properties stated its properties are 99.4% occupied with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years. These are excellent numbers and should bode well for investors, even if 2023 brings about a hard recession.On Jan. 3, Jefferies analyst Linda Tsai upgraded National Retail Properties from Hold to Buy and increased its price target from $43 to $52. This represents a potential 13% upside from its most recent closing price of $46.02.Latest Offerings on Benzinga’s Real Estate Investment Screener10 Federal Self-Storage 4 - Self-Storage Real Estate Fund With 14%-16% Target IRRMercantile Industrial Park - Fully-Leased Light Industrial Portfolio With 17% Target IRRThe Chloe Residences - Multifamily Property In Austin, TX, With 17.4%-19.4% Target IRRStory continuesRegency Centers Corp.

It’s interesting that analysts are upgrading certain REITs that have struggled over the past year, perhaps believing that while the worst may not be over, the current share prices have already discounted the potential recessionary headwinds of 2023.Check Out More on Real Estate from BenzingaBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100This Fund Is Looking To Produce Moderate Returns If The Real Estate Market Doesn't Collapse – And Spectacular Returns If It DoesThis Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed.

That's why when we briefly looked at Estée Lauder Companies' (NYSE:EL) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business.

Growing focus on marketing campaigns and prudent product launches are contributing to the growth of players in the space. These investments, inflationary pressures and supply-chain disruptions come at the cost of margins.Nevertheless, rising consumer focus towards grooming and personal appearance along with the abovementioned upsides have been working for players like The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. EL, Coty Inc. COTY, Inter Parfums, Inc. IPAR and Helen of Troy Limited HELE.About the IndustryThe Zacks Cosmetics industry includes companies providing beauty and personal care products. Players in the industry manufacture, distribute, sell and market skincare, fragrance, makeup and hair care products. Many firms in the space market via sales representatives, whereas some sell products through retailers, independent and chain drug stores and pharmacies, upscale perfumeries, department stores and beauty salons. The companies also operate through retailer websites, third-party distributors and in-flight and duty-free shops. Some of the products offered by the industry participants include moisturizers, serums, toners and cleansers under skincare; perfume sprays, candles and soaps under fragrance; lipsticks, mascaras, powders, eye shadows, foundation and nail polishes under makeup; and shampoos, conditioner and hair color products under hair care.Trends Shaping the Future of the Cosmetics IndustryStrong Demand for Skincare, Revival in Makeup: Burgeoning demand for skincare and other personal care products is working well for several cosmetic companies. Consumers’ increased focus on self-care and maintaining healthy skincare routines works well for this category. The makeup category is on track to full recovery for cosmetic players. This can be attributed to the rising demand for beauty products amid more socialization. Players in the space have seen strength in the fragrance and haircare category, with product newness being a solid driver. Such upsides are likely to continue supporting the top-line performance of cosmetics companies. In addition, increased consumer spending on cosmetic products during the holiday season is a tailwind for these companies.Innovation &amp; Digitization – Major Drivers: Talking of beauty and skincare, consumers keep expecting unique product offerings incorporating the latest technologies and expert scientific formulations. Focus on resonating with consumers’ evolving preferences has kept cosmetic players busy in terms of innovation and product launches. Increased consumer awareness has also stimulated demand for organic skincare and “clean beauty” products. Further, Cosmetic players’ foremost priority has been to broaden their market reach by boosting e-commerce capabilities. Thanks to the ease and convenience of online shopping, cosmetics sales via online channels are increasing consistently. Cosmetic companies are making significant progress on this front, evident from tools like virtual try, new digital payment solutions and digital marketing efforts. Other than this, players have been fueling brand portfolios through prudent buyouts and strategic alliances.Inflationary Headwinds: Companies in the cosmetics space are encountering inflationary pressure on operating costs like labor, supplies and travel. Several players are battling supply-chain disruptions stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity, resulting in increased freight costs. In addition, elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to have pushed SG&amp;A costs upward for cosmetic companies. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins. The impact of lower demand due to inflationary pressure and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Cosmetics industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it in the top 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results in a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of December 2022, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current financial year has increased 11.4%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Vs.

311,02d92ca5-f494-3d61-aa8e-fba24ab69555,ADP,2023-01-07,Do Automatic Data Processing's (NASDAQ:ADP) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/automatic-data-processings-nasdaq-adp-130054771.html,1673096454,STORY,['ADP'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Automatic Data Processing's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Automatic Data Processing has grown EPS by 10% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Our analysis has highlighted that Automatic Data Processing's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for Automatic Data Processing remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.9% to US$17b. That's encouraging news for the company!Story continuesYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.Are Automatic Data Processing Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Automatic Data Processing has a market capitalisation of US$100b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$120m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Automatic Data Processing, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.The Automatic Data Processing CEO received US$6.9m in compensation for the year ending June 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Does Automatic Data Processing Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Automatic Data Processing is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Automatic Data Processing, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Automatic Data Processing , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

312,f55791ab-fa53-3001-961f-ced6f4509171,PG,2023-01-07,2 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy and Never Sell,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-dividend-aristocrat-stocks-buy-221110605.html,1673043070,STORY,"['PG', 'CAH']","[A dividend aristocrat is a stock that is a member of the S&amp;P500 that has raised dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. This filter alone is an effective way to identify companies with lasting brands, durable cash flow, and effective management.They make products or provide services you use every day without even thinking about it and their returns are the opposite of high-flying speculative technology stocks. Dividend Aristocrats are steady and maybe a bit boring. But that can be a good thing, especially during periods of volatility.2022 was a big year for dividend stocks and the NOBL ETF, which is a fund holding the 64 dividend aristocrats outperformed the broad market.Some of the best performing stocks of 2022 were among these dividend growth companies, which presents us with a slight problem. I want to invest in some of these companies, but many were bid up significantly in 2022 amid a flight to safety. My goal is to find companies that are on this list, but are also reasonably valued, score well on the Zacks Rank, and will do well if the economy goes into a recession.TradingviewImage Source: TradingviewProcter and Gamble (PG)Procter and Gamble is a consumer staples company with a broad portfolio of brands including Gillette razors, Bounty paper towels, Pampers diapers, and Tide laundry detergent to name just a few. Procter and Gamble has a total of 65 brands that cover many daily necessities, which is one reason why we are looking at PG.Even in the case of a recession, these everyday products will likely be some of the very last things families remove from their budgets, if they cut them at all.PG is a 185-year-old company that has raised its dividend for 66 consecutive years. In 2022 Procter and Gamble did $80 billion in revenue, $21 billion in EBITDA, and currently has a dividend yield of 2.4%. The stock trades with a P/E ratio of 26x. While this is a lofty valuation compared to the sector, it is just above Procter and Gamble’s long-term median P/E of 23x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research2022 was a rather challenging year for PG stock. Along with the broad market, the stock price experienced a major correction, down 26% at the worst point. Procter and Gamble eventually made a strong recovery, finishing the year down marginally. Fortunately for us, I believe this correction shook many weak holders. Even more compelling is the technical setup as is seen in the nearby chart. Over the last month a clear bull flag has formed, and a breakout above $155 should push the stock towards its all-time high. Trading below $150 invalidates this trade setup.TradingviewImage Source: Tradingview Lastly, PG sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), illustrating that its earnings outlook has improved, which is no easy task at the moment. Something else to note is that 2023 Year over Year estimates for sales growth is estimated at -0.78%, while earnings growth for the same period is +0.34%. This is no simple feat for a business but is typical for these dividend growth companies. This is possible only because brands like PG can raise prices of their products without affecting demand. This is a huge testament to their resilience as a company.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health is probably one of those companies you’ve never heard of but has a big impact on your life. CAH specializes in the distribution of healthcare products and serves over 100,000 locations including more than 75% of hospitals in the US. Cardinal Health is also one of the highest revenue generating companies in the US with $180 billion in sales in 2022.In the case of a recession, it is unlikely that CAH will suffer in a significant way. Healthcare expenses are inelastic, and Cardinal Health is a major piece of infrastructure for the healthcare industry. Whether people have disposable income or not should not affect Cardinal Health’s business model.CAH earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) given its upward earnings revisions and does very well in the Style Scores as well, earning an A in Value and Momentum, and a B for Growth. Fundamentally, I believe Cardinal Health is very fairly valued as well. Looking at the Price to Free Cash Flow ratio, CAH trades at just a 7.5x multiple, below its long-term median of 11x. For a mature business like this Price to FCF multiple under 10x is very appealing.Cardinal Health also sports a 2.6% dividend yield, which it has increased for the last 35 consecutive years.ConclusionDividend income investing is not nearly as sexy as technology investing, or venture capital, but the results speak for themselves. While 2022 was especially good for these types of companies you can go much further back to see that this is not an anomaly. Focusing on businesses that have been around for a long time, are conservative with their financials, and regularly return cash to shareholders is a winning strategy in the long run. With consistent cash flow, and entrenched brands it is hard to go wrong adding dividend growth stocks to a well-diversified portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year as inflation remained stuck at its 40-year high level. The pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system amid strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli and aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed resulted in almost day-to-day fluctuations.Dow Suffers the Least in 2022Last year, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year and 10.3% from its record high. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 19.4% year over year and more than 20% from its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite plummeted 33.1% year over year and 32.9% from its all-time high.The primary concern of the U.S. economy was soaring inflation which is currently at its 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, in 2022, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25%, which took the range of the Fed fund rate to 4.25-4.5%.The Fed terminated the quantitative easing program of buying $120 billion of bonds per month in March and reduced the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet by $364 billion. Consequently, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note reached as high as 4.33% once a time.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks, especially the technology  players. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index has suffered the least.Dow Likely to Repeat Performance in 2023The central bank projected in December that the terminal rate would top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes. This is higher than the September forecast of 4.75%. No rate cut is expected before 2024.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would pursue aggressive interest rate hikes and tighter momentary control policies until inflation comes down to at least near its 2% target level. A marginal decline in the inflation rate has no meaningful implication for the Fed.Story continuesMarket participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward.As a result, growth and momentum stocks are likely to underperform in 2023 and cyclical value stocks will take centerstage. Consequently, the Dow is likely to outperforms its peers in 2023 too.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks. These stocks have solid potential for 2023 as well as for the long-term (3 to 5 years). Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in 2022. It was the benchmark’s worst performance in more than a decade and ended a three-year winning streak.With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continued to drag on.Even now, the picture is quite mixed. While the Fed’s scaled-back rate hike of 50 basis points, following four back-to-back increases of 75 basis points each, provided a much-needed respite to the economy, softness in consumer spending, worries over a tight labor market and the lowering of this year’s GDP to 0.5% from the previous estimate of 1.2%, played spoilsport.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are the three stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines Group AAL: The largest airline internationally, American Airlines’ primary business is to provide passenger and cargo services. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Fort Worth, TX-based carrier indicates 97.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth.

327,9ce886a4-d1dd-3acc-9e36-335f36677fa6,ETN,2023-01-07,Eaton Corporation plc's (NYSE:ETN) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-corporation-plcs-nyse-etn-140035688.html,1673013635,STORY,['ETN'],"[Eaton's (NYSE:ETN) stock is up by a considerable 15% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Eaton's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Eaton is:14% = US$2.3b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Eaton's Earnings Growth And 14% ROEAt first glance, Eaton seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. For this reason, Eaton's five year net income decline of 8.3% raises the question as to why the decent ROE didn't translate into growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Eaton's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Eaton fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Eaton Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Eaton has a high three-year median payout ratio of 57% (that is, it is retaining 43% of its profits). This suggests that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This goes some way in explaining why its earnings have been shrinking. With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for Eaton.Moreover, Eaton has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 43% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 19% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Eaton has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Aflac's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Aflac How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aflac is:21% = US$5.1b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Aflac's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Aflac seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Yet, Aflac has posted measly growth of 4.9% over the past five years. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared Aflac's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 13% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AFL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Aflac Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?A low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (implying that the company retains the remaining 79% of its income) suggests that Aflac is retaining most of its profits. This should be reflected in its earnings growth number, but that's not the case. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Aflac has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 32% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 12% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Aflac certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

The sewer collection system serves 250 properties.The aging of crucial water and wastewater infrastructure is concerning for the water industry of the United States. After completing the acquisition, Pennsylvania American Water plans to invest $1.3 million in the first five years of ownership to improve the overall wastewater infrastructure of the acquired assets. The acquisition of wastewater assets will extend American Water Works’ high-quality services to its new customers.Fragmented Industry Needs ConsolidationAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers at present. Due to a large number of small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, at times, essential upgrades and repairs of infrastructure get delayed.Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the losses of water utility operators. Aging and a lack of timely maintenance are major contributors to pipeline breaks.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for the upgrade of infrastructure and the continuation of high-quality services to customers. American Water Works continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Utilities Continue to ConsolidateOther water utilities like California Water Service Group CWT, SJW Group SJW and Essential Utilities WTRG in the water utility space are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.California Water Service recently received approval to acquire the water system assets of Skylonda Mutual Water Company. The buyout is scheduled to close later this year, subject to customary closing conditions. Also, in June 2022, CWT announced that its unit, Texas Water Service, closed the acquisition of Railyard Utility’s wastewater system by collaborating with BVRT Utility Holding Company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for California Water Service's 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 21.7%. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.63%.SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first nine months of 2022, WTRG completed two acquisitions, which added 19,175 customers. Essential Utilities plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Essential Utilities’ long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.2%. The current dividend yield of the company is 2.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 6.5%, respectively.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of AWK have gained 21.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 16.1% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Federal Reserve is not done raising interest rates, and there is a consensus that the terminal rate could reach 5%. Thus, a lot of volatility and a possible recession still lie ahead. That being said, it’s essential to include dividend stocks in your portfolio. There are many dividend stocks, but some are exceptionally resistant to recessionary pressures.Thus, I have picked companies with inelastic and relevant businesses with historical and fundamental resilience to a future recession. The following seven dividend stocks will maintain dividends and generate passive income even during harsh economic conditions.CLColgate-Palmolive$78.52NDSNNordson Corp.$237.36FLOFlowers Foods$28.50VZVerizon$39.90SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$75.32JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$177.30PEPPepsiCo$178.49Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is among the most stable long-term dividend stocks to buy. The company’s stability is remarkable as the demand for consumer staples is highly inelastic, especially if it’s for essential products such as toothpaste. Of course, the stock offers little upside due to its entrenched business. But Colgate-Palmolive’s long-term stability will keep it trading at a premium for a long time and help it maintain a healthy dividend yield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs for financials, its profits have slightly declined by 2.5% in Q3 of last year. However, once margin compression stops and the supply setbacks are fully resolved, I expect profits to grow along with the top line. The company has 60 years of consecutive increases in dividends and has a forward dividend yield of 2.39%.Nordson Corp. (NDSN)An image of US currencySource: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comNordson Corp. (NASDAQ:NDSN) is a leading global manufacturer of precision dispensing equipment, fluid management systems, and related technologies. The company has a diversified portfolio of products and services that cater to a wide range of industries, including packaging, electronics, medical, and automotive. Nordson has been in business since 1954, and since then, it has grown to become a major global player in its field.Story continuesThe company is well-known for its strong financial performance and robust balance sheet. Nordson’s margins are especially impressive, with a net margin of 19.81%, better than 92.49% of 2768 companies in the industrial products industry.Conversely, the company’s dividend yield of 1.09% is less robust, but it has consistently increased over the years. However, this is substituted by the company’s stock performance. NDSN stock is up nearly 60% in the past five years and is only down 5.3% in the past 365 days. Thus, the company offers dividends in addition to its robust performance, making it more appealing.Flowers Foods (FLO)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comIf you are looking for dividend stocks to buy with a perfect balance of short-term risk, long-term gains, and robust financials, Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) should be your top pick. The cons of this stock are almost negligible, which is why I routinely include this market idea in my articles.First, FLO stock is up 51%-plus in the last five years. Zoom out further, and you can see that the stock has been almost on an unbroken long-term uptrend for the last twenty-two years. Holders of this stock are essentially matching the S&amp;P500’s gain while risking minimal long-term downside, as it has gained 4.62% in the past year. Even better, Flowers Foods has a dividend yield of 3.06%.Second, the company’s financials are highly consistent. The company’s top line is growing at a two-digit clip and accelerating in this environment, while its profits grew 5.13% despite margins declining. With that in mind, FLO is undoubtedly among the top dividend stocks to buy for 2023.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is generally seen as an underperformer with little upside. However, last year’s selloff has turned VZ into a value stock that investors should start taking seriously. Sure, its profits are down by nearly a quarter. But it should be noted that the company has a well-established business that will remain relevant for years. Furthermore, its top line continues to grow while the company expands into new communications technology segments, such as broadband. The government is keen to develop and broaden internet infrastructure across the U.S., and Verizon is set to benefit from that ambition.Simply put, a company with Verizon’s growth prospects and prominence merit a much higher valuation. I believe its current trough is an excellent buy opportunity and could pay off massively in the long run. Verizon’s forward dividend yield of 6.62% and 18 years of consecutive dividend increases are just icing on the cake.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a Fortune 500 American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and a provider of security products. Its stock is near a decade low after the selloff last year, and it seems set to u-turn this year.Its financials are turning a corner after both its top, and bottom lines outperformed expectations. Revenue grew 9% in Q3 2022, while profits grew 104%. Margins have also recovered sharply, and SWK stock is bottoming out after a 67% decline from its peak and is now changing hands at 8.24 times earnings.Additionally, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has a dividend yield of 4.26% with 55 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, SWK stock looks highly oversold and should be among the top market ideas for your dividend stocks to buy list.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Why Johnson &amp; Johnson Stock is Clearly Set to Rise AgainSource: ShutterstockIf you are looking for safer stocks similar to FLO and CL, consider Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). It is a household name that I don’t need to discuss much further except that the company has a remarkably well-established business with highly profitable inelastic segments. The company’s top line is slowing down but remains robust while its profits have picked up again. It also has a healthy dividend yield of 2.56% and a notable net margin of 20%, ranked better than 88.45% of 1056 companies in the drug manufacturing industry.All things considered, Johnson &amp; Johnson is among the safest dividend stocks to buy. The company’s robust profits and stability will allow it to pay dividends while growing for the foreseeable future.PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the safest and least volatile among the seven dividend stocks to buy for 2023. It is also dividend king with 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, which makes it even more appealing. The company has a long history of weathering economic storms that will continue to give PEP a substantial edge among other safe stocks. Its business is highly diversified into inelastic segments, and its products will remain relevant for decades.Furthermore, PepsiCo’s dividend yield of 2.55%, combined with its impressive net margin of 11.61%, ranked better than 81.65% of 109 companies in the non-alcoholic beverages industry, making it an attractive option for investors looking for value and long-term capital appreciation. The company’s 3-year revenue growth rate also sits at a healthy 8% clip, in the top 25% in its industry.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While companies will collaborate on the discovery and pre-clinical development, Moderna will lead the clinical development and commercialization of therapeutics resulting from the agreement.Per the terms of the agreement, CytomX will receive an upfront payment of $35 million (including $5 million as prepaid research funding) from Moderna. CytomX will also be eligible to receive up to $1.2 billion in milestone payments. In addition, CytomX will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on the future sales of therapies developed under this agreement.The agreement also provides Moderna an option to participate in future equity financing by CytomX.Shares of CytomX have declined 56.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 16.6% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike Moderna, CytomX also entered into a strategic collaboration with Regeneron REGN last November to develop next-generation bispecific immunotherapies. This collaboration intends to combine Regeneron and CytomX’s proprietary platforms to develop therapies for treating cancer. Per the terms, Regeneron will lead the development and commercialization of the candidates developed under this agreement. In return, Regeneron paid $30 million upfront payment to CytomX. In addition, CytomX will also be eligible to receive up to $2 billion in potential milestone payments and tiered royalties on the future sales of therapies developed under this agreement.Apart from the above collaborations, CytomX has also entered into partnerships with large-cap pharma companies like AbbVie ABBV, Amgen and Bristol Myers and is developing pipeline candidates along with these companies, which have been designed to target multiple oncology indications.Story continuesIn a separate press release, CytomX also announced business updates for 2023. The company intends to file separate investigational new drug (IND) applications for two new wholly owned programs, CX-2051 and CX-801, which will target cancer indications. CTMX also aims to broaden its pipeline in the field of T-cell-engaging bi-specifics.CytomX also announced a pipeline update from the completed phase II cohort expansion study. This study evaluated CX-2029, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) candidate, which is being developed in partnership with AbbVie. Data from this study showed that the AbbVie-partnered candidate continued to demonstrate encouraging anti-cancer activity in heavily pre-treated patients with squamous tumors. AbbVie and CytomX intend to determine the next steps for the candidate later this year.CytomX Therapeutics, Inc. Price CytomX Therapeutics, Inc.
