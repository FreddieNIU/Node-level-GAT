U.S. fixed income led the way with $3.3 billion in outflows, closely followed by $2.3 billion in U.S. equity ETFs, per etf.com. However, International equity ETFs and international fixed-income ETFs saw inflows of $790.3 million and $503.4 million, respectively.As such, Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund FXO, Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF SCHD dominated the top creation list last week.The lackluster performance came as U.S. stocks logged in the steepest losses since mid-December last week. The S&amp;P dipped 1.1%, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.4%. A round of weak quarterly earnings reports and concerns about the Fed’s plan to continue increasing interest rates took a toll on investors’ sentiment.Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields continued their climb and the yield curve has inverted (in which short rates are higher than longer rates) sharply since early 1980s, triggering fresh worries about economic troubles. Notably, inversions tend to precede a recession (read: Invest in These ETF Zones to Keep Your Money Safe).Further, the earnings picture so far appears to be weak and points to a recession. Earnings from the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far are down 6.7% from the same period last year on 5.7% higher revenues, with 71.0% beating EPS estimates and 69.0% beating revenue estimates. The growth pace for both earnings and revenues represents a notable deceleration from the trend seen in other recent periods.We have given details of the ETFs below:Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)Invesco QQQ topped asset flow creation last week, gathering $908.1 million in capital.

However, mixed quarterly results from well-known players slowed down the rally in the sector lately (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks &amp; ETFs?).While Intel INTC and Qualcomm QCOM disappointed investors, Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research Corporation LRCX and Advanced Micro Devices AMD came up with solid earnings reports. As such, semiconductor ETFs remained strong over the past month with VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF PSI and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL rising 12.8%, 12.7%, 12.4%, 10.4% and 8.7%, respectively.Let’s dig into the individual performances:Semiconductor Earnings in FocusIntel, the world’s largest chipmaker, missed estimates for both earnings and revenues and offered a weak outlook for 2023, citing cooling demand for its chips used in personal computers. Earnings of 10 cents per share came much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and revenues of $14 billion also came in below the estimated $14.5 billion. Intel projects another big revenue decline for the current quarter, along with deeper-than-expected losses. Revenues are expected in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, while loss will likely be about 15 cents per share (read: Intel Plunges on Earnings Miss, Weak Guidance: ETFs in Focus).Texas Instruments reported solid Q4 results topping our earnings estimate by 17 cents and revenue estimate by $84 million. For first-quarter 2023, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.17-$4.53 billion and earnings per share of $1.64-$1.90.Lam Research also topped on both revenue and earnings for second-quarter fiscal 2023. Earnings per share of $10.71 strongly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 76 cents, while revenues of $5.28 billion edged past the estimated $5.08 billion. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues of $3.8 billion (+/- $300 million) and earnings per share of $6.50 (+/- 75 cents).Advanced Micro Devices beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings by three cents and on revenues by $58 million. It expects first-quarter 2023 revenues of $5.3 billion (+/-$300 million), which indicates a year-over-year decline of 10%.At Qualcomm, earnings per share of $2.37 for first-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents, while revenues of $9.46 billion fell short of the estimate of $9.56 billion.

4,21f933dd-dd48-3ca6-b769-91a86864bce9,NUE,2023-02-15,Should You Be Adding Nucor (NYSE:NUE) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-nucor-nyse-nue-watchlist-110103935.html,1676458863,STORY,['NUE'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Nucor (NYSE:NUE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Nucor with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor's Improving ProfitsNucor has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Nucor's EPS shot up from US$23.23 to US$30.07; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a fantastic gain of 29%.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Nucor maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$42b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Nucor.Story continuesAre Nucor Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Nucor has a market capitalisation of US$43b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$288m. This comes in at 0.7% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Nucor Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Nucor has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

It may not have been easy to hold on to NUE for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Nucor's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nucor's main business drivers.Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Nucor Corporation is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck and cold finished bars in the United States. It also produces direct reduced iron (“DRI”) that is used in its steel mills. The company has 123 operating facilities, primarily in the United States and Canada. Also, most of its operating facilities and customers are located in North America.Over the years, the company has grown through acquisitions as well as by tapping new markets and expanding geographically. Through its network of “mini-mills”, the company produces steel sheets, bars, plates as well as various structural and other products. Nucor, in 2014, completed the acquisition of Gallatin Steel Company from global steel giant ArcelorMittal and Brazilian steel maker Gerdau for roughly $770 million in cash. Notably, the company is North America’s largest recycler, which uses scrap steel as the primary raw material in producing steel and steel products.Nucor operates in three segments – the Steel Mills segment (23.2 million shipments in 2022), the Steel Products segment and the Raw Materials segment. The Steel Mills segment manufactures hot rolled steel products such as angles, rounds, flats, channels, rebar, sheets, wide-flange beams, pilings, billets, blooms, beam blanks, and plates; and cold-rolled steel products. The Steel Products segment makes steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems and light gauge steel framing among other products. The Raw Materials segment produces direct reduced iron, ferrous and nonferrous metals, and pig iron; ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap from the facility in Trinidad.  Story continuesNucor sells its hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel to steel service centers, fabricators, and manufacturers; steel joists and joist girders, and steel deck to general contractors and fabricators; and cold finished steel and steel fasteners to distributors and manufacturers. Its steel products are used in highways, bridges, reservoirs, utilities, hospitals, schools, airports, stadiums and high-rise buildings.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Nucor a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2013 would be worth $3,530.86, or a 253.09% gain, as of February 14, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 172.13% and the price of gold increased 8.92% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for NUE.Nucor’s earnings and sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is committed to expand its production capabilities and grow its business through strategic acquisitions. Its efforts to boost production capacity through a number of growth projects should drive profitability. Nucor is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market, which is driving its steel products segment. It is also witnessing strong demand in the heavy equipment market. Demand in the automotive market is also expected to improve this year as the semiconductor crisis gradually eases and automakers ramp up production. The company also remains focused on achieving greater penetration in automotive. Nucor has also outperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year.The stock has jumped 6.38% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more most profitable bank stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In.Many big banks did not do well during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Given home values decreased substantially in 2008, some financial institutions that made riskier loans lost a lot of money. Considering the economy slowed substantially in 2008, even more financial institutions lost a lot of money as well. With the slowing economy, leading investment bank Lehman Brothers eventually went bankrupt, and the government had to eventually bail out some of the big banks.As a result of the financial crisis, some big banks were labeled as systemically important, meaning their failure could lead to instability in the financial system.Although shareholders of systematically important institutions could still lose all their money if the institution failed, the government placed more regulation on those systemically important institutions and as a result, many of the big banks had to have more capital than before that weighed on their profitability.Nevertheless, big banks have done well over the last ten years given the growing U.S. economy even though there has been some dips due to market declines or the pandemic. Many U.S. banks have also benefited from higher interest rates. Many banks find it easier to make more in net interest margin when interest rates are a little higher than when they are near zero.Although interest rates have risen substantially in 2022, many big bank stocks did not do well, however.One reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also led to a considerable increase in U.S. Treasury yields. As a result of substantially higher Treasury yields, a lot of capital moved from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and many leading equity stock valuations decreased as a result.Another reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also increased the chance of a recession. If there is a recession, bank loan losses could increase and this could lead to lower than expected profits or even losses that might send their stocks lower.Story continuesWhile inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year, many expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. If it raises rates too much further, the odds of a recession or an economic slowdown that might send bank stocks lower will increase.Given some companies might underperform or the economy could worsen, leading bank stocks might not achieve their potential. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.kmichal/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In, we took the 10 largest banks by market capitalization in the United States and ranked them based on the amount of TTM net income they had according to YCharts.Because we used YCharts data, the net income data might not be adjusted earnings.10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In10.

(NYSE: CF) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with bp (NYSE: BP) for the supply of 2.2 billion cubic feet (BCF) of certified natural gas in 2023.MiQ-certified natural gas, or certified gas, is produced by companies whose operations are independently verified by a third-party auditor. These third parties provide a factual assessment of methane emissions intensity – the ratio of methane emissions to natural gas produced. CF Industries uses natural gas as a feedstock in the production of ammonia. Methane emissions throughout the natural gas supply chain are a significant contributor to the lifecycle carbon intensity of ammonia production and one of the two largest sources of scope 3 emissions for the Company.The natural gas is certified using not-for-profit MiQ’s methane standard, which leverages independent third-party auditors to monitor, address, and grade the natural gas used in ammonia production. The Company will use the highest level of certified gas available, or ‘A’ grade, which – when compared to industry production averages (GREET, 2022) – lowers the methane emissions associated with the natural gas purchased by around 90%. This is the first known purchase of certified gas by an industrial company for use in its ammonia production processes.""This initial purchase of certified natural gas is an important step in CF Industries’ decarbonization journey and reinforces our commitment to be at the forefront of low-carbon ammonia production,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""The independent, transparent and third party-audited process to validate lower methane emissions intensity ensures that we are genuinely achieving scope 3 emissions reductions from purchasing certified natural gas. At the same time, we believe the resulting lower lifecycle carbon intensity of ammonia production will further enhance the appeal of decarbonized ammonia as a clean energy source for hard-to-abate industries.""Story continuesA recent white paper published by MiQ estimates that using ‘A’ grade certified natural gas as a feedstock in ammonia production would lower a purchaser’s natural gas supply chain-related scope 3 emissions by 90% and reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity by up to 20% using a 100yr global warming potential (GWP). The use of certified natural gas alongside carbon capture and sequestration processes at ammonia plants could eliminate up to 94% of greenhouse gas emissions associated with ammonia production, according to MIQ.""CF Industries is the first industrial giant to use MiQ-independently certified natural gas to significantly reduce scope 3 emissions from its production processes,"" said Georges Tijbosch, CEO, MiQ. ""We’ve seen multiple utilities across in the U.S. purchase independently certified gas to reduce their emissions, and this key commitment by CF Industries should be a trigger for other natural gas users in hard to abate industries to prioritize the minimization of their supply chain emissions through certification.""The purchase agreement will allow CF industries to confirm its systems can track the certified natural gas through the ammonia production process.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CF, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.33% heading into earnings season.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

WMT is likely to register a top-line increase from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Feb 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $158.9 billion, suggesting growth of about 4% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has risen by a penny in the past 30 days to $1.51 per share. However, this indicates a drop of 1.3% from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter.The omnichannel retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average. WMT delivered an earnings surprise of 13.6% in the last reported quarter.Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWalmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWalmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc. QuoteCost and Profit PictureLike other industry participants, Walmart is encountering cost inflation and expects it to remain elevated. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart’s consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 89 basis points (bps), primarily due to markdowns and a sales mix in the U.S. segment, a LIFO charge at Sam’s Club related to inflation and the timing of Flipkart’s annual event.The gross margin at Walmart U.S. fell 77 bps due to increased general merchandise markdowns and a mix shift toward grocery, somewhat offset by pricing. The persistence of any of these factors remains a concern.For the fourth quarter, consolidated operating income growth is expected between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are likely to have declined 3-5% in the fourth quarter.Management’s fiscal 2023 guidance for consolidated operating income and EPS views suggest a decline from the year-ago period’s reported figures. Management expects the consolidated adjusted operating income to have declined 6.5-7.5%. Excluding divestitures, management expects a consolidated adjusted operating income decline of 5.5-6.5%. Fiscal 2023 EPS is expected to have decreased 6-7%, and 5-6% excluding divestitures.Story continuesFavorable TrendsWMT has been gaining from its sturdy comp sales record, which is driven by its constant store expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce initiatives. Walmart has been benefiting from the growing e-commerce business and omnichannel penetration.The company has been undertaking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved delivery and payment systems. Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has been a major contributor to e-commerce sales.The company is innovating in the supply chain, adding capacity and building businesses, such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+, Spark Delivery, Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. WMT has been strengthening its delivery arm, as evident from its expansion of the InHome delivery service, investments in DroneUp, a pilot with HomeValet, the introduction of Carrier Pickup by FedEx, the launch of the Walmart+ membership program and the introduction of Express Delivery, among others.As of the third quarter, Walmart U.S. had 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900 same-day delivery stores. The company’s compelling pricing strategy has also been aiding amid a rising inflationary environment. Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 5.5% for fiscal 2023. These factors bode well for the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Walmart this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Walmart has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.47%.

Dunton declined to say how many employees will be affected.The company said in a prepared statement that it hopes to relocate or allow remote-work for employees affected by the closures.Dunton described the move as a “location strategy” and said decisions on where to move will be managed individually. Before the closures, the company operated 17 tech hubs worldwide — six of which were based abroad, according to its website.Walmart is also cutting back on remote work and asking its tech teams to plan regular in-office work days. Dunton declined to say how many days tech staff will be required to be in the office. Other corporate staffers were asked to return to the office in late 2021.“Our decision to be together more frequently anchors to Walmart’s fundamental belief that our people make the difference, our culture matters and we build stronger partnerships when we are physically together,” the company said.Walmart is the largest employer in the country, with nearly 1.6 million workers in the U.S. Its technology teams employ 20,000 and grew rapidly during the pandemic.In March of last year, the company, which is based in Bentonville, Arkansas, announced it would hire 5,000 more tech workers and add hubs in Atlanta and Toronto. It laid off 200 corporate staff in the summer after warning consumers had pulled back on discretionary purchases amid high inflation. Dunton said the cuts related to organizational changes.The company said last month it would raise its hourly wages from $12 to $14, a move that will help it attract more front-line workers in a still-tight labor market.]"

I'm not merely rocking red shoes because it's Valentine's Day. No, it's because the retailer, Under Armour, today opened a pop-up store on Fifth Ave in New York City centered around these babies. This is Under Armour's new $150 sneaker/slip. So what's the key here? The key is how the heel folds down. If you can see, the heel folds up, and then folds right back down, and it becomes a slide after you're done working out. Yeah, it is both a slide and a shoe.Founder Kevin Plank saying at a launch party last night, we have not yet built our defining product, but this comes close. The sneakers also offer the BOA wheel tightening cable system that eliminates the need to tie laces. That appeals to the young kids. New CEO Stephanie Linnartz will start in less than two weeks after 25 years at Marriott. She'll have her hands full.Shares are up 6% this year, down 37% over the last 12 months and really flat today. I got to tell you, I put them on initially and was bothered by folding the heel down. But I wore them all day and forgot it was there. And so now it has become a really convenient-- they're not aiming at 46-year-old dads. I think they're aiming at my teenage kids, who I think this will really appeal.SEANA SMITH: That's what I was just going to say. I don't know if you're exactly the target demo.DAVE BRIGGS: No.SEANA SMITH: You were very-- I was next to you. You were very, very skeptical when you first put it on. I think it makes a lot of sense, especially if you are targeting those teenagers. You remember-- I remember when I was much younger, I would try to fit my foot into shoes all the time without having to reach down because I was simply lazy. So it makes a lot of sense. I think this could potentially be a hit for teens and for those in their early 20s. I don't know about that red color. I love it for Valentine's Day.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, it's Valentine's Day, man.SEANA SMITH: I know. I like that you're rocking the red there, but I don't know. It's certainly not the next it product.DAVE BRIGGS: They've got white, yellow, black, and a pink version--SEANA SMITH: I would try it. What about you?DAVE BRIGGS: --as well.ALLIE CANAL: I think teens, yes, I agree. One, if you're working out in that and then sliding it in, doesn't the shoe get smelly?

You know, I could see--DAVE BRIGGS: But yes, they do get smelly.ALLIE CANAL: Yes, I was going to say, because I know my sneakers, I have very specific sneakers for each thing that I do.

Also, boding well for the long-term outlook of NOW stock, on Dec. 24, Morgan Stanley named NOW as its top pick in the software sector, explaining that “The nature of the company’s subscription model gives us confidence in the durability of growth.” The bank also indicated that NOW’s focus on large customers makes it a stable, low-risk choice.Indeed last quarter the firm added a net total of  126 new customers whose annual contract value was $1 million or high, showing the company’s ability to attract many large customers. And the fact that ServiceNow’s subscription renewal rate came in at 98% last quarter shows that almost all of its customers are satisfied with its offerings. Of course, the latter metric bodes very well for the long-term outlook of NOW stock.Illumina (ILMN)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIllumina’s (NASDAQ:ILMN) products, which carry out DNA sequencing, enable scientists and healthcare professionals to analyze the composition of DNA,. As a result, they can create or utilize more effective, targeted treatments for patients.For example, in January 2022, Stanford Medicine utilized DNA sequencing ” to diagnose rare genetic diseases in an average of eight hours.” And an article about its achievement noted that DNA “sequencing is vital for diagnosing patients with diseases rooted in their DNA: Once doctors know the specific genetic mutation, they can tailor treatments accordingly.” Moreover, DNA sequencing is a vital component of personalized medicine, which is becoming more and more prevalent.Illumina has a huge  80% share of the global sequencing market, making it basically the Google of sequencing. Although it does have competitors, it appears to be staying ahead of them, unveiling a new , lower-cost line of sequencers last year.And in conjunction with its most recent earnings report, ILMN stated that the orders for its new sequencers were four times higher than during the last time it launched new ones.Booking.com (BKNG)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAccording to BusinessofApps, Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG)  is “the largest online travel agency by booking volume and revenue, responsible for 25 percent of all hotel bookings worldwide.” I think it’s a safe bet that both travel and the internet are going to remain extremely popular for the next 20 years. That being said, Booking remains very well-positioned to continue to be the leader of the online travel agency sector during that time.With hundreds of millions of more citizens in China, India, and many other developing countries reaching middle-class status, enabling them to embark on international travel,  BKNG has a great deal of room to grow in the coming decades.In an indication of the growing strength of the global travel market, British bank Barclays in Nov. estimated that the global leisure travel sector would expand 12% this year. Also noteworthy is that the fund controlled by George Soros, who’s generally a very savvy investor, made BKNG stock its second largest new buy in the third quarter of last year.Fortinet (FTNT)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) has clearly become a leader within the cybersecurity sector. And last Oct., the very well-respected research firm, McKinney, reported that , “Cyberattacks are proliferating, causing trillions of dollars of damage every year.” The firm reported that in a 2022 survey of midsized companies, almost 80% reported that they has experienced cyber threats in 2021. McKinney believes that the cybersecurity market is expanding at a hefty annual rate of 12.4% and, over time, could expand from a $150 billion market in 2021 to $2 trillion. It also predicts that the damage from cyberattacks could reach $10.5 trillion in 2025, representing a 300% surge from 2015 levels.Moreover, FTNT has multiple solutions for remote workers, leaving it well-positioned for the work-from-home era. In 2022, Fortinet’s top line surged a very impressive 33%, and the company stated that its market share in the IT security sector rose in 2022. Finally, the company’s 2022 operating income jumped an incredible 67% year-over-year to $358 million. The data shows that FTNT is thriving in the IT security sector, and all indications are that it will continue to do so.PayPal (PYPL)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has clearly become the leader of the digital payment sector. As a result, the company is very well-positioned to benefit tremendously from the continued transition to digital payments.Over time, PayPal’s expanding alliances with e-commerce giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are likely to cause the growth of the fintech company’s top and bottom lines to accelerate.Also noteworthy is that the company has avoided becoming closely involved with  the crypto sector, preventing its reputation and balance sheet from being hurt by crypto’s deteriorating prices and status in society.Over the last three years, PayPal’s top line has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Meanwhile, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, have jumped at a compound annual growth rate of about 17%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in MGM and ILMN.

30,da4dfb94-1cd9-3c4c-b38f-3f270c1deb99,IT,2023-02-15,4 ways CFOs can maximize their A.I. investments,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-ways-cfos-maximize-investments-121730534.html,1676377050,STORY,['IT'],"[Good morning,Artificial intelligence, machine learning, ChatGPT—these advanced technologies are becoming part of the conversation about the future of business. But what are CFOs saying?To find out, I had a chat with Alexander Bant, chief of research for CFOs at consulting firm Gartner (NYSE: IT). Finance chiefs know that autonomous A.I. applications are an inevitable part of their future, Bant says. But only a third of finance teams who Gartner spoke with are experimenting with or implementing A.I. this year, he says. “CFOs are on a five-year roadmap to see returns from their artificial intelligence investments in finance,” he says.A big thing holding finance teams back? Finance professionals don't fully trust A.I. “A lot of finance teams are experimenting with it,” Bant explains. There’s still “a lot of old school, traditional thinking,” of running models and having a “constant verification process,"" Bant says. And that holds finance teams back from ""unlocking the actual benefits of artificial intelligence,” he says.Building that trust will take time. It may take “a continuous feedback loop, where you're iterating and experimenting with A.I.,” Bant says. Another piece is having the right talent to understand the A.I. applications. A recent Gartner survey found only 10% of finance departments can attract A.I. talent that CFOs believe they need, he says.ChatGPT, an example of generative A.I., is a chatbot launched by OpenAI in November. It can answer questions and write everything from complex computer code to an essay on best gardening practices to a legal brief. But it will be a while before CFOs reach a trust level with something like ChatGPT, Bant says. Right now, the data is based solely on historical records, and not necessarily certified, he says. Mira Murati, chief technology officer at OpenAI, told Time in an interview released last week that regulators will need to get involved with ChatGPT and govern the use of A.I. in a way that's “aligned with human values.”Story continuesSo are there any areas where CFOs and their teams are leaning into A.I.?Accounting processes like travel and expense (T&amp;E) reporting, Bant says. “In the process of T&amp;E, they can apply [A.I.] to a set of data to find savings opportunities and flag risks,” he says. Finance teams also feel more comfortable using A.I.-driven forecasting models in the financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A) space, like cash flow forecasting, Bant says. “They can actually be predictive and offer more accuracy, speed, and explanations behind how they're planning,” he says. And that’s of big interest, especially in this volatile economic environment, he says.Over time, in the accounting components of finance and transaction processing, there will most likely be a reduction in headcount due to the application of robotics, machine learning, and A.I., Bant says. On the other hand, FP&amp;A teams will hire more staff, not only to implement A.I. but then “use a lot of the insights that will come out of the artificial intelligence in order to guide and steer the business,” he says.But to fully unlock the benefits of A.I., “Our research really shows that the mindset of the entire finance function needs to change,” Bant says. There are four ways leading organizations do this, he says:- Hire individuals with A.I. technology experience for specific roles. For example, statistics, programming, and business process understanding around A.I. Companies that hire new employees with these advanced skills are more likely to become leading A.I. finance organizations, according to Gartner.- Use software to experiment with A.I. Also make sure any outsourcing firms or consulting firms that you're working with have a roadmap for A.I. and are making strong investments in those areas.- When you experiment with A.I., run more broad experiments across the finance function, which is what top finance A.I. organizations do. “A lot of companies, especially in this environment, are being conservative in the technology experimentation that they’re doing,” Bant says.- Choose the right person to head A.I. deployments, like the head of FP&amp;A or finance analytics. This leader would also need to emphasize to the organization the A.I. journey. That practice may include discussing it during new hire orientation or even in town halls, for example.Although trust is an issue right now, A.I. will seemingly find a permanent place in risk-averse finance teams.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Revenue rose 26% to $255.98 billion.Record profits from energy giants like Shell, BP and ExxonMobil last year have stirred calls for those companies to do more to reduce high utility bills for households and businesses and invest more in efforts to cut climate-changing emissions.The surge in cash generation narrowed Glencore's net debt to $100 million, “allowing for today’s announcement of $7.1 billion ... of shareholder returns” through cash distributions and a share buyback program, CEO Gary Nagle said in a statement.He also pointed to some potential upsides ahead, including China lifting tough zero-COVID restrictions. That's despite higher inflation and interest rates that present “some risk” to the economic forecast this year.“China’s reopening, however, together with a continued global focus on energy security and decarbonization (and) electrification, mean that demand for many of our commodities is likely to remain healthy, while supply constraints persist and inventories remain relatively low,” Nagle said.Glencore also could benefit from U.S. legislation that directs new spending toward technology meant to reduce carbon emissions and a European Union plan to favor greener policies.Such initiatives “demonstrate the growing need for critical raw materials through to the end of the decade and beyond, necessitating fresh investment in both primary supply and recycling,” Nagle said.Glencore's record profits come after it reached a deal with authorities in the United States, Britain and Brazil last year to resolve corruption and market manipulation allegations in return for penalties totaling up to $1.5 billion.]"

If you want to see more most profitable bank stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In.Many big banks did not do well during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Given home values decreased substantially in 2008, some financial institutions that made riskier loans lost a lot of money. Considering the economy slowed substantially in 2008, even more financial institutions lost a lot of money as well. With the slowing economy, leading investment bank Lehman Brothers eventually went bankrupt, and the government had to eventually bail out some of the big banks.As a result of the financial crisis, some big banks were labeled as systemically important, meaning their failure could lead to instability in the financial system.Although shareholders of systematically important institutions could still lose all their money if the institution failed, the government placed more regulation on those systemically important institutions and as a result, many of the big banks had to have more capital than before that weighed on their profitability.Nevertheless, big banks have done well over the last ten years given the growing U.S. economy even though there has been some dips due to market declines or the pandemic. Many U.S. banks have also benefited from higher interest rates. Many banks find it easier to make more in net interest margin when interest rates are a little higher than when they are near zero.Although interest rates have risen substantially in 2022, many big bank stocks did not do well, however.One reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also led to a considerable increase in U.S. Treasury yields. As a result of substantially higher Treasury yields, a lot of capital moved from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and many leading equity stock valuations decreased as a result.Another reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also increased the chance of a recession. If there is a recession, bank loan losses could increase and this could lead to lower than expected profits or even losses that might send their stocks lower.Story continuesWhile inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year, many expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. If it raises rates too much further, the odds of a recession or an economic slowdown that might send bank stocks lower will increase.Given some companies might underperform or the economy could worsen, leading bank stocks might not achieve their potential. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.kmichal/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In, we took the 10 largest banks by market capitalization in the United States and ranked them based on the amount of TTM net income they had according to YCharts.Because we used YCharts data, the net income data might not be adjusted earnings.10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In10.

If you want to skip reading about George Soros' investing philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, you can go directly to George Soros' Top 5 Holdings.George Soros is a Hungarian-born American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author. He is widely considered one of the most successful investors in the world and is the founder of Soros Fund Management, a New York-based investment management company that is now structured as a family office. According to Forbes, George Soros has a real-time net worth of $6.7 billion, as of February 14.George Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970 and ran it as a hedge fund up till 2011, averaging an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. Soros Fund Management has been dubbed as one of the most successful hedge funds in history. In 2011, Soros restructured Soros Fund Management as a family office and has since been focusing on his personal investments. Soros has also been an advocate of philanthropy and has donated billions of dollars to various charitable causes.Soros' Investing PhilosophySoros is famous for his investment philosophy that aims to take advantage of market inefficiencies. He is a proponent of reflexivity, a theory that states that market prices may be affected by changes in the beliefs, perceptions, and expectations of market participants. Soros has a long history of making successful investments. In 1992, he famously made over $1 billion by betting against the British pound, a feat that earned him the title ""The Man Who Broke the Bank of England"". Soros is known for his contrarian approach to investing. He often takes positions that are contrary to popular opinion, and has been able to make substantial profits in the process.Soros believes that markets are constantly changing and that investors must be vigilant and adaptable in order to stay ahead of the game. He looks for mispricings in the market and takes advantage of them. He is also an advocate of diversification and believes that investors should spread their money across multiple asset classes and sectors.Story continuesSoros believes in taking calculated risks and is not afraid to short stocks or go against the grain. Soros is a believer in the power of leverage and has made a fortune from using it. He believes that leveraging can amplify the returns of an investment, but it can also amplify losses if not used properly.Soros Fund Management: 13F PortfolioIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Soros Fund Management exited 144 positions, reduced its exposure to 32 securities, increased its exposure to 38 securities, and initiated new 82 positions.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We pared our exposure to LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA), Genmab and Advanced Drainage Systems in Q4. LPL Financial is the largest independent broker-dealer in the US, and the largest provider of outsourced wealth management services to banks. The company equips over 21,000 financial advisors with the tools—research, technology, compliance and administrative support—to grow their businesses and help their retail clients with wealth management and financial planning. In recent years, a new leadership team has invested to improve advisor technology and remove friction within advisors’ workflows, driving a 50% increase in productivity while increasing advisor retention to ~98%. We believe LPL is well-positioned to capture further market share and benefit from a migration of advisors away from wire houses to the independent channel. We also feel optimistic that their outsourcing contract wins with third-party banks and traction in the company’s new service offerings could further accelerate growth. Lastly, LPL has benefited from higher interest rates. However, as the share price now reflects more of these tailwinds, we modestly pared our position.”13. indie Semiconductor, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INDI) is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected car, user experience, and electrification applications. We elected to take a tax loss on our prior position and have been rebuilding on recent weakness. We believe that the automotive semiconductor vertical is attractive as silicon content in cars increases over time from improving safety features and autonomous driving, electrification, and premiumization of interior and exterior features. Indie is a small but rapidly growing player in the automotive semiconductor space and has a multi-billion dollar contracted backlog, providing strong visibility to its revenue ramp in the coming years. Since coming public, the company has beaten expectations every quarter and is on track to turn profitable in 2023 and achieve targeted 60% gross and 30% operating margins by 2025. Indie’s management team has previously built a semiconductor company from the ground up, achieving a successful exit, giving us high confidence in their ability to execute their strategic plan with indie as well.”12.

Horton primarily due to two key considerations:1) We believe the company is positioned to perform well over time given its status as the largest and lowest-cost producer in the entrylevel home segment for first-time buyers and baby boomers looking for an affordable home. In the last fiscal year, approximately 67% of D.R. Horton’s home sales were for prices less than $400,000, thereby enabling the company to satisfy the home affordability constraints of many potential home buyers.2) We are enthusiastic about D.R. Horton’s continued transition to a stronger and more asset-light balance sheet by outsourcing its land development spending needs to third-party developers such as Forestar Group Inc. D.R. Horton’s transition to a less capital-intensive business model is leading to stronger cash-flow generation, lower debt levels, an ability to pursue more share repurchases and/or other investment opportunities, and a higher-valuation multiple.”11.

(NASDAQ:AMZN): Amazon was the top detractor for the quarter on mixed 3Q results and disappointing 4Q guidance. For 3Q22, the company reported revenue of $127 billion, up 15% year over year. Operating income, however, declined 48% year over year on higher energy costs and some onetime items. AWS operating income continues to grow from cloud computing adoption, up 11% year over year to $5 billion. 4Q guidance includes slowing AWS growth and lower-thanexpected operating income guidance, as the company continues to face inflationary headwinds (including energy, labor and freight).With its ability to continue its market share gains in three leading businesses (e-commerce, web services and online advertising), plus a multi-year operating margin expansion opportunity (from improved e-commerce margins and greater contribution from the faster growing, higher margin AWS and advertising segments), we believe Amazon remains one of the best-positioned global growth companies in the world. AMZN shares trade at a 10-year trough EPS multiple, despite what we believe to be currently depressed margins and earnings.”10. Signify Health, Inc.

Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”8.

49,ebc23dea-e460-3257-9598-c64effa324f8,FLS,2023-02-15,Flowserve (FLS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flowserve-fls-expected-beat-earnings-150003776.html,1676386803,STORY,"['FLS', 'NDSN']","[Flowserve (FLS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.01 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.63% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flowserve?For Flowserve, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Flowserve will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Flowserve would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.09, delivering a surprise of -62.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Flowserve appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Nordson (NDSN) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $625.87 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Nordson has been revised 0.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.68%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Nordson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Political strife the country is facing after President Kais Saied assumed broader powers in July 2021 has amplified worries about default risk, as has his deadlock with the powerful labor unions.Read also: Wave of Tunisian Arrests Escalates Crackdown as Economy FoundersIn December, the IMF postponed a meeting of its executive board to review an agreement that its staffers reached two months earlier with Tunisian authorities on a four-year, $1.9 billion loan. Authorities also said they planned to refile an economic reform plan with the IMF in January.Enthusiasm initially triggered by the deal quickly ceded to growing tensions domestically. At the same time, Saied, who has final say on such matters, has repeatedly dismissed the urgency for securing foreign aid.Still, the managing director’s comments suggest that progress is being made, even as the unions dig in against Saied and a crackdown on on his critics has escalated.Georgieva said the IMF has “heard from the friends of Tunisia that the financial support for Tunisia is forthcoming.”Story continuesThe powerful UGTT union, which had initially backed Saied’s power grab, has accused officials of reneging on a wage hike agreement for public sector workers that was key to securing the staff level deal with the IMF.Among the toughest issues yet to be resolved is the fate of a bloated public sector and over 100 state-owned enterprises where the UGTT holds powerful sway.When the government last week announced a draft decree dealing with those companies, the plan drew quick criticism from the union. At the same time, Tunisians are struggling with record high inflation, shortages of basic goods and a rising youth unemployment rate.Any IMF deal would also likely involve cutting spending to bring under control the public sector wage bill, as well as easing subsidies — changes likely to further fuel inflation and batter a population whose frustration was evident with record low turnout in two recent parliamentary votes.--With assistance from Souhail Karam.(Updates throughout with detail, context)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Ben &amp; Jerry’s Ended Up at War With ItselfChatGPT Becomes a New Target for Right-Wing CommentatorsSocial Media Case Tests Limits of Supreme Court’s Tech SavvyUK Getting It ‘Totally Wrong’ on Soaring Child Care CostsThe Pandemic Sent US Consumers Back to the Sugar Bowl©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to see more most profitable utility stocks now, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now.In this article, we discuss utility companies in the United States.Utility companies provide essential services such as electricity, natural gas, and water.Given how essential the services are, many utility companies in the U.S. are regulated by the government in the United States. In exchange for providing services, many regulated utilities can get a return on their rate base decided by regulators.Sometimes the return on their rate base is better than expected. Sometimes the return on their rate base is worse than expected.S&amp;P Global explains rate base,A utility's rate base is essentially the company's ""prudent"" capital investment, as determined by the applicable regulatory authority’s net of accumulated depreciation. Stated differently, it is the net asset base from which the utility provides electric, gas or water service, and upon which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, usually the company's weighted average cost of capital. Thus, the rate base value is a key variable in the determination of a utility's revenue requirement.While there are many utilities that are regulated in the United States, there are also many deregulated utilities or unregulated utilities in the United States that don't get a return on their rate base, however, as competition ultimately decides how well they do.Regulations are also different in countries outside of the United States as every country is different in terms of how they regulate their utilities.Renewable EnergyGiven the need to invest in new renewable energy infrastructure to meet emission regulations, some leading regulated utilities have increased their rate base as a result. The increase in their rate base has allowed them to increase earnings.In terms of green energy, electric utility companies have also faced more competition as rooftop solar adoption has increased and increasing heat pumps adoption has also represented competition for natural gas companies. The effect of the competition is different for each utility, however, depending on whether a utility is regulated or deregulated, the effect of the regulations, and many other factors. In the long term, utilities may need to innovate to adjust to the changes. In the near term, however, many of the leading regulated utilities do have EPS growth potential if regulators allow them to grow their earnings.Story continuesAlthough leading regulated utility companies do have earnings growth potential in the near term, events like wildfires like what occurred to PG&amp;E could affect the utility's value and the industry does face more competition in the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in 2022. As a result, U.S. treasury yields have increased considerably and substantial capital has moved from leading equities into the U.S. Treasury market. The capital outflow has decreased valuations for many stocks including many utilities.michaeljung/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now, we took the 15 most valuable utilities in the United States by market capitalization and we ranked them by the amount of net income (TTM) they had according to YCharts.Of the 15, we took the top 12.Because some companies have not posted their earnings results for Q4, the trailing twelve months for different companies might not be the same time frames as some could end in September 30 and some could end in December 31. Because we used YCharts data, the net income might not be adjusted income either.12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now12. American Water Works Company, Inc.

53,a01ebcf6-bcc8-3a88-9d1f-c3452b89325c,PCG,2023-02-15,Bid to keep California reactors running faces time squeeze,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bid-keep-california-reactors-running-003144329.html,1676334704,STORY,"['PCG', 'PCGU']","[LOS ANGELES (AP) — A late-hour attempt to extend the life of California’s last nuclear power plant has run into a predicament that will be difficult to resolve: a shortage of time.A state analysis Monday predicted it will take federal regulators until late 2026 to act on an application to extend the operating run of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. The problem is that the plant is scheduled to shut down permanently by mid-2025.The future of the state’s remaining reactors could hinge on operator Pacific Gas &amp; Electric’s request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an unusual exemption that would allow the decades-old reactors to continue making electricity while the NRC reviews the application – not yet filed -- to extend its licenses for as much as two decades.One reactor is scheduled to close in November 2024, and its twin in August 2025. The plant is located on a seaside bluff, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco.On Monday, anti-nuclear activists and national environmental groups urged the federal agency to reject the request, saying in a petition that the exemption would amount to a dangerous, unprecedented shortcut that would expose the public to safety risks from reactors that began operating in the mid-1980s.“There is absolutely no precedent for the exemption requested by PG&amp;E. The NRC has never allowed a reactor to operate past its license expiration dates without thoroughly assessing the safety and environmental risks,"" Diane Curran, an attorney for the anti-nuclear advocacy group Mothers for Peace, said in a statement.The dispute over the potential exemption is the latest battlefront in a long-running fight over the safety of the reactors. Construction of the Diablo Canyon plant began in the 1960s and critics say potential shaking from nearby earthquake faults, not recognized when the design was first approved, could damage equipment and release radiation. One nearby fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&amp;E has long said the plant is seismically safe; federal regulators have agreed.Story continuesDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom — who once supported closing the plant — did a turnaround last year and argued it needed to keep running beyond the scheduled closure to ward off possible blackouts as the state transitions to solar and other renewable sources. At his urging, the Legislature dissolved a complex 2016 agreement among environmentalists, plant worker unions and the utility to close the plant by 2025, opening a pathway to keep it running longer. The utility said it changed direction given the energy policies adopted by the state.PG&amp;E officials have said they are eager for certainty about the plant’s future because of the difficulty of reversing course on a plant that was headed for permanent retirement, but now needs to prepare for a potentially longer lifespan.In October, the utility asked the NRC to resume consideration of an application initially submitted in 2009 to extend the plant’s life, which later was withdrawn after PG&amp;E in 2016 announced plans to shutter the reactors when the licenses expired.But the idea of going back in time to resume consideration of the previous filing was rejected by the agency, leaving PG&amp;E with the time-consuming task of submitting a new application that it expects to file by the end of the year.Reviewing a request for an extended license typically takes two years or more. Without extended licenses, that means one reactor, or both, might have to close while the NRC reviews the applications.That led to a separate request: PG&amp;E wants the NRC to allow the plant to continue running beyond its current, authorized term while the federal agency considers the license extensions. That ruling is not expected until next month.Typically, if a nuclear plant files for a license extension at least five years before the expiration of the existing license, the existing license remains in effect until the NRC's application review is complete, even if it technically passes the expiration date. But PG&amp;E would not meet the usual five-year benchmark.In documents submitted to the NRC, the company said the change it's seeking “will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.""Without the exemption, the NRC would have less than a year to conduct the license-extension review — far less time than is typical — before the current license expires and the plant would be required to close.The environmental groups said conducting a truncated review in just months “would be difficult if not impossible” and raise safety risks for a plant that until recently was headed for closure.Completion of the NRC review, before a longer run is permitted, is needed “to assure that continued operation of the reactors will be safe,” they wrote.]"

Marathon Oil (MRO), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This energy company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.76%.For the last reported quarter, Marathon Oil came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share, representing a surprise of 4.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.23 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.32 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.32%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Marathon Oil, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marathon Oil has an Earnings ESP of +3.28% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 15, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But when Microsoft asked its Bing virtual assistant to plan the perfect holiday in Mexico City, it produced a result that was not quite up to the standard of a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet tour book.Suggesting a good site for nightlife, the bot recommended a bar which it claimed was “popular among a young crowd”, despite there being just one Tripadvisor review – from 2014.In a later portion of Microsoft's demonstration of the software – touted as a potential “Google killer” – it was asked to analyse a financial filing, but returned a summary filled with mistakes and made up figures.“You see, this is just so much better than today’s search,” said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s vice president for search during the demo. It was only later that the litany of errors came to light – carrying with them a host of questions about the accuracy of technology allegedly about to change the world.Microsoft’s new search tool combines search engine technology with software capable of holding a human-like conversation: a chatbot.The Microsoft bot, ChatGPT, was developed by artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI to provide human-sounding answers to questions, and can even be used to write articles, analyse financial documents or create computer code.“I am shocked that the Bing team created this pre-recorded demo filled with inaccurate information, and confidently presented it to the world as if it were good,” wrote Dmitri Brereton, an internet search expert who spotted the flaws.Last week, Google made similar mistakes with its own artificial intelligence programme, known as Bard. In an official advert for its new tool, it gave an incorrect answer to what deep space telescope took the first pictures of a planet outside of the solar system.That mistake wiped more than $120bn (£98bn) off Google parent company Alphabet’s market capitalisation.Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Search - AP Photo/Stephen BrashearThe errors have taken the shine off the new search engine war into which both tech giants are pumping billions of dollars. Microsoft and Google have each raced to apply chatbot algorithms to their internet search products.Story continuesTheir ChatGPT and Bard programmes are forms of so-called “generative” AI, which perform in a very different way to a classic search engine, according to Mike Wooldridge, an Oxford University computer science professor.“Old fashioned search has a huge list of websites that answer questions. When you type in a search query for, say, ‘U2 tickets’, they go through their database for content that lists U2 tickets,” he says.“What Bard and ChatGPT are doing is completely different. They are doing a fancy version of what your phone does when it tries to autocomplete a message.”To provide its human-like “voice”, ChatGPT was trained on the whole of the English language version of Wikipedia, two vast volumes of published books and thousands of gigabytes of internet pages. This huge pool of training data has made the chatbot very good at predicting which words generally follow each other in a sentence.Microsoft’s new ChatGPT-powered Bing search engine, currently accessible through a limited-scale public trial, harnesses this word association model and applies it to the entire internet, using existing search engine software to generate answers. These answers are provided in a separate answer box, a mini article designed to summarise the most relevant information.While it might sound convincing to readers of their output, these chatbots have little ability to distill fact from fiction when regurgitating information online. The bots can also notoriously make up content to fill in any knowledge gaps – what artificial intelligence experts refer to as hallucination.One example cited by a team of researchers at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University comes from Microsoft’s own demonstration of ChatGPT-powered Bing searches. Mehdi, the Microsoft executive, used the new software on stage to summarise a quarterly financial report. Close analysis showed that the numbers in the report bore no resemblance to the original.“Plainly speaking, the popular generative AI models such as ChatGPT are picking words to generate from a fixed vocabulary, instead of strictly copying and pasting facts from the source,” the researchers say.The James Webb Space Telescope - NASA TV/AFP via Getty ImagesWhat is more, search engines themselves are far from infallible. Every reader has seen them return dubious answers to search queries, or links to irrelevant websites. Yet in the latest evolution of search technology information contained in those useless links is now being stated as the authoritative answer to questions asked by equally clueless humans.An old proverb about “garbage in, garbage out” is whispered around search engines and AI technology by greybeards from the tech industry.Badly trained algorithms will churn out meaningless answers. But since both tech companies are deliberately opaque on how they built their tools, to protect their competitive advantages, it is hard to fully understand how they come up with results that manage to sound so convincing while still being completely wrong.If the cause of the problem lies somewhere between the chatbot part and the search engine part, then a question arises: what’s going wrong with the link between the two, and how can users be aware of when problems might be arising?“We don’t know how they combine the two,” Oxford University’s Wooldridge says. “The fact that the data sources used to train these models are hidden is indeed problematic.”A growing problem in computer science over the past decade or more has been the “black box problem”. Consumers are encouraged to use a system whose workings are completely opaque and then place implicit trust in its outputs.While this has helped chatbots provide confident sounding responses, it creates real problems for humans trying to quickly separate AI-generated facts from fiction. Wooldridge adds: “The difficulty for us is it is getting things wrong in a plausible way.”Steve Hsu,  an American physics professor and entrepreneur, says the language algorithms used by Bing and Google are trained for “plausible sentence completion and are not good at faithfully summarising complicated information”.Microsoft says its questionable demonstration of Bing with ChatGPT ran using a preview version. A spokesman says: “Over the past week alone, thousands of users have interacted with our product and found significant user value while sharing their feedback with us, allowing the model to learn and make many improvements already.“We recognise there is still work to be done and are expecting that the system may make mistakes during this preview period.”Those mistakes are, officially, errors thrown up by a still-under-construction project. Until the likes of Microsoft and Google open their magical black boxes, however, the risks of spreading falsehoods remain high.]"

Analysis finds Microsoft’s Bing flubbed a string of financial figures,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-wasn-t-only-one-110404354.html,1676459044,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[After a single mistake in Google’s demo of its new A.I. program erased billions of dollars in market value, employees complained that the company had rushed out the news to get ahead of Microsoft’s own A.I. announcement a day later.Except it turns out that Microsoft’s demo also contained answers that were incomplete, confusingly sourced, and, at worst, entirely incorrect, according to an analysis published by independent A.I. researcher Dmitri Brereton.These errors highlight a growing problem with A.I. chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard: Both employees and users seem to trust that these bots’ well-written and conversational answers are accurate, meaning mistakes at a public event might go unnoticed for days.Wrong answersDuring Microsoft’s demo of its new chatbot, aired last week, the company’s corporate vice president for search, Yusuf Mehdi, asked the program for “key takeaways” from Gap’s most recent earnings report. The bot obliged with a series of bullet points with the company’s key financial data and even a comparison with fellow clothing company Lululemon’s most recent earnings.Yet Brereton found that Microsoft’s bot gave incorrect figures. For example, Bing's A.I. said that Gap’s operating margin, adjusted for impairment costs, was 5.9%. According to Gap’s earnings report, the company’s adjusted operating margin for the recent quarter was 3.9%. The unadjusted margin was 4.6%.Bing A.I. also said that Gap was forecasting sales growth in the low double digits in the coming quarter. In fact, Gap is projecting a decline in net sales in the “mid-single digits.”The demo also made mistakes when it came to Lululemon’s financial data. For example, Bing's A.I. reported that the clothing company’s operating margin in the most recent quarter was 20.7%. The company’s earnings report shows an adjusted operating margin of 19.4%.Further analysis from CNN uncovered that Bing's A.I. would attribute its answers to sources that did not contain the information in question.Story continuesMicrosoft hopes that programs like ChatGPT, which can generate conversational answers in response to text prompts, can undercut Google’s dominance in search. The company is investing $10 billion in ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI.Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tech company previously told Fortune that “the system may make mistakes during this preview period, and user feedback is critical to help identify where things aren’t working well,” in response to an earlier request for comment on strange responses from the Bing chatbot.Mistakes with Google’s BardMicrosoft competitor Google was recently hit hard by the revelation that Google’s A.I., titled Bard, made a factual error in its demo.In a blog post, Google included a video of a user asking the Bard A.I. for interesting facts about the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021. Google’s A.I. claimed the telescope was the first to discover a planet outside of our solar system. In fact, the first exoplanet was discovered by the Very Large Telescope array in Chile in 2004.Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, crashed 8% after the error was first reported by Reuters, wiping out around $100 billion of the company’s market capitalization.At a conference Monday, Alphabet chairman John Hennessy said that these kinds of mistakes were why the company hesitated to announce its own ChatGPT competitor. “You don’t want to put a system out that either says wrong things or sometimes says toxic things,” he said, according to CNBC.Hallucinated answersPeople testing these chatbots are discovering that certain prompts can lead to strange results, including instances where the bot responds with argumentative or “unhinged” answers.

67,3dee069b-a294-38ef-954e-7376a74f9a37,SBUX,2023-02-15,Tesla workers trying to unionize are turning to the group that launched Starbucks’ nationwide union wave,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-workers-trying-unionize-turning-095135497.html,1676454695,STORY,"['SBUX', 'TSLA']","[A wave of unionizations that helped revitalize the American labor movement started at a Starbucks in Buffalo, N.Y., when baristas formed the coffee company’s first union in December 2021.Now, the same union that helped those Starbucks workers is assisting Tesla employees form the electric carmaker’s first U.S. union at a factory just six miles away, reports Bloomberg. Over two dozen employees sent a letter to Tesla management early Tuesday, saying the union wanted to strengthen the company and fight for better working conditions, job security, and pay. In a note shared on Twitter, the prospective union, called Tesla Workers United, said it was working with Workers United Upstate New York.https://twitter.com/united_tesla/status/1625472365202219013?s=20u0026t=_xSgK4QtBxFvmFimBdfQhQ“We want Tesla to be the company we know it to be,” the petition said. “We believe that by having a union, we will further the mission of sustainability and foster a progressive environment for us all.”The Buffalo factory has about 2,000 employees, about 800 of whom work for the company’s Autopilot division, the technology that allows Tesla’s cars to maneuver controls automatically. The remainder of the workers are part of manufacturing or other functions, according to the Wall Street Journal. The announcement about Tesla workers’ attempting to unionize comes after a slew of unionization efforts shaped the U.S. labor movement in 2021 and 2022. Companies like Apple, Amazon and Starbucks have long operated without dealing with unions, but in the last year, labor organizers clocked in big wins by successfully holding elections for unions and pushing for changes in working conditions. Even still, the union membership rate, which is measured by the percentage of salary and wage workers who are part of unions, broadly fell last year.Since December 2021, when Starbucks workers first organized in Buffalo, over 250 more stores have voted in favor of unionizing. The company has adopted a hardline stance towards its unions. Starbucks has yet to agree to or sign any contracts with its unions, even though it has said it’s open to discussions. With executives pushing back and negotiations faltering, the unionization effort in the world’s largest coffeehouse chain has begun to slow in recent months with a softer pace of contract bargaining.Unions are common in the auto industry, compared to companies like Starbucks and Apple.Long-established auto industry behemoths like Ford, Mercedes Benz and General Motors have unions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.Tesla, unlike its legacy counterparts, does not have a unionized workforce in the U.S. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in 2021 that Musk violated labor laws by firing a union activist at Tesla, and the NLRB requested he remove a 2018 tweet in which he discouraged unions (the tweet is still online). Musk then invited workers at an auto union to vote on potentially unionizing at Tesla, and said the company would “do nothing to stop them,” the Journal reported.In 2022, Tesla laid off about 200 staffers at the company’s San Mateo, Calif. office. Musk, who has also been CEO of Twitter since last October, was recently acquitted of charges from a class action lawsuit he faced after tweeting that he had the funding secured to take the auto-maker private back in 2018. The Tesla Workers Union did not immediately not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment. Tesla did not reply to Fortune’s request for comment—the company’s public relations department was dissolved in 2020.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restThe best 5 ways to earn passive incomeThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero has the latest. Hey, Dani.DANI ROMERO: Yes, Rachelle, so Starbucks is facing the pressure once again but this time is a little bit different. A group of Starbucks workers at a Philadelphia store started their own unionized efforts, but they were cut short. They are allegedly accusing Starbucks of threatening, interrogating, and also terminating prounion workers. As of Monday, the three Democratic members from the National Labor Relations Board ordered Starbucks to cease and desist. And they also offered reinstatement with back pay, excuse me, for terminating those two employees.And now we reached out to Starbucks in regards to their side of the story. And they tell us, ""We disagree with the decision and our considering all options to obtain a full legal review of that matter."" Now, the company continues to say that any claims in regards to antiunion activity are categorically false. They also, the NLRB can-- the ruling of the NLRB can be appealed in federal court.But I also want to give a little bit of background. Allegedly those two workers recorded video without consent, which is against the Philadelphia-- which is against, excuse me, Pennsylvania State law. So that's a little bit of the background.But so far, according to Starbucks Workers United, there are more than 270 stores that have filed-- successfully filed unionization. And there are more than 315 stores that are filing for union elections. Rachelle?- I mean, when you look at the rate of success for some of these that are trying to unionize, you're getting pressure from the unions. You're getting pressure from the states as well. How is Starbucks-- how do you think this is going to work out for Starbucks when you look at some of the momentum that we're seeing?Story continuesDANI ROMERO: Well, obviously, we saw a huge wave, right, just in 2021. But again, like I said, this case is a little bit different because those unionized efforts started way beforehand, in 2019. But again, Starbucks has made their claim that they are not against-- they're actually for their partners. And, obviously, things are rolling out. And this isn't the first claim against Starbucks that we have seen that the National Labor Relations Board has voted and been on the side of the partners.So I think it's a wait and see. But, obviously, this movement is progressing. I mean, if there's 300, more than 315 stores that have filed for unionization, I mean, we're really seeing this activity pick up.- Indeed. Dani Romero, thank you so much for that update on Starbucks there.]"

If you want to see more most profitable utility stocks now, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now.In this article, we discuss utility companies in the United States.Utility companies provide essential services such as electricity, natural gas, and water.Given how essential the services are, many utility companies in the U.S. are regulated by the government in the United States. In exchange for providing services, many regulated utilities can get a return on their rate base decided by regulators.Sometimes the return on their rate base is better than expected. Sometimes the return on their rate base is worse than expected.S&amp;P Global explains rate base,A utility's rate base is essentially the company's ""prudent"" capital investment, as determined by the applicable regulatory authority’s net of accumulated depreciation. Stated differently, it is the net asset base from which the utility provides electric, gas or water service, and upon which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, usually the company's weighted average cost of capital. Thus, the rate base value is a key variable in the determination of a utility's revenue requirement.While there are many utilities that are regulated in the United States, there are also many deregulated utilities or unregulated utilities in the United States that don't get a return on their rate base, however, as competition ultimately decides how well they do.Regulations are also different in countries outside of the United States as every country is different in terms of how they regulate their utilities.Renewable EnergyGiven the need to invest in new renewable energy infrastructure to meet emission regulations, some leading regulated utilities have increased their rate base as a result. The increase in their rate base has allowed them to increase earnings.In terms of green energy, electric utility companies have also faced more competition as rooftop solar adoption has increased and increasing heat pumps adoption has also represented competition for natural gas companies. The effect of the competition is different for each utility, however, depending on whether a utility is regulated or deregulated, the effect of the regulations, and many other factors. In the long term, utilities may need to innovate to adjust to the changes. In the near term, however, many of the leading regulated utilities do have EPS growth potential if regulators allow them to grow their earnings.Story continuesAlthough leading regulated utility companies do have earnings growth potential in the near term, events like wildfires like what occurred to PG&amp;E could affect the utility's value and the industry does face more competition in the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in 2022. As a result, U.S. treasury yields have increased considerably and substantial capital has moved from leading equities into the U.S. Treasury market. The capital outflow has decreased valuations for many stocks including many utilities.michaeljung/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now, we took the 15 most valuable utilities in the United States by market capitalization and we ranked them by the amount of net income (TTM) they had according to YCharts.Of the 15, we took the top 12.Because some companies have not posted their earnings results for Q4, the trailing twelve months for different companies might not be the same time frames as some could end in September 30 and some could end in December 31. Because we used YCharts data, the net income might not be adjusted income either.12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now12. American Water Works Company, Inc.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Xcel Energy (XEL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this utility a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Xcel is 6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 6.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.2%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Xcel is 7.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Xcel. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.Bottom LineXcel has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Xcel is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, business never stays easy for decades, so only 48 out of the many thousands of publicly traded companies can claim this distinction.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), more commonly known as ADM, achieved that milestone this year when it increased its quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.45. But theres more to this company than just a rising dividend - it's also a growth stock with solid fundamentals.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with POOL. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?About ADMThe companys history goes back to 1902, when George A. Archer and John W. Daniels founded a linseed crushing business. Today, the Chicago, Illinois-based business has a market cap of $44.86 billion and trailing 12-month revenue of $101.848 billion.In its 10-K for 2021, the company called itself a global leader in sustainable human and animal nutrition, one of the worlds premier agricultural origination and processing companies, and an innovator in creating sustainable solutions in agriculture, energy, and bio-based alternatives to materials and fuels currently produced from petroleum products.It operates through three segments:Ag Services and Oilseeds: origination, merchandising, transportation and storage of agricultural raw materials, as well as the crushing and processing of oilseeds.Carbohydrate Solutions: Wet and dry milling of corn and wheat, mainly. The outputs from milling include products and ingredients such as sweeteners, starches and wheat flour.Nutrition: Manufacturing, selling and distributing a wide array of ingredients and solutions. These products go into food, beverage, nutritional supplements, feed and premix for livestock, aquaculture and pet food.Story continuesAs this slide from the third-quarter 2022 investor presentation shows, Ag Services and Oilseeds is the biggest profit-maker:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingCompetitionADM reported in its annual filing that it faces significant competition based mainly on price, currency exchange rates, quality, global supply and alternative products. It added that because of the commodity nature of many of its businesses, it focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency. That latter is accomplished through technology improvements, productivity enhancements and regular assessments of its asset portfolio.Presumably, those cost and efficiency improvements would be two of its key competitive advantages. The company also has its global footprint, scale and experience.Despite those advantages, it has had trouble keeping up with the S&amp;P 500 as well as the S&amp;P Consumer Staples Index:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingFinancial strengthBased on the GuruFocus criteria in the chart below, ADM receives a financial strength ranking of 7 out of 10:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingAs the above table suggests, the company carries a significant amount of debt (think inventory and manufacturing facilities). Not surprising since it is asset heavy.The interest coverage ratio at 10.64 is acceptable, but only slightly better than the industry average of 9.71. However, it is better now than it has been in the past.ProfitabilityBased on the factors listed below, ADM scores an 8 out of 10 ranking for profitability:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingThe operating margin, currently at 4.14%, is about average for the industry, but significantly better than where it has been in the past. The trend is headed in the right direction:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingThe Piotroski F-Score is very high at 8 out of 9. The consistency of profitability has been mediocre, but shareholders will have been pleased over the past three years as earnings per share without non-recurring items leapt past the trendline:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingGrowthAnother high ranking for ADM is its growth ranking of 9 out of 10. Thats based on its three-year and five-year revenue growth rates, the predictability of that revenue stream and its five-year Ebitda growth rate:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingThis 10-year chart shows that revenue has been predictable over the past three years. But over the past 10 years, it has been anything but predictable or consistent. Still, the growth ranking is based on whats happened over the past three and five years:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingThe Ebitda chart has a similar droop and recovery, and to some extent, thats also true of the EPS without NRI chart shown prior.The free cash flow chart diverges from revenue and Ebitda because it pulled back significantly in 2022. According to its fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings report, it posted less favorable results in two of three sources of cash flow. Operating activities brought in roughly $3 billion less, investing activities bucked the trend by posting less of a loss and financing activities incurred a bigger loss.According to Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) analysts, ADM is expected to show revenue of $101.848 billion for 2022 when fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings come out later this week. Short- and long-term debts are expected to add up to $9.180 billion.Dividends and share repurchasesADM became a Dividend King earlier this year, with its 50th annual and consecutive increase. The forward dividend yield, at 2.18% is slightly higher than the S&amp;P 500 long-term average of 1.85%. Thats well below the nearly 4.4% it registered before the share price picked up steam:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingThe dividend payout ratio is a comfortable 0.21, leaving lots of room for future increases. The three-year dividend growth rate averages 4.60%, while the five-year growth rate has averaged 4.20%.ADM bought back shares quite aggressively in 2015, 2016 and 2017. While it has continued to buy back shares since then, it has been at a much slower rate.ValuationBased on its price to GF Value ratio, ADM receives a GF Value rank of 6 out of 10. Its Feb. 13 closing price was $81.90 versus the GF Value of $87.79.Its price-earnings ratio of 10.62 is cheaper versus the industrys median of 17.88.Dividing the price-earnings ratio by the five-year average Ebitda growth rate of 16.30% per year produces a PEG ratio of 0.65. That suggests the stock is undervalued compared to its growth.This 10-year chart suggests the stock may be overvalued based on its historical trendline:Archer-Daniels-Midland Becomes a Dividend KingGurusNine gurus owned shares of ADM as per their most recent 13F reports as of this writing. The top three were Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) of Market Gayner Asset Management (1,463,300 shares), Murray Stahl (Trades, Portfolio) of Horizon Kinetics (1,015,230 shares) and Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) of GAMCO Investors (362,905 shares).The company receives significant support from institutional investors, who held 87.23% of the shares outstanding, while insiders owned 2.64%. Among the insiders, president and CEO Juan R. Luciano had the biggest holding, 762,330 shares as of Jan. 25.ConclusionArcher-Daniels-Midland has done what many companies can only dream of doing. It has become a Dividend King, and only a company with great staying power could achieve that distinction. There is moreto the story, though, because this is a company that has robustly beefed up its top and bottom lines over the past few years and looks undervalued based on several metrics.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of -10% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 points to a change of -14.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 indicates a change of -8% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +13.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $23.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.4%. The $99.93 billion and $100.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.9% and +0.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $26.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was +17.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Intel Corp., Synopsys, Inc. and FedEx Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Intel have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-41.6% vs. -14.8%). The company is facing uncertainty over the over-supplied chip markets that are weighing on its near-term outlook. More than other players in the space, the market is skeptical of Intel's ability to profitably operate and execute in this unfavorable environment. In addition, production delays remain a concern for the company.Imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden are other headwinds. It is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, networking and storage markets, while inflated raw material costs and signs of market saturation are worrisome. The Sino-US trade war is also adversely impacting its growth prospects.However, Intel is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market.     (You can read the full research Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Synopsys shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+21.8% vs. -10.5%). The company is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trends is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys' Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line.Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new computer and machine learning architectures. Our estimates suggest that Synopsys' revenues will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% through 2023-2025.However, Synopsys is hurting from supply-chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic. The company is also witnessing stiff competition. Geopolitical challenges coupled with uncertainties related to restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.(You can read the full research report on Synopsys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of FedEx have declined -8.4% over the past year against the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry's decline of -13.0%. The company's volumes are being hurt due to the decline in shipping demand, particularly in Asia and Europe. Weakening of e-commerce demand as economies re-open is another concern.To navigate the weaker-than-expected business environment, FDX is actively cutting costs. FedEx anticipates generating cost savings of nearly $3.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 estimate for capital expenditure has been slashed by $400 million to $5.9 billion.However, efforts to reward shareholders of FDX, through dividends and buybacks, are encouraging as well. In June 2022, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend by 53% to $1.15 per share. During fiscal 2022, FedEx repurchased shares worth $2.2 billion. FedEx's liquidity position is also impressive.(You can read the full research report on FedEx here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include First Solar, Inc. and Synchrony Financial.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

SPG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and National Retail Properties, Inc. NNN.Industry: REIT - RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2053271/3-retail-reit-stocks-to-stay-afloat-despite-industry-hiccupsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of inflationary pressure and economic slowdown. Rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism are likely to weigh down on consumers' willingness to spend. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords' cash flows.Nevertheless, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime amid limited new supply is likely to help industry fundamentals. Efforts to support omni-channel retailing, adaptive reuse capabilities and opportunities emanating from consolidations, and focus on e-commerce resistant sectors have poised Simon Property Group, Inc., Federal Realty Investment Trust and National Retail Properties, Inc. well for growth.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry embodies a group of REITs engaged in owning, developing, managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates. Among these are regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and power centers, including big-box retailers.Also, net lease REITs enjoy the ownership of freestanding properties, wherein both rent and the majority of operating expenses for the properties are borne by tenants. The overall health of the economy, job market and consumer spending are the main drivers of retail REITs, while property locations and trade area demographics play key roles in demand determination. Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies bothered this asset category in the past. However, shoppers' renewed enthusiasm for in-person shopping has helped the industry tide over.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?Inflationary Pressure, Rate Hike, Economic Slowdown to Make It Challenging: The retail real estate market is likely to remain challenging in the near term, given the inflationary pressure, higher interest rates and economic slowdown. Particularly, though inflation is moderating, it is still a concern as it is leading to the adoption of a more cautious spending attitude by consumers.Also, a slowdown in the job market and any potential impact on wage growth is likely to aggravate the woes, making shoppers more dependent on their savings and credit for purchases. Amid the uncertainty in the economic backdrop, the depletion of savings, the rising borrowing costs and the labor market pessimism, demand for retailers' goods is likely to dwindle. This, in turn, would temper the demand for the retail real estate space in the near term.Moreover, with a shortage of laborers, staffing of stores is likely to become challenging for retailers. Higher material and operating costs may remain as retailers' woes. These issues, in turn, are expected to moderate the demand for retail space as well as cast a pall on landlords' cash flows.Moreover, the dependence of REITs on debt for business is more compared to the other industries, making investors skeptical about their performance in a rising rate environment. Also, as the investment world treats REITs as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, these companies are susceptible to rising rates.Higher E-commerce Adoption to Remain a Concern: Consumers' habits have transformed at a rapid pace over the past years and traffic at retail real estates has suffered, with e-commerce capturing market share from brick-and-mortar stores. With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. Yet, given the convenience it offers, online shopping is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. This might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Omni-Channel Strategy, Structural Changes in Focus: Omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. In fact, consumers these days prefer to research products online but buy or pick up in stores. Amid this, click-and-collect sales are likely to gain momentum.Moreover, digitally-native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy since the opening of stores helps them to improve their connection with customers and drive expansion. Therefore, for retailers, the focus now is not only on increasing their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations.Renewed Enthusiasm for In-Store Shopping Experience Amid Limited Supply to Aid Fundamentals: This industry is poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers as they look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. However, comparing to the pre-pandemic levels, the construction of new retail space remains dreary amid high construction costs.Also, with struggling malls and centers' landlords opting for mixed-use developments over the past years, a sizeable part of retail space has been removed from the market. This limited supply is likely to support the retail real estate industry fundamentals even amidst the challenging economic backdrop and its corresponding impact on retail demand.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #169, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's FFO per share estimates for 2022 have declined 2.0%. The same for 2023 has moved 9.7% south over the past year.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Finance sector in a year's time.The industry has declined 1.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 8.7%. Meanwhile, the broader Finance sector has declined 7.8%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Retail REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.04X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 18.46X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 14.31X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.54X, as low as 10.32X, with a median of 15.28X.3 Retail REIT Stocks to ConsiderSimon Property Group: This retail REIT is a behemoth in its industry and enjoys a portfolio of premium retail assets in the United States and abroad. The adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers have been aiding the company. It is also tapping growth opportunities by assisting digital brands to enhance their brick-and-mortar presence, as well as capitalizing on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy.Additionally, Simon Property is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years among those who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Its better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. Moreover, with solid balance-sheet strength and available capital resources, Simon Property Group looks poised to well navigate the challenges and bank on opportunities emanating from market dislocations.Simon Property Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). SPG has a long-term growth rate of 3.50%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share is currently pegged at $12.02, suggesting 1.3% growth year over year. The stock has appreciated 5.8% in the past three months.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Federal Realty Investment Trust: This North Bethesda, MD-based retail REIT boasts a portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — along with a diverse tenant base, both national and local, which positions it well for decent growth.Federal Realty has strategically selected the first ring suburbs of nine major metropolitan markets. Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years.Federal Realty has expertise in raising its operating performance through conversion, redevelopment and repurposing of assets. Its focus on essential retail and mixed-use assets bodes well for long-term growth.Federal Realty's better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity and higher-than-expected revenues. This retail REIT provided an upbeat outlook for 2023, with FFO per share projection exceeding the consensus mark. Federal Realty also experienced strong small-shop leasing, ending the quarter at 90.0%. This marked an uptick of 260 bps year over year and the highest small-shop leased rate since the first quarter of 2017.Currently, FRT carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a long-term growth rate of 6.60%. Moreover, for 2023, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share being revised four cents upward to $6.38 over the past week. The stock has also gained 4.2% over the past three months.National Retail Properties, Inc.: This Orlando, FL-based retail REIT invests in high-grade retail properties subject usually to long-term net leases. NNN's portfolio comprised 3,411 owned properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of roughly 35.0 million square feet and with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years as of Dec 31, 2022.National Retail Properties' high-quality, diversified portfolio helps it to enjoy high occupancy. Also, long-term, net leases add stability to operating results, with tenants being responsible for operating expenses, taxes and capital expenditures.National Retail Properties' better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected higher-than-expected revenues. Moreover, its record-level property acquisitions in 2022, strong balance sheet position and steady free cash flow positions the company well to navigate any macroeconomic challenges in the current year.Currently, NNN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term growth rate of 3.90%. Moreover, for 2023, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share being revised marginally upward to $3.26 over the past week. This also suggests an increase of 1.56% year over year. The stock has also gained 4.7% in the past three months.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like American International Group (NYSE:AIG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide American International Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group How Fast Is American International Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?American International Group has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Outstandingly, American International Group's EPS shot from US$6.44 to US$18.47, over the last year. Year on year growth of 187% is certainly a sight to behold. The best case scenario? That the business has hit a true inflection point.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that American International Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The good news is that American International Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 15.3 percentage points to 31%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for American International Group's future profits.Are American International Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$46b company like American International Group. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$76m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Should You Add American International Group To Your Watchlist?American International Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American International Group for a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - American International Group has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

It also features the voice of Her Royal Highness Queen Diambi Kabatusuila, the current Queen of the Bakwa Luntu People in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Jada Pinkett Smith’s ‘African Queens’Speaking at the premiere held at the School of Oriental and African studies (SOAS) in London, Pinkett Smith said the inspiration behind the docuseries stemmed from a conversation with her daughter.“I was asking Willow what makes a queen and as we started talking about that, I started thinking about that question from more of a historical context. That is when the idea sprouted in my mind.”“We need to have more information and more content around Black queens that have lived.

The series follows in the footsteps of The Woman King, a period action film, which tells the story of the Agojie—a brigade of female warriors in Dahomey, present-day Benin.Kenya’s warrior, Mekatilili wa Menza, who led an army of women and men against British colonial rule has similarly been honored through an animated photography project. While in Zambia, women’s stories and histories are being documented in a digital archive in the Museum of Women’s History, which was opened in 2016.Story continuesIn African Queens, it is Queen Njinga, who ruled the kingdoms of Ndongo and Matamba, located in present-day Angola during the 17th century, who takes center stage. Born into the ruling family in Ndongo, she assumed power after the death of her father and brother.The nation’s first female ruler, Queen Njinga, quickly became an icon of resistance as she sought to fend off Portuguese colonists.Queen Njinga being carried on a throneQueen Njinga with her arms raisedQueen Njinga and a white man having an argumentQueen Njinga of Ndongo and MatambaIn the show’s synopsis, Njinga is described as having “a reputation for her blend of political and diplomatic skill with military prowess.” Before she assumed the throne she was enlisted by the former king to negotiate for peace with the Portuguese Governor. Her reign lasted nearly 40 years.“It was very important to have African writers,” said Kenyan-born writer, Peres Owino, who co-wrote the series together with NneNne Iwuji-Eme. “[Production company, Nutopia] wanted the African perspective on this story, which is different from a lot of the content you see.”“This is specifically the lens of African women and how we see ourselves, not how others see us or interpret who we are.”Owino says that the partnership with Netflix will ensure that Njinga’s unknown story can be taken across the world.“Njinga is the story of the beginning of the African diaspora. You figure out the people that are left behind and the people who are taken. That spans from Africa all the way to the Caribbean, the US and Latin America.”“But at the end of the day it is also a story about a human being and the pressure that was put upon her.”While the docuseries has so far been picked up for two seasons, lead actress, Adesuwa Oni, said more could be on the way.“Our history is that expansive—it could just run and run and I think that is a good thing.”More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

To skip our detailed analysis of the market's current condition, you can go directly to see Jim Cramer's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023.According to a CNBC article published this February, Cramer believes that the Federal Reserve was inching closer to beating inflation, despite what Wall Street thinks. The US economy has been in a state of downturn, making the market highly vulnerable and investors more cautious about investing in new companies.Cramer has still named stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the options investors should consider for their portfolios this year, considering his own optimism regarding the market. He has added that price stability is just around the corner, and while some weaker companies will most likely never be able to recover, high-end companies will manage to survive.While the Federal Reserve does not seem to be relenting entirely when it comes to interest rates, the hikes have gotten smaller.Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023Let's now take a look at Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 stocks that have been named by Jim Cramer on CNBC's Mad Money this January as his top picks for 2023. We have also mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks, ensuring they are positive. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 202310. Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is an industrial machinery company based in New Britain, Connecticut. It operates in the US, Canada, the rest of the Americas, France, the rest of Europe, and Asia. The company offers products like professional-grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment.On February 5, Barclay analyst Julian Mitchell reiterated an Overweight rating on Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) shares.Story continuesThis January, Jim Cramer recommended that investors should start a small position in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in 2023 and gradually buy more. He believes that the stock will continue to see gains in 2023 after its performance last year. Revenues for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) have increased by almost 70% over the past ten years. The stock's most attractive quality, however, is its status as a dividend king, with a record of 55 years of dividend increases. It has a yield of 3.59% as of February 14.Greenhaven Associates was the largest stakeholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in the fourth quarter, holding 1.3 million shares. In the third quarter, 26 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $447 million.Ariel Investments, an investment management company, mentioned Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), is among Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.9. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) is a utility company based in Columbus, Ohio. The company engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for sale in the US.Neil Kalton at Wells Fargo holds an Equal Weight rating on American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) shares as of February 1.In January, Cramer named American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) as one of the stocks he believes to be a worthwhile addition to investors' portfolios. He likes the stock because the company is well-run, and utility companies are known to perform well in an economic downturn. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) is also a dividend stock with a 3.64% yield as of February 14 and 13 years of dividend growth. Company management is also guiding for long-term 6%-7% annual operating earnings growth as of this February.There were 35 hedge funds long American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $671.3 million.8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an aerospace and defense company based in Falls Church, Virginia. The company designs and manufactures aircraft systems in the US and internationally. It also offers unmanned autonomous aircraft systems.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shares on February 6 by Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle.Jim Cramer this January commented that Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could be the best defense contracted to own as the Russo-Ukrainian war persists. In the fourth quarter, the company had robust sales growth of 16% year-over-year. Company management expects Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to see a 20% compound annual growth in its multi-year cash flow outlook, while analysts expected annual EPS growth of 10%-12% in 2024-2025.There were 46 hedge funds long Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in the third quarter, and their total stake value in the company was $1.1 billion. Yacktman Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company in the fourth quarter, holding 410,428 shares in the company.LRT Capital Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is an energy company based in Houston, Texas.

In the fourth quarter, the company reported a net profit of $656 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, up from $544 million, or $0.6 per share, in the previous quarter. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) had a full-year revenue of $20.3 billion, demonstrating an increase of 33% year-over-year.Our hedge fund data for the third quarter shows 48 hedge funds long Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), with a total stake value of $1 billion.Carillon Tower Advisers, an investment management company, mentioned Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Shares have been on an impressive trajectory recently, outpacing the notable move in the overall oilfield services and equipment group. Halliburton benefits from the ongoing upswing in global upstream spending and should play a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate the recent productivity declines in North American shale. The tight services and equipment market has resulted in strong pricing gains and margin expansion, and when coupled with a disciplined approach to capital spending, has paved the way for the stock’s outperformance.”6۔ McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a healthcare company based in Irving, Texas. The company distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare products.Morgan Stanley's Erin Wright holds an Overweight rating on McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) shares as of February 2.Cramer likes McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) in 2023 because he believes that stocks of drug distributors tend to perform well during an economic downturn. In the third quarter, the company's EPS was $6.9, up 12% year-over-year and higher than the consensus estimates of $6.35. Since McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) also drastically decreased its operating costs in that quarter, it generated an operating profit of $1.39 billion as well.Pzena Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) in the fourth quarter, holding 973,538 shares. A total of 51 funds were long the stock in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $4.1 billionBaron Funds, an investment management company, mentioned McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a leading distributor of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The company also provides prescription technology solutions that connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical customers. The stock price rose on solid financial results as its business is less exposed to current macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to have conviction that McKesson can grow earnings per share by an average of 12% to 14% annually and think the stock is still reasonably valued.”McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), is one of the stocks that is expected to perform well through 2023. Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023. Suggested articles:JP Morgan's 15 Best Performing Stock Picks for 2023Bank of America's Stock Picks for 202313 Most Profitable Large Cap StocksDisclosure: None.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Phillips 66's shares before the 17th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.05 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.88 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Phillips 66 has a trailing yield of 3.6% on the current share price of $108.26. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Phillips 66 is paying out just 16% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 21% of its cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Phillips 66's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Phillips 66 has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Phillips 66 an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Phillips 66 has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Phillips 66 is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Phillips 66 (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored).A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Think your friend or colleague should know about us? Forward this newsletter to them. They can also subscribe here.)By Nancy LapidFeb 14 (Reuters) -Welcome to Health Rounds! Pancreas cancer rates are climbing in the U.S., but they’re rising faster in younger women than in their male counterparts, a large study shows. Researchers say the increases are relatively small, but while they work to figure out the reasons, they hope awareness might refocus people on the need for lifestyle changes that help decrease the risk.In other news, a drug that delivers a cancer-killing virus directly into tumors may be an effective new alternative for patients with a hard-to-treat form of breast cancer. And instead of looking for new ways to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, researchers suggest finding ways to disable the organisms and make them less harmful.Pancreas cancer rates rising faster in young womenPancreas cancer rates in the United States are increasing faster in younger women than in their male counterparts, a large study has found.And while survival rates are improving overall, ""that improvement is largely among men. The mortality rate among women is not improving,"" Dr. Srinivas Gaddam of Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said in a statement.Gaddam's team used databases covering more than half the country to study pancreatic cancer rates between 2001 and 2018. During that period, the cancers were diagnosed in 454,611 patients, roughly half of whom were female. Over that period, the rate of new diagnoses rose by roughly 1%, with a similar pattern seen in adults of both sexes over the age of 55.Among those younger than 55, however, the rate of new pancreatic cancer diagnoses rose by 2.36% in women versus 0.62% in men.The difference was most pronounced in the youngest patients. Among women under age 34, the rate went up by 6.45%, compared to 2.97% in similarly aged men. The greatest increase in this age group was in Black women, the research team reported in Gastroenterology.Story continuesThe researchers also found that rates of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, an especially aggressive and deadly type of tumor at the head of the pancreas, appear to be increasing.The increases are small and the findings should not cause alarm, Gaddam said. The research team plans to look for explanations for these trends, which might include differences between pancreatic tumors in women and in men.The study was funded in part by The Widjaja Family Fund for Pancreatic Cancer Research.Cancer-killing virus tested in hard-to-treat breast cancerAdding a drug that contains a cancer cell-killing virus to treatment with chemotherapy yielded impressive results in a small trial of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, with nearly half seeing their tumors disappear.Triple-negative breast cancer has few treatment options because many drugs do not bind to the cancer cells and so cannot attack them. A new approach employs talimogene laherperepvec (T-VEC), sold as Imlygic by Amgen Inc, which contains a so-called oncolytic, or cancer-killing, herpes virus already in use for treating advanced melanoma.With funding from Amgen, researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida injected T-VEC directly into triple-negative breast cancer tumors in 37 patients receiving chemotherapy in advance of mastectomy or lumpectomy. The average tumor size was about four centimeters (1.65 inches), all the patients had stage 2 or stage 3 disease, and in nearly half, the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.As reported in Nature Medicine, the treatment led to a complete response in 46% of the patients, meaning the tumor was no longer detectable. Another 21% of the patients had significant shrinkage of their tumors.Two years after the treatment and the surgery, 89% of the patients remained cancer free, and there were no recurrences in the patients who had strong responses to the treatment.The researchers noted that Merck and Co's immunotherapy Keytruda is already approved for use along with chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer and has led to significantly improved survival, but with a risk for autoimmune side effects.Side effects with T-VEC were similar to what would be expected of chemotherapy. There were higher rates of low grade fevers, chills, headaches and injection site pain, researchers reported.""Locally administered agents like oncolytic viruses may boost tumor anti-immunity without increasing systemic toxicities,"" they said.If you can't kill MRSA, try disabling itInstead of trying to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, limiting the damage they can do might be an option, laboratory experiments suggest.""If we can disarm it, then we may not have to worry about it evading antimicrobial agents,"" study leader Seth Dickey of the University of Maryland said in a statement.There is a huge unmet need for new medicines or approaches to tackle bacteria resistant to many current drugs.Dickey's team has discovered that two proteins enable MRSA bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) to secrete the toxins that make people sick. They also learned how those proteins work and what happens if they are disabled, according to a report released on Tuesday and scheduled for publication this week in PNAS.""We were looking for an alternative way of approaching MRSA,"" Dickey said. ""We were interested in understanding how the bacterium causes disease to see if we could interfere directly with the virulence factors that the bug produces.""When they removed one of those proteins in test-tube experiments, toxins could not leave the single-cell organisms, the researchers found. Instead, the toxins merely built up inside the bacteria, where they cannot hurt anyone. When the other protein was removed, the bacteria were damaged by their own toxins.The researchers theorize that if therapies could be developed that target these two proteins, MRSA bacteria could be disabled, making them less deadly and possibly even harmless.The research, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has implications beyond MRSA because many other bacteria also have dual transport protein systems similar to the one found in MRSA.

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we expect CVX’s EPS to jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+45.8% vs. +14.2%).

Drug sales have been gaining and maintaining momentum.Label expansion of the existing drugs is likely to boost sales further in the days ahead. Ozempic is off to a solid start since its launch and will drive growth for the company. The launch of Rybelsus also looks impressive. The supply issues with Wegovy are resolved now.

117,42c15f97-b8d2-36f0-95d0-30f6a4e98550,PEG,2023-02-15,PSEG (PEG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pseg-peg-expected-beat-earnings-150003127.html,1676386803,STORY,['PEG'],"[The market expects PSEG (PEG) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.18 billion, down 28.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG?For PSEG, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that PSEG will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.86, delivering a surprise of +2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PSEG appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, NRG Energy (NRG), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.43 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +247.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $8.67 billion, up 23.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NRG has been revised 233.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NRG will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Our expectation is that some Russian oil will have to be shut in as a result.""The agency originally foresaw 3 million bpd of Russian oil being shut in after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.(Reporting by Noah Browning; editing by Jason Neely)]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corporation (CVX), Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Chevron have gained +25.1% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s gain of +27.3%. The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we expect CVX’s EPS to jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+45.8% vs. +14.2%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the market. Drug sales have been gaining and maintaining momentum.Label expansion of the existing drugs is likely to boost sales further in the days ahead. Ozempic is off to a solid start since its launch and will drive growth for the company. The launch of Rybelsus also looks impressive. The supply issues with Wegovy are resolved now. However, the patent expiry on some of the products in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio remains a woe.(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Amgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+8.6% vs. -7.7%). The company beat Q4 estimates for earnings and sales. While key drugs like Prolia, Repatha and Evenity are driving sales, increasing competition for its legacy products is hurting the same. Amgen is rapidly advancing its robust pipeline.The acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a strategic new growth asset, Tavneos, to Amgen’s portfolio. Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars portfolio with potential new products expected to drive long-term growth.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many of Amgen’s products including some biosimilars. Increasing biosimilar competition for some legacy products and weakness in key brands like Otezla and Lumakras, create potential revenue headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Starbucks Corporation (SBUX), General Dynamics Corporation (GD) and ResMed Inc.

128,5d69543e-1d0c-38ec-b661-dea3134ae74d,WYNN,2023-02-15,Here's Why Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-wynn-resorts-wynn-170005500.html,1676394005,STORY,['WYNN'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Wynn Resorts currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if WYNN is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this casino operator holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor WYNN, shares are up 5.52% over the past week while the Zacks Gaming industry is down 2.19% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.01% compares favorably with the industry's 3.67% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Wynn Resorts have risen 43.79%, and are up 18.9% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 4.08% and -4.79%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to WYNN's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. WYNN is currently averaging 2,518,686 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with WYNN.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost WYNN's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.48 to $0.24 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that WYNN is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Wynn Resorts on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.00.Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $2.04 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 billion.Shares of Zoetis were up in the pre-market trading session on Tuesday. The stock has fallen 13.8% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s 15.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly HighlightsZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.Revenues from the U.S. segment increased 7% year over year to $1.11 billion for the fourth quarter. Sales of companion animal products in this region grew 12% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of Simparica Trio, the triple-combination parasiticide for dogs. The Apoquel and Cytopoint brands in the dermatology portfolio also contributed to this increase. However, sales of livestock products decreased 6% year over year for the quarter due to a decrease in cattle product sales as a result of supply re-stocking in the third quarter of 2022 and generic competition for Draxxin.Sales of swine products declined year over year. Also, sales of poultry products declined for the quarter due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives of premium products in addition to generic competition.Revenues in the International segment were flat on a reported basis but increased 12% year over year on an operational basis to $901 million. Sales of companion animal products grew 7% on a reported and 21% on an operational basis. On a year-over-year basis, livestock product sales declined 7% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. While sales of poultry products increased because of market expansion in several key geographies, sales of swine products declined due to supply constraints.Story continuesThe growth resulted from increased sales of Zoetis’ parasiticides portfolio, including the Simparica and Revolution franchises, the key dermatology portfolio consisting of both Apoquel and Cytopoint brands as well as the recently launched chewable version of Apoquel. The company’s monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs and Solensiafor cats, also contributed to growth in the reported quarter. Growth of the company’s fish portfolio was driven primarily by increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile.Full-Year 2022 ResultsZoetis posted 2022 adjusted earnings of $4.88 per share (excluding one-time items), which increased from the year-ago figure of $4.70 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.87.Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $8.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.05 billion.2023 GuidanceZoetis issued its guidance for 2023.The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.34-$5.44 per share.Revenues are projected between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion.Our TakeZoetis exceeded fourth-quarter sales estimates, driven by the strong uptake of companion animal portfolio products, while earnings per share were at par with the estimates. ZTS expects to continue witnessing revenue growth, driven by the persistent strength of the pet care portfolio, key dermatology products, ongoing expansion in markets outside the United States and the acceleration of its diagnostics portfolio penetration.Zoetis Inc.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.LCNB (LCNB) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.51%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.51% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.56%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5%. Check LCNB (LCNB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;NRG Energy (NRG) is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.25% compared to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.13% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 7.69% over the past year. Check NRG Energy (NRG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.14 per share, RPT Realty (RPT) has a dividend yield of 4.92%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.42% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 8.33%. Check RPT Realty (RPT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 High Growth Utility Stocks to Buy. The US utilities industry in 2023 aims to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy or safe water to customers, but face challenges in balancing the energy equation due to pressure around decarbonization, cleaner energy adoption, electrification, infrastructure needs, and customer-driven disruption. The electric power sector faced both risks and opportunities in 2022. US electricity sales increased by 3.6% in the first eight months compared to the previous year, as the pandemic recovery progressed. However, costs rose significantly due to natural gas prices more than doubling, which was caused by global shortages worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires also continued to test the resilience of the regional power grids. To address these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked to increase reserves, deploy energy storage and microgrids, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance flexible load options. In 2023, despite the challenges faced by the US utilities industry, the emergence of new technologies and supportive policies could present opportunities and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.The Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, worth $430 billion, includes funding for tax credits and direct payments to promote the adoption of solar, wind, battery, and other energy sources and facilitate the transition of the electric power industry away from fossil fuels. Large American electric utility firms specializing in renewable power projects will be the biggest beneficiaries from the federal clean energy funding. Emily Beagle, research associate at Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that the location of utility companies will determine how much they stand to gain from the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar projects in sunnier states of the South and Southwest and wind projects in the Midwest are likely to gain the highest IRA budget, she said. Story continuesSome of the best utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

In Taiwan, TSMC shares opened down 3.3% as Asian markets started Wednesday trading.Depositary shares in TSMC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, have surged almost 32% this year, closing at $97.96 on Tuesday.""Berkshire made a small profit on TSMC. It was not a huge, huge win for Berkshire,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst. According to her calculations, Berkshire bought it for roughly $68.5 and sold for $74.5.It is rare but not unprecedented for Berkshire to quickly undo a multi-billion dollar investment in a company's stock. In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire sold nearly all of what had been an $8.3 billion stake in Verizon Communications Inc that it amassed in late 2020.TSMC last month said revenue in the first quarter is likely to dip 5% as it weathers a global downturn in the chip industry because of softening consumer demand for electronics. TSMC executives have said they do not expect market conditions to improve until the second half of the year.Besides TSMC, Buffett also divested 91.4% of its shares in US Bancorp, to 6.7 million shares, and shrunk its stake in BNY Mellon by roughly 60%, to 25.1 million shares. Both cuts totaled nearly $5.5 billion at current prices.Story continuesBuffett's conglomerate also holds shares in Citigroup Inc , Bank of America and Jefferies.Berkshire trimmed some positions across its portfolio of U.S. listed companies, including Chevron, Activision Blizzard, maker of the ""Call of Duty"" video game, and Kroger.Microsoft Corp is making efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. On Feb. 21, Microsoft will defend the deal in front of European Union and national antitrust officials at a closed hearing.Among Berkshire's few additions are Apple, which Buffett views more as a consumer products company. Berkshire bought another 20.8 million Apple shares worth $3.2 billion, raising its stake to 5.8%, according to the filing.Shares in Apple have surged nearly 18% this year.Berkshire also disclosed a new stake of $84 million in building materials company Louisiana-Pacific Corp.

Demand is the lowest in North America, signalling a persistent recession risk.Commenting on the latest results, Mike Jette, GEP's vice president of consulting, said: ""Though supplier capacity does remain somewhat stretched, we are much closer to normal operating conditions across the world's supply chains. The concern going forward is continuing weakness in demand, but it provides corporate procurement with significant leverage to secure better pricing and favorable terms.""The key findings from January's report:DEMAND: Global demand for components, raw materials, commodities and items companies require to provide goods and services remains subdued, resulting in low new order intakes at suppliers. Suppliers to North America continue to report the strongest drop in demand. In contrast, input demand across Asia is less suppressed following the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in China.INVENTORIES: Global business reports of safety stockpiling are back down as concerns over future supply and pricing ease.LABOR SHORTAGES: Labor shortages are having less of an adverse effect on supplier capacity.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Business reports of item shortages are at their lowest since October 2020 as global supply and demand forces rebalance.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs are normalizing as pressures on shipping, rail, air and road freight soften.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY: Europe remains the greatest pinch-point for suppliers. Supply chains connected to North America are the least stretched globally.Story continuesGEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index January 2023GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index January 2023Note: Full historic data going back to January 2005 is available; please contact economics@spglobal.com.About The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility IndexThe GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is produced by S&amp;P Global and GEP. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is derived from S&amp;P Global's PMI™ surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. These countries account for 89% of global gross domestic product (Source: World Bank World Development Indicators).The headline figure is the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. This a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators compiled by S&amp;P Global.The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is calculated using a weighted sum of the z-scores of the six indices. Weights are determined by analyzing the impact each component has on suppliers' delivery times through regression analysis.The six variables used are 1) JP Morgan Global Quantity of Purchases Index, 2) All Items Supply Shortages Indicator, 3) Transport Price Pressure Indicator, and Manufacturing PMI Comments Tracker data for 4) stockpiling due to supply or price concerns, and backlogs rising due to 5) staff shortages and 6) item shortages.A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the UK. The regional indices measure the performance of supply chains connected to those parts of the world.For more information on PMI surveys, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators, or the GEP Supply Chain Volatility Index methodologies, please contact economics@spglobal.com.About GEPGEP® delivers transformative supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and effectively, gain competitive advantage, boost profitability and increase shareholder value.

INTC, Synopsys, Inc. SNPS, FedEx Corp. FDX, First Solar, Inc. FSLR and Synchrony Financial SYF.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Intel, Synopsys and FedExThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Intel Corp., Synopsys, Inc. and FedEx Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Intel have underperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (-41.6% vs. -14.8%). The company is facing uncertainty over the over-supplied chip markets that are weighing on its near-term outlook. More than other players in the space, the market is skeptical of Intel's ability to profitably operate and execute in this unfavorable environment. In addition, production delays remain a concern for the company.Imposition of fresh lockdown restrictions in some markets, forex woes and high debt burden are other headwinds. It is witnessing intensifying competition in the server, networking and storage markets, while inflated raw material costs and signs of market saturation are worrisome. The Sino-US trade war is also adversely impacting its growth prospects.However, Intel is gaining rapid strides in the data center business with integrated solutions that are highly competitive in prices. The company is also focusing on developing a complete product range targeting different segments of the market.     (You can read the full research Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Synopsys shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+21.8% vs. -10.5%). The company is benefiting from strong design wins owing to a robust product portfolio. Growth in hybrid working trends is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for Synopsys' Fusion Compiler product boosted the top line.Growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects. Rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, internet of things and big data is driving investments in new computer and machine learning architectures. Our estimates suggest that Synopsys' revenues will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% through 2023-2025.However, Synopsys is hurting from supply-chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic. The company is also witnessing stiff competition. Geopolitical challenges coupled with uncertainties related to restrictions over trade with Huawei are other woes.(You can read the full research report on Synopsys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of FedEx have declined -8.4% over the past year against the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry's decline of -13.0%. The company's volumes are being hurt due to the decline in shipping demand, particularly in Asia and Europe. Weakening of e-commerce demand as economies re-open is another concern.To navigate the weaker-than-expected business environment, FDX is actively cutting costs. FedEx anticipates generating cost savings of nearly $3.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 estimate for capital expenditure has been slashed by $400 million to $5.9 billion.However, efforts to reward shareholders of FDX, through dividends and buybacks, are encouraging as well. In June 2022, FedEx raised its quarterly dividend by 53% to $1.15 per share. During fiscal 2022, FedEx repurchased shares worth $2.2 billion. FedEx's liquidity position is also impressive.(You can read the full research report on FedEx here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include First Solar, Inc. and Synchrony Financial.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The International Energy Agency boosted its forecast Wednesday for global oil demand this year as China reopens its economy, echoing OPEC’s tighter outlook from the day before. Meanwhile, a robust dollar was pressuring almost all commodities lower, capping bulls’ ability to break out.“The trajectory for demand is improving and for supply it is not,” said Josh Young, chief investment officer at Bison Interests. “China has been buying more physical oil in the last two weeks or so. Oil bears are taking it as a sign that China is gradually reopening.”Traders appeared to have shrugged off builds reported by the Energy Information Administration as they were accompanied by the highest-ever adjustment figure. That number indicates the difference between reported stockpiles and those implied by production, refinery demand, imports and exports. A large fluctuation from week to week raises questions among some traders about the accuracy of the figures.Despite the daily gyrations, crude is still stuck in a $10 band this year, caught between the risk of a recession hitting world governments and continued optimism surrounding Chinese demand. Smaller, macro-related fluctuations have moved prices up and down, but prices remain in the narrow band as the market remains fairly balanced until either a slow down or China’s reopening comes into full force.Story continues--With assistance from Chunzi Xu.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsAiming to Be the Next Emirates, Air India Makes Record Jet BuyWhat Happens When a Company Sues Itself?The World’s War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionChina’s ‘Zero-Dollar’ Tourists Are Getting a Cautious Welcome©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""Our expectation is that some Russian oil will have to be shut in as a result.""The agency originally foresaw 3 million bpd of Russian oil being shut in after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.(Reporting by Noah Browning; editing by Jason Neely)]"

Here are three 5G stocks to buy for the future of connectivity.QCOMQualcomm$131AMTAmerican Tower$217AVGOBroadcom$5995G Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comBased in San Diego, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) makes the semiconductors and software that are critical to 5G networks and the mobile phones that run on them. The company forms a major part of America’s wireless backbone. And its technology has never been more in demand than now. That helps to explain why QCOM stock is up over 20% so far in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut even with this year’s sharp increase, QCOM stock still has a moderate price-earnings ratio of 12.5, which is low for a tech company of Qualcomm’s size. And the stock pays a quarterly dividend  yield of 2.3%, which is high for a tech stock.Qualcomm is facing a cyclical slowdown right now in mobile-phone sales, and it continues to grapple with supply-chain constraints. As a result, the company reported disappointing earnings recently, with its revenue falling 12% year-over-year to $9.46 billion, and its net income declining 27% to $2.68 billion or $2.37 per share. But over the long term, QCOM stock will remain a reliable winner and one of the best ways for investors to play the 5G boom.Story continuesAmerican Tower (AMT)Multiple hands holding up their cell phonesSource: ShutterstockSpeaking of companies whose infrastructure is critical to 5G networks, how about Boston-based American Tower (NYSE:AMT)?  A real estate investment trust (REIT), American Tower owns and operates the towers on which 5G signals are broadcast, not only in the U.S. but all over the world, from Latin America to Europe and Asia. Currently, the company owns and operates more than 200,000 communications sites globally, including more than 40,000 towers and sites in the U.S. and neighboring Canada.AMT stock has performed well over the past few years and has a track record of consistently generating higher returns than the market.This year, the stock is up 2.6%, and it is down 7% over the past year. The stock is a little pricey with a P/E ratio of 34.4, but it does offer shareholders a chunky quarterly dividend  yield of 2.7%. In fact, American Tower has raised its dividend for 44 straight quarters, increasing the quarterly payout by 643% over an 11-year period.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comAnother semiconductor and microchip company whose products are important components of broadband and wireless networks is California-based Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). A going concern since 1961, Broadcom tends to get less attention in the business press than some newer semiconductor companies. However, AVGO has performed well over the long term for shareholders who have stuck with the company.In 2023, AVGO stock is up 7%. The stock has gained 16% over the past 12-months, when many of its peers’ share prices fell more than 30%.Like the other names on this list, Broadcom has a high quarterly dividend  yield, as its yield is now 3.10%. Its P/E ratio looks decent at 22.8, indicating that Broadcom’s stock is not overvalued at its current levels.AVGO stock did retreat recently on reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to stop using its chips in favor of its own semiconductors and microchips. But not to worry; Broadcom will adapt and be just fine over the long haul.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

Airbnb expects the number of nights and experiences booked to grow at close to the same 20% pace of the fourth quarter. The company said Tuesday that comparisons of the current quarter with the same period in 2022 are easier due to the impact of the omicron variant and war in Ukraine that weighed on business at this time last year.Shares of Airbnb have rallied more than 57% this year, outpacing fellow online travel giant Expedia Group Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc., which have increased more than 32% and 23%, respectively. TripAdvisor Inc. also rallied as much as 8.6% Wednesday following a favorable earnings report the day before.Demand is remaining resilient so far this year, with travelers broadly booking trips further in advance, Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson said on a call with analysts.“Those travel-crazy Europeans are booking Summer travel earlier this year,” Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients.The optimistic outlook followed what was already a robust performance in 2022. Airbnb said it had net income of $1.9 billion, marking its first profitable full year according to generally accepted accounting principles. In the fourth quarter, Airbnb reported revenue increased 24% to $1.9 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.86 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share were 48 cents.Story continuesAirbnb has been a major beneficiary of the work and lifestyle changes wrought by the pandemic. The company recorded its highest revenue and most profitable quarter ever in the period from July to September, fueled by pent-up travel demand after two years of Covid-19 restrictions.Now, it’s starting to see some of the trends it benefitted from — such as people renting large rural homes for weeks or months at a time — reverse and travelers opt for shorter stays in big cities and more international destinations. High airline prices and a potential looming economic slowdown are also adding to consumers’ considerations when weighing a trip. But it doesn’t seem to be putting off travelers yet, as the company said “consumer confidence to travel remains high.”Airbnb’s results follow Expedia, which was also upbeat about the current quarter and said lodging bookings in January grew 20% over pre-pandemic 2019. Expedia however, delivered disappointing revenue and profit in the fourth quarter as a result of Hurricane Ian and winter storms in December.Airbnb reported 88.2 million nights and experiences booked in the three months ended Dec. 31, a 20% increase from a year earlier but missing the average analyst estimate of 90.1 million. Airbnb said the quarter had its highest number of active bookers yet, “demonstrating guests’ excitement to travel on Airbnb despite evolving macroeconomic uncertainties.”More hosts are joining the platform, too. Excluding listings from China, the company ended last year with 6.6 million active listings, an increase of 900,000 compared with 2021. Airbnb has worked to add more housing supply, rolling out features and tools that make it easier for new hosts to list their homes.“Despite macro volatility, demand remains robust and guests are booking longer stays” further in advance, creating a “strong backlog,” JPMorgan Securities analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note.It also partnered with large apartment landlords that allow their tenants to sublet their apartments, and who then receive a cut from the booking.“I think this is a program that’s going to grow quite a lot,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said on the call, adding that it’s a strategic move for the company to develop relationships with some of the biggest landlords in the US.Long-term stays, or those lasting 28 days or more, accounted for 21% of gross nights booked in the fourth quarter, about the same as in the same period a year ago. Those type of stays became popular during the pandemic as workers found new flexibility to work remotely, often seeking out locations in small towns and mountains. Gross nights booked in high-density urban areas, traditionally the strongest part of Airbnb’s business, increased 22% in the fourth quarter. Airbnb also said it saw cross-border travel to all regions increase from a year earlier.A shift back to more urban destinations also often means a lower average daily rate than the whole-home rentals popularized during the pandemic. The company said it expects average daily rates in the first quarter to be softer than last year, a trend that will continue for the remainder of 2023. Part of that trend can be attributed to the company’s pricing transparency and discounts, Airbnb said, which it expects to drive “greater affordability for guests.”(Updated to include share move in the lede, TripAdvisor details and analyst commentary from fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious CopsZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 YearsThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on AmmunitionHow to Make Sure Your Resume Isn’t Overlooked — Without LyingFear Made John McAfee Rich.

158,b1b50534-8eb1-3d49-afad-699371b17922,EXPE,2023-02-15,"Expedia’s 3 Core Brands, Explained",Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-3-core-brands-explained-073000268.html,1676446200,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Expedia Group has 10 consumer brands, but its marketing strategy shifted starting in late 2021 to emphasize three core brands above all others: Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo.That’s one of several interesting takeaways from Expedia Group’s 2022 10-K financial report, which was published Friday.It’s Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo … and the Seldom MentionedExpedia Group considers Expedia the full-service travel brand as it offers stays, flights, car rentals, packages, things to do, and cruises.The company looks at Hotels.com as the singly focused lodging marketer with its hotels, homes, apartments, villas, and hostels.Vrbo is the whole homes vacation rental brand.In addition to their main U.S. market, these three brands have localized websites around the world, although most of Expedia Group’s revenue in 2022 came from the U.S. (See more below.)In the financial filing, Expedia Group stated: “While we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands, we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands: Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo.”That’s a shift from the company’s 2021 10-K, which cites the Group’s “extensive portfolio of consumer brands.”The other still-running but now de-emphasized consumer brands include Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire.com, and CarRentals.com.In 2018, Skift did an explainer on Expedia Group’s then far-flung 23 brands, including consumer and business-to-business brands. The company has shed several of those brands since Peter Kern became CEO in 2020, namely Egencia, SilverRail, Classic Vacations, Alice, and others.Under the prior Expedia Group leadership of Dara Khosrowshahi and Mark Okerstrom, many of Expedia Group’s consumer brands had their own marketing teams that sometimes competed against one another, but under Kern the marketing employees now work in unison, or at least that’s the way officials tell it.Story continuesThe idea is that focusing on the three core consumer brands would reap greater results than a more scattershot approach.So witness the fact that Vrbo made a return appearance with a Super Bowl spot on Sunday, iSpot.tv estimated that Expedia.com was the third-highest advertising spender on U.S. national TV during the first 11 months of 2022, and Hotels.com kicked off a new ad campaign, Find Your Perfect Somewhere last year, and refreshed it in January.In video and TV formats, at least, Orbitz and Hotwire haven’t debuted new spots since 2021.It will be interesting to see how the emphasis on Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo and the playing down of the Orbitz brand will mesh with Expedia Group’s pending launch of a consolidated loyalty program, One Key, which was to combine the Expedia, Hotels.com and Orbitz loyalty programs into one plan, and expand it to Vrbo, as well.Why hype Orbitz’s inclusion into the new loyalty program when the company won’t be marketing Orbitz as a core brand?Vrbo Didn’t Boost Its Property Numbers in 2022Expedia Group reported that it added 25,000 hotels to its stockpile of lodging offerings in 2022, bringing its total count of accommodations to 3 million available, but Vrbo’s contribution remained relatively stagnant at “over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings.”For 2021, Expedia Group likewise reported roughly 3 million properties available, with more than 2 million of them being alternative accommodations.Asked about Vrbo’s seeming lack of expansion in its property numbers, an Expedia Group spokesperson stated: “Vrbo is focused on quality, not the quantity of places for travelers to stay together. It’s more important to us that families and groups of friends have the best selection of private, whole home accommodation in the most popular vacation destinations with great amenities. Last year, Vrbo experienced the highest ever property adds in the U.S. and has superior inventory in beach and resort markets.”It’s unclear whether a Vrbo technology migration into the Expedia brand platform’s front end that started in 2022 played any role in its property numbers. That transition that will continue well into 2023.Meanwhile, Airbnb stated Tuesday night that its current 6.6 million global active listings amount to 900,000 more than what it had at the beginning of 2022 when excluding the listings it had in China before dropping out of that domestic market.Incidentally, Expedia Group has been working on a wide assortment of tech platform migrations off and on for way more than a decade. You can look at that several ways: Either the company should be lauded for constantly seeking to improve its technology and efficiencies, sometimes in the wake of acquisitions, or perhaps some of these earlier protracted efforts just didn’t stick.Expedia Got More Global in 2022Expedia Group took in 66 percent of its revenue from the U.S. in 2022 and 34 percent from the rest of the world, which was another takeaway from its annual financial filing.In contrast, in 2021, when Europe was still facing Covid-related shutdowns for part of the year, Expedia Group derived more of its revenue from the U.S., namely 76 percent. That meant only 24 percent came from beyond U.S. borders.In pre-Covid 2019, when international borders, including China, were passable, Expedia Group’s revenue split was 56 percent U.S. versus 44 percent international.So Expedia Group was considerably more of a global company in 2019 than it is today. China’s expected reopening in 2023 should help Expedia Group a tad with international expansion. The company has a partnership with Trip.com Group on outbound China travel, but that’s not a significant portion of Expedia Group’s business.versus loyalty consolidationGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

If you want to see more most profitable utility stocks now, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now.In this article, we discuss utility companies in the United States.Utility companies provide essential services such as electricity, natural gas, and water.Given how essential the services are, many utility companies in the U.S. are regulated by the government in the United States. In exchange for providing services, many regulated utilities can get a return on their rate base decided by regulators.Sometimes the return on their rate base is better than expected. Sometimes the return on their rate base is worse than expected.S&amp;P Global explains rate base,A utility's rate base is essentially the company's ""prudent"" capital investment, as determined by the applicable regulatory authority’s net of accumulated depreciation. Stated differently, it is the net asset base from which the utility provides electric, gas or water service, and upon which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, usually the company's weighted average cost of capital. Thus, the rate base value is a key variable in the determination of a utility's revenue requirement.While there are many utilities that are regulated in the United States, there are also many deregulated utilities or unregulated utilities in the United States that don't get a return on their rate base, however, as competition ultimately decides how well they do.Regulations are also different in countries outside of the United States as every country is different in terms of how they regulate their utilities.Renewable EnergyGiven the need to invest in new renewable energy infrastructure to meet emission regulations, some leading regulated utilities have increased their rate base as a result. The increase in their rate base has allowed them to increase earnings.In terms of green energy, electric utility companies have also faced more competition as rooftop solar adoption has increased and increasing heat pumps adoption has also represented competition for natural gas companies. The effect of the competition is different for each utility, however, depending on whether a utility is regulated or deregulated, the effect of the regulations, and many other factors. In the long term, utilities may need to innovate to adjust to the changes. In the near term, however, many of the leading regulated utilities do have EPS growth potential if regulators allow them to grow their earnings.Story continuesAlthough leading regulated utility companies do have earnings growth potential in the near term, events like wildfires like what occurred to PG&amp;E could affect the utility's value and the industry does face more competition in the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in 2022. As a result, U.S. treasury yields have increased considerably and substantial capital has moved from leading equities into the U.S. Treasury market. The capital outflow has decreased valuations for many stocks including many utilities.michaeljung/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now, we took the 15 most valuable utilities in the United States by market capitalization and we ranked them by the amount of net income (TTM) they had according to YCharts.Of the 15, we took the top 12.Because some companies have not posted their earnings results for Q4, the trailing twelve months for different companies might not be the same time frames as some could end in September 30 and some could end in December 31. Because we used YCharts data, the net income might not be adjusted income either.12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now12. American Water Works Company, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

166,cb2f1b98-738e-35d5-9964-d51098f89f97,JNJ,2023-02-15,UPDATE 2-Judge indicates intention to dismiss J&J talc unit bankruptcy,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-judge-indicates-intention-dismiss-160415181.html,1676390655,STORY,['JNJ'],"[(Adds bankruptcy judge's ruling allowing a talc case to proceed)By Mike SpectorFeb 14 (Reuters) - The bankruptcy case filed by Johnson &amp; Johnson's subsidiary shouldering talc-related lawsuits will soon be dismissed unless a U.S appeals court agrees to reconsider its decision to nix the company's attempt to offload the litigation into Chapter 11 proceedings, a federal judge said on Tuesday.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan said during a hearing in Trenton, New Jersey that he intends to toss the Chapter 11 case once the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issues a formal mandate to carry out a Jan. 30 ruling by a three-judge panel to dismiss the matter.The 3rd Circuit panel ruled that the J&amp;J subsidiary, called LTL Management, had no legitimate claim to Chapter 11 protection because it did not face financial distress.The dismissal is on hold since LTL asked the full 3rd Circuit late on Monday to reconsider the panel's decision. Should the 3rd Circuit deny that request, Kaplan could dismiss the case within days.""It is my intent, when the mandate is issued, to issue an order dismissing the case,"" Kaplan said during Tuesday's hearing.Should the 3rd Circuit refuse a rehearing, LTL could seek to further delay the bankruptcy's dismissal, including potentially at the U.S. Supreme Court, a lawyer for the J&amp;J subsidiary, Greg Gordon, told the hearing.Absent a reversal, the 3rd Circuit's decision would force J&amp;J back into trial courts to battle nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging the company's Baby Powder and other cosmetic products containing talc cause cancer. Gordon told the judge that LTL was engaged in a ""Herculean effort to get the defense team back in place"" to manage cases in trial courts should Kaplan ultimately dismiss the bankruptcy.J&amp;J maintains its talc products are safe.LTL's bankruptcy had put the deluge of talc cases on hold. Kaplan on Tuesday granted a 24-year-old plaintiff's request to allow his case to proceed in California in the wake of the 3rd Circuit's decision.Story continues""The pendulum has swung,"" Kaplan said, ruling that a trial for the terminally ill plaintiff should no longer be indefinitely halted on grounds that it could threaten LTL's bankruptcy reorganization.Kaplan said other cases would remain paused in the short term while LTL's appeals process unfolds.The 3rd Circuit decision more broadly cast a cloud over J&amp;J's use of a maneuver known as the Texas two-step, named for a Texas law the company employed to carve its consumer business into two new subsidiaries.In October 2021, J&amp;J offloaded the tidal wave of talc lawsuits it faced onto one of its newly created units, LTL, which then declared bankruptcy. Reuters last year detailed the secret planning of Texas two-steps by Johnson &amp; Johnson and other major firms in a series of reports exploring corporate attempts to evade lawsuits through bankruptcies.J&amp;J, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion, has argued that the avalanche of lawsuits posed a serious financial threat. The company's costs of verdicts, settlements and legal fees soared to about $4.5 billion, with no end in sight, according to bankruptcy-court filings.The 3rd Circuit's reasoning underscored what some legal experts call an inherent contradiction: bankruptcies being executed by multinational firms worth billions of dollars that were in little danger of running out of money to pay plaintiff-creditors.LTL declared bankruptcy while J&amp;J avoided seeking Chapter 11 protection, with all its inherent financial and reputational wreckage.J&amp;J said it generously financed LTL to ensure a fair settlement - better, the company and its subsidiary argued, than trial courts where some plaintiffs receive outsized payments while others receive little or nothing.The 3rd Circuit found that J&amp;J's funding of the subsidiary, initially $2 billion and perhaps eventually more, undercut any claim of financial peril necessary to justify LTL's bankruptcy filing. In a petition seeking a rehearing filed Monday, a lawyer for LTL, Neal Katyal, called that reasoning ""upside-down.""A 2018 Reuters investigation found that J&amp;J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, was present in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company said in May 2020 it would stop selling talc-based Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the product. The company later decided to stop selling talc-based Baby Powder globally starting this year. J&amp;J has denied its talc contains asbestos.(Reporting by Mike Spector in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)]"
167,87ac9bb1-62ab-35ab-9a77-ef0578e3cec6,JNJ,2023-02-15,Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-jnj-attracting-investor-140002195.html,1676383202,STORY,['JNJ'],"[Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -6.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Johnson &amp; Johnson falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share, indicating a change of -6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.94 indicates a change of +4.1% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate of $23.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.7%. The $97.73 billion and $100.68 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.9% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.4%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $2.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +5.86%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RSG may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Republic Services is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for RSG in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.10 per share for RSG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for RSG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.50% heading into earnings season.Republic Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRepublic Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRepublic Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Republic Services, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that RSG has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Republic Services, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

174,e756ca61-e7c4-3ffa-92d1-d4b1f1d9b2ad,MOS,2023-02-15,The Mosaic Company (MOS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-company-mos-attracting-investor-140002495.html,1676383202,STORY,['MOS'],"[Mosaic (MOS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which Mosaic belongs, has gained 6.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share, indicating a change of +6.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +126%. This estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.96 indicates a change of -21.3% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Mosaic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.31 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $18.95 billion and $16.46 billion estimates indicate +53.4% and -13.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.5%. EPS of $3.22 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -11.01%. The EPS surprise was -8.52%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Mosaic. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Tata Group, which regained control of Air India last year after decades of public ownership, put out just six paragraphs.Its low-key announcement illustrates a rising breed of private airline owners transforming a financially-risky Indian airline sector, alongside the publicity-shy founders of IndiGo.The deal was in the making for over a year, insiders said, recounting details of the process on condition of anonymity.Serious talks began last summer and continued until days before Christmas when outlines were agreed. As the astonishing scale of the deal began to crystallise, Reuters reported in December the parties were nearing a record 500-plane agreement.The epicentre of dealmaking was St James' Court - a luxury Victorian hotel near Buckingham Palace in London's West End.In the hothouse atmosphere of a classic aircraft industry negotiating ritual known as a ""bake-off"", negotiators from the airline, planemakers and engine giants camped out at the Tata-owned hotel and neighbouring suites for days at a stretch.Story continuesThey were chasing a bigger slice of a fast-growing market that has seen many airline growth plans rise and fall.Now, Boeing had a chance to restore its position in India's single-aisle jet market and narrow Airbus' large lead. Airbus wanted a bigger piece of the wide-body market led by its rival. With bulging order books, neither could sweep the whole order.At stake was India's bid to win back the custom of visitors and its own diaspora from highly efficient Gulf carriers. Politics set the context but talks were commercial - and tough.""The convergence of the political will of the country to regain sovereignty of international connectivity, combined with the ambition of the mighty Tata ... if things are done right it has all the ingredients to be really solid,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told Reuters on Tuesday.'METHODICAL, TOUGH'The contest for attention played out across London on a chilly day in December as Airbus found itself in talks with Air India on one side of the capital, while fighting Qatar Airways in court over the fate of similar A350 jets just two miles away.Airbus and Qatar Airways later settled their contractual and safety row, but Air India jumped ahead of Qatar in the queue for smaller jets though sources say the Gulf airline also won hefty damages.Negotiations led by Air India's chief commercial and transformation officer, Nipun Aggarwal, and Yogesh Agarwal, head of aircraft acquisitions, often stretched into the night with sellers churning out new ""best offers"" fuelled by room service.""Air India negotiated hard and the team is very sharp despite having no prior aviation experience. They compare with some of the best dealmakers in the business,"" one person said.A second person who watched the billions fall into place said the Air India negotiators were ""methodical, tough and very sophisticated"".The London negotiations ended with a dinner at the hotel's Michelin-starred Indian restaurant Quilon, renowned for its seafood and coastal cuisine from places like Goa and Kerala.While the major focus in any jet deal is the battle between planemakers, engines are often key and can speed or hold up the wider deal. Plans for announcements on the anniversary of Tata's Air India takeover slipped as engine talks wore on.The biggest overall winner, insiders say, is General Electric which picks up the lion's share of the lucrative engine deals, with its CFM joint-venture with Safran beating Raytheon-owned rival Pratt &amp; Whitney on Airbus A320neos. Rolls-Royce also got a boost from the sale of 40 Airbus A350s.Highlighting the long road to strategic deals in aviation, GE's victory had been in the making for about 10 years.In 2014, it won a tender for 27 engines for Air India A320s. Soon after it convinced Vistara to take on its engines for seven aircraft which later translated into an order for 70 planes. The turning point was IndiGo, which switched from Pratt &amp; Whitney after technical issues that Pratt says have been resolved.Analysts caution many obstacles remain to Air India's plans. It needs better service and efficiency to make a serious dent in the powerfully entrenched hubs of Doha and Dubai.But India's potential will continue to lure dealmakers.

That being said, Booking remains very well-positioned to continue to be the leader of the online travel agency sector during that time.With hundreds of millions of more citizens in China, India, and many other developing countries reaching middle-class status, enabling them to embark on international travel,  BKNG has a great deal of room to grow in the coming decades.In an indication of the growing strength of the global travel market, British bank Barclays in Nov. estimated that the global leisure travel sector would expand 12% this year. Also noteworthy is that the fund controlled by George Soros, who’s generally a very savvy investor, made BKNG stock its second largest new buy in the third quarter of last year.Fortinet (FTNT)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) has clearly become a leader within the cybersecurity sector.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 High Growth Utility Stocks to Buy. The US utilities industry in 2023 aims to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy or safe water to customers, but face challenges in balancing the energy equation due to pressure around decarbonization, cleaner energy adoption, electrification, infrastructure needs, and customer-driven disruption. The electric power sector faced both risks and opportunities in 2022. US electricity sales increased by 3.6% in the first eight months compared to the previous year, as the pandemic recovery progressed. However, costs rose significantly due to natural gas prices more than doubling, which was caused by global shortages worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires also continued to test the resilience of the regional power grids. To address these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked to increase reserves, deploy energy storage and microgrids, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance flexible load options. In 2023, despite the challenges faced by the US utilities industry, the emergence of new technologies and supportive policies could present opportunities and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.The Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, worth $430 billion, includes funding for tax credits and direct payments to promote the adoption of solar, wind, battery, and other energy sources and facilitate the transition of the electric power industry away from fossil fuels. Large American electric utility firms specializing in renewable power projects will be the biggest beneficiaries from the federal clean energy funding. Emily Beagle, research associate at Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that the location of utility companies will determine how much they stand to gain from the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar projects in sunnier states of the South and Southwest and wind projects in the Midwest are likely to gain the highest IRA budget, she said. Story continuesSome of the best utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

188,8d198b86-819b-3d30-9184-8246ff84c8f9,SO,2023-02-15,Southern Company (SO) Q4 Earnings on Deck: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-q4-earnings-deck-133601822.html,1676381761,STORY,"['SO', 'NIMC']","[The Southern Company SO is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 16. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 24 cents per share on revenues of $6.1 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider missed the consensus mark due to a spike in operations and maintenance costs. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. However, revenues of $8.4 billion came in 24.1% above the consensus mark, backed by the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, and a demand boost from favorable weather.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Southern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 33.3% decrease year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 5.7% improvement from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added nearly 11,000 new residential electric customers and more than 8,000 residential natural gas customers in the third quarter. This trend most likely continued in the October-December period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the third quarter increased 37% year over year to $6.2 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

190,00a4596c-c98c-3fbd-a698-cbb8617ebf59,CI,2023-02-15,Cigna Corporation (CI) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporation-ci-trending-stock-140002627.html,1676383202,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this health insurer have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $5.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.80 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.6%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.26 indicates a change of +14% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cigna is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $45.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.6%. The $186.99 billion and $225.16 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.5% and +20.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $45.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.2%. EPS of $4.96 for the same period compares with $4.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +2.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of the market's current condition, you can go directly to see Jim Cramer's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023.According to a CNBC article published this February, Cramer believes that the Federal Reserve was inching closer to beating inflation, despite what Wall Street thinks. The US economy has been in a state of downturn, making the market highly vulnerable and investors more cautious about investing in new companies.Cramer has still named stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the options investors should consider for their portfolios this year, considering his own optimism regarding the market. He has added that price stability is just around the corner, and while some weaker companies will most likely never be able to recover, high-end companies will manage to survive.While the Federal Reserve does not seem to be relenting entirely when it comes to interest rates, the hikes have gotten smaller.Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023Let's now take a look at Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 stocks that have been named by Jim Cramer on CNBC's Mad Money this January as his top picks for 2023. We have also mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks, ensuring they are positive. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 202310. Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is an industrial machinery company based in New Britain, Connecticut. It operates in the US, Canada, the rest of the Americas, France, the rest of Europe, and Asia. The company offers products like professional-grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment.On February 5, Barclay analyst Julian Mitchell reiterated an Overweight rating on Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) shares.Story continuesThis January, Jim Cramer recommended that investors should start a small position in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in 2023 and gradually buy more. He believes that the stock will continue to see gains in 2023 after its performance last year. Revenues for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) have increased by almost 70% over the past ten years. The stock's most attractive quality, however, is its status as a dividend king, with a record of 55 years of dividend increases. It has a yield of 3.59% as of February 14.Greenhaven Associates was the largest stakeholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in the fourth quarter, holding 1.3 million shares. In the third quarter, 26 hedge funds were long the stock, with a total stake value of $447 million.Ariel Investments, an investment management company, mentioned Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), is among Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.9. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) is a utility company based in Columbus, Ohio. The company engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for sale in the US.Neil Kalton at Wells Fargo holds an Equal Weight rating on American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) shares as of February 1.In January, Cramer named American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) as one of the stocks he believes to be a worthwhile addition to investors' portfolios.

The company designs and manufactures aircraft systems in the US and internationally. It also offers unmanned autonomous aircraft systems.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shares on February 6 by Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle.Jim Cramer this January commented that Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could be the best defense contracted to own as the Russo-Ukrainian war persists. In the fourth quarter, the company had robust sales growth of 16% year-over-year.

Here's what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Here's what the firm said:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Shares have been on an impressive trajectory recently, outpacing the notable move in the overall oilfield services and equipment group. Halliburton benefits from the ongoing upswing in global upstream spending and should play a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate the recent productivity declines in North American shale. The tight services and equipment market has resulted in strong pricing gains and margin expansion, and when coupled with a disciplined approach to capital spending, has paved the way for the stock’s outperformance.”6۔ McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a healthcare company based in Irving, Texas.

201,97c286cf-ccb8-3de7-a424-5ed360785a5f,PFE,2023-02-15,Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ray-dalio-stock-portfolio-top-173110973.html,1676395870,STORY,"['ABT', 'COST', 'MDLZ', 'MCD', 'PFE', 'PDD', 'V', 'PEP', 'CL', 'SBUX', 'PG', 'JNJ']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

""Freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported, and not rooted in sound financial analysis.""Giuliani's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.Smartmatic has said it provided election technology only to Los Angeles County, which Biden won.Story continues""We look forward to holding Fox News and the other defendants accountable in court,"" its lawyer J. Erik Connolly said.Tuesday's decision upheld much of a March 2022 ruling by state Supreme Court Justice David Cohen.Another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, is pursuing a similar $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News in Delaware.The case is Smartmatic USA Corp et al v Fox Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 2022-01291.

Here's a quick peek.[FRANK TURNER, ""I STILL BELIEVE""](SINGING) And I still believe.- Well, if seeing is believing, I believe we've been seeing.SEANA SMITH: There we go. Lots of fans have been waiting quite some time for that. The third season of ""Ted Lasso"" starts streaming on Apple TV+ on March 15, just about a month away. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal is here with us. Allie, lots of people are excited. The person to the right of me is very excited for this. What can we expect?ALLIE CANAL: Oh, yes, and I've had multiple people over the past year, year and a half, come up to me and say, do you know when ""Ted Lasso"" comes out?DAVE BRIGGS: 17 months, man.ALLIE CANAL: I know. October 2021--DAVE BRIGGS: Geez.ALLIE CANAL: --was when we last saw this show. And finally, it is back. It's going to be released on Wednesday, March 15, as you said. First three episodes available on that premiere day and then will be released once a week on Wednesdays this time. The last time we saw the show, they released it on Fridays.So it's the first Apple TV series to premiere and debut mid-week, but it's just one of those shows that it's adored by fans. It's adored by critics. It won multiple Emmys for Best Comedy, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress. So I think fans are just excited to finally see this show return. But Seana, as you and I were talking about, sometimes, it takes too long for these shows--SEANA SMITH: Yes, way too long.ALLIE CANAL: --especially with the binge model. You binge it all, and then all of a sudden, you don't get a new season for two years. And you forget everything that happened in the seasons prior. So I'm on YouTube, trying to look up the synopsis of what happened the past two seasons. And I do think that's sort of risky. And you could lose some viewers that way.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: With the ""Shrinking"" show, this will be my two favorite shows on TV, both on Apple TV.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVE BRIGGS: Because ""Shrinking"" and ""Ted Lasso,"" terrific. They are out of the gate. Speaking of Apple, they had the halftime show. We have some fresh numbers from the Super Bowl and the Apple Music halftime show. How many tuned in?ALLIE CANAL: So for the Super Bowl-- and I, unfortunately, am an Eagles fan, so I watched the whole game, loved the whole game up until the very last minute. But I was not alone. 113 million folks tuned in to watch this game, the third biggest TV program of all time, behind the 2017 and 2015 Super Bowls. But it really was that halftime show with Rihanna that gathered the most viewers. Nearly 119 million people tuned in to watch this, the second highest rated halftime show right behind Katy Perry. I'm curious to hear your guys' thoughts on what you thought of Rihanna and her performance.SEANA SMITH: So I liked it. I love a lot of her songs. I thought it met some of the hype out there. To be honest, I didn't love it. It was far from my favorite halftime show.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm so relieved to hear you say that because Rihanna fans will come for you, man.SEANA SMITH: Oh, I know.DAVE BRIGGS: They are--ALLIE CANAL: And they already have. There's already TikToks saying--DAVE BRIGGS: I thought it was--ALLIE CANAL: --she was pregnant, this and that. And it's--SEANA SMITH: Certainly drummed up a lot-- yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: She was pregnant. That's what I saw.SEANA SMITH: That's amazing.DAVE BRIGGS: It was a very average performance. It was very obvious she was lip syncing everything. I don't know. I was not moved by it, other than the fact that she plugged her company. I thought it was just OK.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and I read a headline saying that instead of chaos, she chose to be very sleek and simple, in some ways. I can respect that because I do think the halftime show has become this spectacle. But I was disappointed that there were no guest performers. That's like one of the things missing.DAVE BRIGGS: Yes, there was. It was her unborn child.ALLIE CANAL: Well, if you count her unborn child. But I mean, she has so many great performers that have been featured on her songs. I was expecting that. I was expecting a little bit more. And again, like you said, Dave, I know people are going to come for me for that because they are very protective. And I love Rihanna. Don't get me wrong. She looked amazing. The few times that I did hear her sing, like, she sounds amazing. I hope that comes with a tour or something soon, but for now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but you also got to give her a lot of credit. When I was pregnant-- I've been pregnant twice.ALLIE CANAL: Absolutely.SEANA SMITH: I wouldn't be getting up on one of those things suspended all the way in the air, let alone performing--DAVE BRIGGS: No doubt.SEANA SMITH: --in front of more than 100 million people. So, in that regard--ALLIE CANAL: And what a way, what a way to announce your pregnancy.SEANA SMITH: Oh, my God.ALLIE CANAL: So I mean--SEANA SMITH: Incredible.ALLIE CANAL: --it is iconic in that way.SEANA SMITH: Certainly is.DAVE BRIGGS: No doubt.]"

Tubi's new research highlights the explosive growth in Connected TV (CTV) ad spend, while ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) services lead the streaming pack as consumers look to cut subscription costs in the year ahead.""As subscription costs continue to rise, nearly 1 in 3 streamers plan to reduce spending on streaming services this year,"" said Mark Rotblat, Chief Revenue Officer, Tubi. ""With consumers turning to AVOD to complement the select SVOD services they choose to keep, Tubi offers a brand-safe environment for advertisers looking to tap into an incremental, young, diverse, and highly engaged streaming audience.""Tubi's Total Viewing Time (TVT) is up 44% year-over-year (2022 calendar year vs 2021), with more than 5 billion hours streamed in 2022, and the platform audience has grown surpassing 64 million monthly active users. Tubi's audience continues to be young and increasingly diverse, African American and LGBT audiences grew over 50% in 2022, and audience growth exceeded 25% in each major level of household income and the Hispanic demo - according to MRI. Additionally, Tubi's core younger demographic remains strong - more than 1 in 3 (36%) Tubi streamers are between the ages of 18 and 34. Tubi is proud to offer consumers free access to more than 50,000 titles from 455 content partners as well as a growing curated FAST offering watched by  1 in 5 AVOD streamers in the past 12 months.The full report can be downloaded here and highlights are below:Story continuesKey Industry Trends: Cord cutting continues and CTV ad spend is on the rise: 3 out of 4 consumers agree that AVODs are a practical alternative to cable and satellite TV. As CTV advertising continues to grow, funding isn't just coming from linear budgets - this year significant digital video, social media, OOH, and traditional media dollars shifted to CTV.SVODs curbing password sharing may increase churn: 35% of streamers access other people's digital video streaming services and 45% of streamers want to stream without having an account. SVODs aim to curb these losses by charging accounts shared across multiple households, which is expected to increase churn.Effective content and recommendations drive viewer satisfaction: Tubi identified five types of streamers in its research. From ""recommendation seekers"" to ""genre-focused browsers,"" they all share the same 3 drivers of satisfaction: ""a good mix"" of content, effective recommendations, and seamless navigation. When it comes to ease of use, the bar is higher for AVOD - 34% of streamers expect ease of use in SVODs while it jumps to 59% for FAST/AVOD.Viewers prefer light ad loads and standard ad formats: 51% of streamers are satisfied with 6 minutes of ads per hour. While streaming services experiment with new ad formats, Tubi found that standard video ads are currently preferred by streamers over other formats such as split screen, interactive, or QR code ads.Diverse and unreachable audiences drive AVOD spend: As advertisers evaluate the state of streaming TV, more ad dollars are being dedicated to streaming buys than ever before - 4 out of 5 advertisers now regard advertising on streaming television as highly valuable. Growth in monthly active users, the presence of otherwise hard to reach young and multicultural streamers, and the ability to reach hard to find audiences were cited as key drivers for AVOD ad spend.About the Data: Tubi commissioned survey research with leading industry insights providers. In Q1 2022, Tubi surveyed 3,000+ US pop who stream an hour or more a week with Qualtrics. In Q3 2022, Tubi surveyed 2,000 AVOD and SVOD streamers with Magid and 4,500 general streamers with Marketcast. All of this data was utilized to better understand the streaming landscape of 2022. Tubi also analyzed a number of first-party and third-party data sources, including a combination of MRI and self-reported data. About TubiTubi, Fox Corporation's ad-supported video-on-demand service, has over 50,000 movies and TV shows, including a growing library of Tubi Originals, 200+ local and live news and sports channels, and 455 entertainment partners, featuring content from every major Hollywood studio.

Secure your seat todayMark Hays’ recent opinion piece in CoinDesk titled “Stablecoins Are Not Worth the Risk” is off-base, both in describing the risks and by dismissing the benefits of these novel financial assets. A properly designed dollar coin is safe and desirable, especially for the very people Mr. Hays, a senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, aims to protect.Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia University Business School, is the author of several books including “Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets and Platforms.”First, some history: People have been using claims on a reserve as payment instruments for a thousand years. Paper money itself was originally invented as a receipt for metal held by a bank or money changer. Eventually, merchants realized it was easier to pay each other with the receipts than the metal itself.See also: Paxos 'Categorically Disagrees' With SEC That BUSD Is a SecurityAs I explain in my book “Re-Architecting Trust,” that basic design hasn’t changed much in a millennium, and things like bank checks, money orders and mobile payments operate on the same principle. Today, the vast majority of payments are made with transferable claims on a balance sheet.Fiat-backed stablecoins are no different. Financially speaking, sending someone 100 USDC is no different than sending them $100 via Venmo. In both cases, one user is handing over a claim against a balance sheet – Circle’s versus PayPal’s – to another. From the issuers point of view, each dollar held by its user is just a liability, to be matched against equivalent assets.So which is safer?Here's where things get interesting, because from the point of view of safety a properly designed stablecoin is more secure than anything that came before. That’s because half of the balance sheet of the issuer is recorded on-chain and can be verified in trustless fashion.Story continuesA good payment provider is one that always matches its assets and liabilities with like-instruments. Regulations and oversight are crucial in making sure they do. For Venmo, this means parent company PayPal’s regulators need to constantly collect data on user balances (liabilities) and check they match reserves in liquid capital (assets). Awkwardly, the primary source of data for PayPal’s liability is PayPal itself.This is a bit like police officers having to ask drivers how fast they were going before issuing a speeding ticket.Sure, there are reports and audits (and PayPal has likely always behaved responsibly) but the opacity is unavoidable. Stablecoin issuers are different because their liabilities – the tokens they issue – are visible on-chain. Even Tether, the much-maligned stablecoin issuer, can’t lie about token balances. Here they are.Mark Hays can’t say the same thing about PayPal.Instead, Hays focuses on strawman arguments against poorly designed stablecoins like terraUSD – the decentralized stablecoin that maintained its stability with a faulty algorithm. This is a new ecosystem and, like all new industries, bad ideas come (and fail) all the time.Even the first modern credit card, issued by Bank of America in 1958, was a disaster, complete with fraud, condemnation and regulatory scrutiny. Sound familiar?Even if safe, are they preferable?My colleague Austin Campbell has a helpful blog about different types of stablecoins and their potential impact. Mark Hays is right that stablecoins need to be regulated. But he’s dead wrong about their utility. Dollar stablecoins can be a powerful force for economic inclusion.See also: Stablecoins Are Not New. So Why Are Regulators Attacking Paxos? – Austin CampbellLike other critics, Hays is a westerner of means. That means he holds dollars and gets to use things like credit cards. This is not a luxury afforded to a substantial portion of the global population – people living in countries with high inflation and low access to banking.See also:Defenders of the status quo should spend a month living in Argentina, Egypt or Nigeria. If not convinced, they should take a walk through countless poor and immigrant communities in the U.S. where pseudo-financial services like check cashers dominate.If still not convinced, they should try sending large international wire on Saturday morning. God help them!Congress will come around tooDollar stablecoins aren’t just great for users, they are also great for the U.S. government because they increase demand for government debt at a time of high inflation and high deficits. Products like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC have already created over $100 billion in new demand for U.S. Treasurys, demand that’s much needed given the risk of de-dollarization.This makes a properly designed and regulated one the ultimate win-win. Great for the oppressed abroad and the U.S government at home. That’s the real reason congress is coming around.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned 0% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has gained 16.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share, indicating a change of +18.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.77 points to a change of +15.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.62 indicates a change of +17.8% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.29 billion and $32.12 billion estimates indicate +6.4% and +9.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), since the last five years saw the share price fall 12%.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the five years over which the share price declined, International Business Machines' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 20% each year. The share price decline of 2% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. So the market may previously have expected a drop, or else it expects the situation will improve. The high P/E ratio of 69.01 suggests that shareholders believe earnings will grow in the years ahead.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on International Business Machines' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for International Business Machines the TSR over the last 5 years was 18%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that International Business Machines has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 11% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 3% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

217,f78f9088-0707-3da4-b6a2-6c46a2968688,TAP,2023-02-15,Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-brewing-tap-reports-150003473.html,1676386803,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[The market expects Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +30.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.67 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.66% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model — the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Molson Coors?For Molson Coors, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.27%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Molson Coors will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Molson Coors would post earnings of $1.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of -2.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Molson Coors appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.Cautionary StatementThis release contains ""forward-looking"" statements regarding future results and events.

While used prices have fallen for seven straight months, new car prices have steadily risen every month since March 2021 (based on revised CPI numbers).January’s CPI data mirrored what most recent auto market data has been showing in recent months. Kelley Blue Book reports new car prices rose 5.9% versus a year ago, which has moderated somewhat, but the market share for luxury vehicles hit a new record in January (19.6% of the overall market). No surprise: the Cox Automotive/Moody’s affordability index found that the typical car payment for a new car in December, the latest data available, hit an estimated record of $777 a month.Kelley Blue Book new vehicle transaction price trends through Jan. 2023Conversely, used car market prices as measured by Manheim’s wholesale used car price index fell 12.8% versus a year ago in January; however, prices did climb slightly by 2.5% month over month. This slight uptick in used car prices created some fear that inflation was perking back up in the market as measured by wholesale prices. But another reason for this: used car dealers may have been buying up supply ahead of the spring buying season, which is usually brisk because of factors like tax refunds.Nonetheless, the trend seems to be that the red hot used car market of the pandemic is continuing to soften, whereas the new car market continues pushing higher.Meanwhile, automakers like GM (GM) and Ford (F) are making fewer cars than they were pre-pandemic, but are seeing profits rise as margins increase. While the trend of higher new car prices will moderate over time, the automakers have discovered that they prefer to sell fewer higher-priced cars, and tack on high-margin offerings like software features and other services to boost the bottom line.Story continuesThis means fewer cars in inventory for dealers, which helps avoid selling leftovers at reduced prices.“We're committed to actively managing production levels to balance supply with demand and our targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory on a portfolio basis,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in last quarter’s earnings conference call. Jacobson said this figure is 20 to 30 days below pre-pandemic levels.Ford Motor Company Chief Executive Bill Ford announces Ford will partner with Chinese-based, Amperex Technology, to build an all-electric vehicle battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, during a press conference in Romulus, Michigan U.S., February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Rebecca CookThe silver lining for consumers is that new car prices are expected to moderate, eventually, as automakers look to increase inventory at the dealer level as the component and chip crisis wanes—and competition heats up. Ford CFO John Lawler said the automaker expects new car prices to fall “around 5%” this year as higher incentives pull prices lower.Buyers looking to purchase a new car are hoping for that result. But if inflation remains stubborn, and the Fed decides to keep rates high leading to higher financing costs, buyers will have no choice but to seek better deals on the used car lots.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

After all, when it comes to picking stocks, they should strong competitive advantages that are in durable sectors. Some of the top stocks to buy and hold, include:MGMMGM.$43.83GMGeneral Motors$41.35NOWServiceNow$458.36ILMNIllumina$196.58BKNGBooking Holdings$2,348.37FTNTFortinet$59.61PYPLPayPal$80.80Stocks to Buy and Hold: MGM (MGM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comGiven MGM Resorts’ (NYSE:MGM) leverage to both Las Vegas and Internet gambling, it’s hard to find a better stock to buy and hold. For one, Las Vegas is a Mecca for professional sports,  entertainment, and conferences. Two, the city will continue attracting millions of people every year, which is great news for MGM.  Three, MGM has a strong foothold in Internet gambling. Specifically, BetMGM is the leader in the U.S. market when it comes to online casino games and  third in the country in sports betting. And in Nov., a gaming website identified BetMGM as the most likely contender to challenge FanDuel, the sector’s leader.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso noteworthy is that MGM is well-positioned to obtain casinos in the New York City area, which is soliciting bids for casinos for the first time and in Texas, which is believed to be likely to legalize casinos in the near-to-medium term. The casinos in those areas will, in all probability, be highly lucrative.Stocks to Buy and Hold: General Motors (GM)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Next up on this list of stocks to buy and hold is General Motors (NYSE:GM) is well-positioned for both the gasoline-dominated auto market, and the electric vehicle market. With regards to the gasoline-dominated market, General Motors was the leader in the U.S. in unit sales and generated record average transaction prices last quarter. Moreover, as CEO Mary Barra said,  GM’s “Chevrolet and GMC delivered more than 1.1 million full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and mid-size pickups in the U.S. which is about 350,000 units more than our closest competitor.”Story continuesWith regards to electric vehicles, GM has an impressive nine EVs available in North America.  The  company’s extremely affordable  Bolt EV and EUV, among the most inexpensive EVs available, “were the bestselling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year.” Even better, the company’s Cadillac Lyriq luxury EV, its Hummer EV pickup and and its BrightDrop electric delivery van is running ahead of GM’s ability to supply them.Stocks to Buy and Hold: ServiceNow (NOW)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWith its high-tech tools that automate IT tasks, ServiceNow’s (NYSE:NOW) top line soared 24% year-over-year, while its net cash provided by operating activities soared 38% year over year, despite high inflation. Also, boding well for the long-term outlook of NOW stock, on Dec. 24, Morgan Stanley named NOW as its top pick in the software sector, explaining that “The nature of the company’s subscription model gives us confidence in the durability of growth.” The bank also indicated that NOW’s focus on large customers makes it a stable, low-risk choice.Indeed last quarter the firm added a net total of  126 new customers whose annual contract value was $1 million or high, showing the company’s ability to attract many large customers. And the fact that ServiceNow’s subscription renewal rate came in at 98% last quarter shows that almost all of its customers are satisfied with its offerings. Of course, the latter metric bodes very well for the long-term outlook of NOW stock.Illumina (ILMN)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIllumina’s (NASDAQ:ILMN) products, which carry out DNA sequencing, enable scientists and healthcare professionals to analyze the composition of DNA,. As a result, they can create or utilize more effective, targeted treatments for patients.For example, in January 2022, Stanford Medicine utilized DNA sequencing ” to diagnose rare genetic diseases in an average of eight hours.” And an article about its achievement noted that DNA “sequencing is vital for diagnosing patients with diseases rooted in their DNA: Once doctors know the specific genetic mutation, they can tailor treatments accordingly.” Moreover, DNA sequencing is a vital component of personalized medicine, which is becoming more and more prevalent.Illumina has a huge  80% share of the global sequencing market, making it basically the Google of sequencing. Although it does have competitors, it appears to be staying ahead of them, unveiling a new , lower-cost line of sequencers last year.And in conjunction with its most recent earnings report, ILMN stated that the orders for its new sequencers were four times higher than during the last time it launched new ones.Booking.com (BKNG)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comAccording to BusinessofApps, Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG)  is “the largest online travel agency by booking volume and revenue, responsible for 25 percent of all hotel bookings worldwide.” I think it’s a safe bet that both travel and the internet are going to remain extremely popular for the next 20 years. That being said, Booking remains very well-positioned to continue to be the leader of the online travel agency sector during that time.With hundreds of millions of more citizens in China, India, and many other developing countries reaching middle-class status, enabling them to embark on international travel,  BKNG has a great deal of room to grow in the coming decades.In an indication of the growing strength of the global travel market, British bank Barclays in Nov. estimated that the global leisure travel sector would expand 12% this year. Also noteworthy is that the fund controlled by George Soros, who’s generally a very savvy investor, made BKNG stock its second largest new buy in the third quarter of last year.Fortinet (FTNT)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) has clearly become a leader within the cybersecurity sector. And last Oct., the very well-respected research firm, McKinney, reported that , “Cyberattacks are proliferating, causing trillions of dollars of damage every year.” The firm reported that in a 2022 survey of midsized companies, almost 80% reported that they has experienced cyber threats in 2021. McKinney believes that the cybersecurity market is expanding at a hefty annual rate of 12.4% and, over time, could expand from a $150 billion market in 2021 to $2 trillion. It also predicts that the damage from cyberattacks could reach $10.5 trillion in 2025, representing a 300% surge from 2015 levels.Moreover, FTNT has multiple solutions for remote workers, leaving it well-positioned for the work-from-home era. In 2022, Fortinet’s top line surged a very impressive 33%, and the company stated that its market share in the IT security sector rose in 2022. Finally, the company’s 2022 operating income jumped an incredible 67% year-over-year to $358 million. The data shows that FTNT is thriving in the IT security sector, and all indications are that it will continue to do so.PayPal (PYPL)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has clearly become the leader of the digital payment sector. As a result, the company is very well-positioned to benefit tremendously from the continued transition to digital payments.Over time, PayPal’s expanding alliances with e-commerce giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are likely to cause the growth of the fintech company’s top and bottom lines to accelerate.Also noteworthy is that the company has avoided becoming closely involved with  the crypto sector, preventing its reputation and balance sheet from being hurt by crypto’s deteriorating prices and status in society.Over the last three years, PayPal’s top line has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. Meanwhile, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, have jumped at a compound annual growth rate of about 17%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in MGM and ILMN.

224,eb445f62-106c-31b9-90c8-2989b6b1ec88,GM,2023-02-15,What Big Auto Companies Are Telling Us About EVs,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-auto-companies-telling-us-140042462.html,1676124042,STORY,"['GM', 'NFLX', 'F', 'HMC', 'TM']","[In preparation for the Super Bowl tomorrow, companies have been releasing teasers of their commercials to come. And there was one in particular that caught my eye.General Motors Company (GM) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) have partnered with comedy actor Will Ferrell to showcase new GM electric vehicles (EVs) – and possibly other EV manufacturers – in spoofs of popular Netflix shows.Will Ferrell in 2023 GM Super Bowl commercialWill Ferrell drives a GMC Sierra EV Denali as he is chased by zombies from Netflix’s Army of the Dead in the ad spot. Source: &lt;em&gt;Fox Business&lt;/em&gt;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe main goal is to help normalize EVs for the average American household and help make them feel more accessible. GM’s Chief Marketing Officer, Deborah Wahl, stated that “the more we see electric vehicles show up in this type of binge-worthy content, the faster everyone gets used to them.”Now, while we’re on the topic of EVs… The Hummer plant at Factory Zero in Detroit commenced last week. GM has 90,000 Hummer orders that it needs to fulfill. Ironically, GM decided to launch the Hummer before its Denali Edition 1 pickup, which it hopes to begin delivering in early 2024.GMC &amp; Buick Global Vice President Duncan Aldred said at a roundtable, “What is more of a limiting factor is the amount of battery cells that are available.” The Hummer has a 212-kwh battery pack, which is double what most EVs need, so this flagship vehicle is actually constraining GM’s overall EV production.GM’s sole battery supplier, LG Energy Solution, obtained a $2.5 billion loan to build three new U.S. battery plants to supply GM in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Unlike Ford Motor Company (F), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Volkswagen Group (VWAGY), GM is not planning on utilizing iron-phosphate batteries to supplement the shortage of lithium-ion batteries that is constraining production for many EV models.As these production constraints continue, it will be interesting to see what happens to EV sales. So, it’s great that earnings season is here, because it gives investors a better picture of what is happening with the EV market.Story continuesSo, in today’s Market 360, let’s dig a little deeper and look at some of the auto manufacturers that recently reported their quarterly earnings.General Motors Company (GM) – Announced Tuesday, January 31General Motors’ fourth-quarter report beat analyst expectations and revealed that the company anticipates another solid year in 2023. For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $43.1 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share. Analysts expected revenue of $40.65 billion and earnings of $1.69 per share.For its fiscal year 2022, GM reported adjusted earnings of $7.59 per share on $156.7 billion in revenue, which represented 7.4% annual earnings growth and 18.9% annual revenue growth.For full-year 2023, company management forecast net income attributable to stockholders to be between $8.7 billion and $10.1 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected to be between $6.00 and $7.00 per share.Looking at GM’s future EV plans, the company is entering phase two of its EV acceleration. With this, GM will offer nine EV models in 2023. This includes the first electrified, all-wheel-drive Corvette. GM also stated that it expects its EV business to generate over $50 billion in revenue by 2025.General Motors is currently number one in the U.S. for total sales, full-size pickup trucks and large luxury SUVS as well as luxury sports cars.Ford Motor Company (F) – Announced Thursday, February 2Ford shares dipped following the company’s mixed quarterly report, however, the auto manufacturer posted stunning year-over-year earnings growth. Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings nearly doubled to $0.51 per share, up from $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share. Fourth-quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $44.0 billion, which topped estimates for $40.37 billion.For its fiscal year 2022, Ford reported adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share on $158.1 billion in revenue, which represented 18.2% annual earnings growth and 16% annual revenue growth. The consensus estimate called for full-year adjusted earnings of $1.99 per share on $146.56 billion in revenue.Ford noted that 650,000 F-Series trucks were shipping in 2022, claiming the best-selling truck in America for the 46-consecutive year. The company also expects to produce 600,000 electric vehicles per year by the end of 2023 – and aims to produce two million by the end of 2026.Before the earnings report, Ford announced on Monday, January 31, that it is lowering the price of its Mach-E by $600 to $5,900 depending on the model. Although the Mach-E has not been profitable for Ford due to higher battery component costs, Mach-E production is expected to increase from 78,000 annual production to 130,000 this year.Mari Gjajs, the head of Ford’s EV business said, “We are responding to changes in the marketplace” and added, “As we look and want to stay competitive in the marketplace, we’re having the respond.”Ford Motor is currently number two in U.S. EV sales, so clearly it intends to continue to capture a significant share of EV sales.Toyota Motor Company (TM) – Announced Wednesday, February 8The latest results from Toyota revealed better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter in fiscal year 2023 but provided weak forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter, net profit declined 8.1% year-over-year to 727.94 billion yen, or $5.54 billion. However, this topped analysts’ estimates for 717.6 billion yen.Revenue increased 25.2% year-over-year to 9.755 trillion yen, or $74 billion. Company management also maintained its full-year 2023 guidance for retail vehicle sales of 10.4 million.For the first nine months in fiscal year 2023, Toyota reported earnings per share of 138.78 yen which represented a 16% earnings decline from 166.45 yen a year ago.Company management commented:“Under circumstances where production plans fluctuated greatly due to factors such as semiconductor shortages and natural disasters, we worked hard with our dealers, suppliers, and production sites. Operating income for the first nine months decreased, but operating income for the third quarter alone increased, as the positive effects of a weaker yen and volume increase exceeded the negative effect of soaring materials prices.”Taking a peek under the hood at Toyota’s EV numbers, the auto manufacturer sold 12,000 worldwide. Hybrids and EVs accounted for almost 28% of Toyota’s sales. U.S. sales rose 13% year-over-year to 536,740 vehicles. Brand sales increased nearly 17% to 476,648 vehicles.Now, along with earnings, Toyota also announced its new promotion with Nintendo ADR (NTDOY) that will allow 500 Grand Highlanders customers to receive a Nintendo Switch with the Mario Kart 8 game included. “This is an amazing collaboration between Toyota and Nintendo. The Grand Highlander and the Nintendo Switch are the ultimate duo for families and road trips,” said Lisa Materazzo, group vice president of Toyota Marketing.Honda Motor Company (HMC) – Announced Friday, February 10Honda reported solid third-quarter earnings before the market open yesterday. Third-quarter revenue increased 17.3% year-over-year to 12,523.4 billion yen, up from 10,677.0 billion yen a year ago.Honda noted that operating profit was 733.9 billion yen, a 9.3% year-over-year increase from 671.6 billion yen a year ago. This marks a new record for the company. Honda’s motorcycle business revenue climbed 37.5% year-over-year to 2,202.3 billion yen, which was “due primarily to higher sales in Asia and favorable currency effects.” However, Honda still cut its full-year sales revenue by 150 billion yen to 17,250 billion yen.Regarding Honda’s EV plans, the company expects to launch a commercial-use mini-EV in Japan starting in the spring of 2024. Company management also announced a line of new electric motorcycles in Europe and China, making Honda the frontrunner of the electric motorcycles global market.Based on the earnings reports and guidance, EV growth is tapping the brakes for most of these companies. If you’re looking for growth, then consider the energy sector. As I discussed in Friday’s Market 360 article, the energy sector continues to post the best earnings growth. It’s why my Growth Investor Buy Lists are heavily overweighted in energy stocks, and I expect them to do well this year as natural gas and crude oil prices firm up.Click here for full details.Sincerely,Source: InvestorPlace unless otherwise notedLouis NavellierEditor, Market 360P.S.

If you want to see more most profitable bank stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In.Many big banks did not do well during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Given home values decreased substantially in 2008, some financial institutions that made riskier loans lost a lot of money. Considering the economy slowed substantially in 2008, even more financial institutions lost a lot of money as well. With the slowing economy, leading investment bank Lehman Brothers eventually went bankrupt, and the government had to eventually bail out some of the big banks.As a result of the financial crisis, some big banks were labeled as systemically important, meaning their failure could lead to instability in the financial system.Although shareholders of systematically important institutions could still lose all their money if the institution failed, the government placed more regulation on those systemically important institutions and as a result, many of the big banks had to have more capital than before that weighed on their profitability.Nevertheless, big banks have done well over the last ten years given the growing U.S. economy even though there has been some dips due to market declines or the pandemic. Many U.S. banks have also benefited from higher interest rates. Many banks find it easier to make more in net interest margin when interest rates are a little higher than when they are near zero.Although interest rates have risen substantially in 2022, many big bank stocks did not do well, however.One reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also led to a considerable increase in U.S. Treasury yields. As a result of substantially higher Treasury yields, a lot of capital moved from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and many leading equity stock valuations decreased as a result.Another reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also increased the chance of a recession. If there is a recession, bank loan losses could increase and this could lead to lower than expected profits or even losses that might send their stocks lower.Story continuesWhile inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year, many expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. If it raises rates too much further, the odds of a recession or an economic slowdown that might send bank stocks lower will increase.Given some companies might underperform or the economy could worsen, leading bank stocks might not achieve their potential. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.kmichal/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In, we took the 10 largest banks by market capitalization in the United States and ranked them based on the amount of TTM net income they had according to YCharts.Because we used YCharts data, the net income data might not be adjusted earnings.10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In10.

This company, which is in the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This discount retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 18.36%.For the last reported quarter, Ross Stores came out with earnings of $1 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.81 per share, representing a surprise of 23.46%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.11 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.27%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ross Stores lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ross Stores has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included in this press release.

Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s use of non GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain acquisition related expenses1, which are described further below. Adjusted gross margin percentage represents adjusted gross margin divided by revenue.Adjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating expenses percentage represents adjusted operating expenses divided by revenue.Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by revenue.Adjusted nonoperating expense (income) is defined as nonoperating expense (income), determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, which is described further below.Adjusted income before income taxes is defined as income before income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below.Adjusted provision for income taxes is defined as provision for income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding tax related items4 , which are described further below. Adjusted tax rate represents adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes.Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, special charges, net3, and tax related items4, which are described further below.Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net. Free cash flow revenue percentage represents free cash flow divided by revenue.1Acquisition Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to debt, inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include fair value adjustments associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.2Acquisition Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.3Special Charges, net: Expenses, net, incurred as part of the integration of the Acquisition, in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, other accelerated stock-based compensation expense and other cost reduction efforts or reorganizational initiatives. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.4Tax Related Items: Income tax effect of the non-GAAP items discussed above and certain other income tax benefits associated with prior periods. We excluded the income tax effect of these tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.About Analog DevicesAnalog Devices, Inc.

ADI is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 15.For the fiscal first quarter, ADI expects revenues of $3.15 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.14 billion, indicating an improvement of 16.9% from the year-ago reported figure.Analog Devices anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $2.60 (+/- $0.10) per share for the quarter under review. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $2.60 per share, indicating a 34% rise from the previous year’s reported figure.Earnings of ADI surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average being 7.8%.Analog Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Analog Devices, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAnalog Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderStrength across consumer, communication, industrial and automotive end-markets is expected to have driven the top line of Analog Devices in the fiscal first quarter.The solid momentum of Analog Devices’ precision signal chain, power franchises, sensing technologies, and wired and wireless connectivity among factory automation applications is expected to have contributed well to its industrial revenues in the quarter under review.The company’s power management and RF portfolios are likely to have aided growth across instrumentation and test applications. The upside, in turn, is expected to have driven industrial revenues.Strength in home entertainment, hearables and wearables is expected to have aided ADI’s performance in the consumer market in the to-be-reported quarter.Apart from these, the growing deployment of 5G is expected to have continued benefiting the company’s performance in the communication end-market.The growing traction across Battery Management System (BMS) and A2B solutions is likely to have driven Analog Devices’ performance in the automotive market in the fiscal first quarter. The rising uptake of BMS solution in the electric vehicle space is likely to have been a tailwind.However, weak momentum across major applications and a leveraged balance sheet are likely to have been concerning. Further, the pandemic-induced supply-chain constraints and geopolitical tensions are expected to have acted as major overhangs.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Analog Devices this time around.

244,4b2297ea-5605-356e-8b9e-9b4787b0c596,V,2023-02-15,Is Visa Inc.'s (NYSE:V) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-latest-110058078.html,1676458858,STORY,['V'],"[Visa's (NYSE:V) stock is up by 8.7% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Visa's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Visa How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Visa is:41% = US$15b ÷ US$37b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.41 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Visa's Earnings Growth And 41% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Visa has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 15% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Visa's moderate 9.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Visa's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Visa is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Visa Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In Visa's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 23% (or a retention ratio of 77%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Besides, Visa has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 20%. Still, forecasts suggest that Visa's future ROE will rise to 53% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Visa's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

245,97c286cf-ccb8-3de7-a424-5ed360785a5f,V,2023-02-15,Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ray-dalio-stock-portfolio-top-173110973.html,1676395870,STORY,"['ABT', 'COST', 'MDLZ', 'MCD', 'PFE', 'PDD', 'V', 'PEP', 'CL', 'SBUX', 'PG', 'JNJ']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.Dow Changes Course in 2023In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Lags Peers Year to DateLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1%, below the consensus mark of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. The data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Market participants are expecting two more rate hike of 25 basis points each in 2023.The technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants’ confidence returning to this sector. Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.8% and 13.6%, respectively. The Dow gained just 3.3%.U.S. Economy is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter’s growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy may have expanded by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.Story continuesA devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the direction desired by the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities is the primary reasons for recent job cuts.Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward. As a result, growth and momentum stocks may underperform cyclical value stocks in 2023. Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

248,042dba8f-4ced-3038-bb31-f25fffc59dee,MAR,2023-02-15,U.S. natgas futures slide 2% on forecasts for less demand,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-natgas-futures-slide-2-132727710.html,1676467647,STORY,['NG=F'],"[Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures slid about 2% on Wednesday on forecasts for lower demand than previously expected over the next two weeks. That price decline came despite forecasts for colder weather in late February, an increase in the amount of gas going to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants to an eight-month high, and a decline in gas output so far this month. Front-month gas futures for March delivery fell 3.8 cents, or 1.5%, to $2.529 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) by 8:04 a.m. EST (1304 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its highest since Feb. 7. The amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants was on track to reach 13.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Wednesday, the highest since May 2022, due to a rapid increase in flows to Freeport LNG's export plant in Texas as the facility prepares to exit an eight-month outage caused by a fire in June 2022. Freeport LNG, the second-biggest U.S. LNG export plant, was on track to pull in 0.5 bcfd of gas from pipelines for a third day in an row on Wednesday, according to data provider Refinitiv. When operating at full power, Freeport LNG can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export. Earlier this week, Freeport LNG asked federal regulators for permission to put the first phase of its restart plan into commercial operation. Phase 1 includes the full operation of the plant's three liquefaction trains, which turn gas into LNG, two storage tanks and one LNG loading dock. Energy regulators and analysts, however, have said they do not expect Freeport LNG to return to full commercial operation until mid-March or later. A couple of Freeport LNG's customers - Japan's JERA and Osaka Gas - have said they do not expect to get LNG from the plant until after March. Federal regulators approved the restart of Freeport LNG liquefaction Train 3 but have not authorized the facility to commence liquefaction operations. Freeport LNG still needs permission from regulators to place new LNG in the tanks and transfer it to ships. The LNG loaded on to ships from Freeport LNG over the past several days is old LNG that was already in the tanks. A third vessel, LNG Rosenrot, arrived at the plant over the past 24 hours, according to Refinitiv ship tracking data. U.S. GAS OUTPUT Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell from 98.3 bcfd in January to 97.0 bcfd so far in February, after extreme cold earlier in February froze oil and gas wells in several producing basins. That compared with a monthly record of 99.8 bcfd in November 2022. Meteorologists forecast the weather would remain mostly near normal through March 2 except for several cold days around Feb. 17-18 and Feb. 23-March 1. With colder weather coming, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 117.6 bcfd this week to 122.3 bcfd next week. Those forecasts, however, were lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Tuesday. With the amount of gas flowing to Freeport LNG rising, the average amount of feedgas going to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants climbed to 12.8 bcfd so far in February, up from 12.3 bcfd in January. That compares with a monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022 before Freeport LNG shut. The seven big U.S. export plants, including Freeport LNG, can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.

Revenue rose 26% to $255.98 billion.Record profits from energy giants like Shell, BP and ExxonMobil last year have stirred calls for those companies to do more to reduce high utility bills for households and businesses and invest more in efforts to cut climate-changing emissions.The surge in cash generation narrowed Glencore's net debt to $100 million, “allowing for today’s announcement of $7.1 billion ... of shareholder returns” through cash distributions and a share buyback program, CEO Gary Nagle said in a statement.He also pointed to some potential upsides ahead, including China lifting tough zero-COVID restrictions. That's despite higher inflation and interest rates that present “some risk” to the economic forecast this year.“China’s reopening, however, together with a continued global focus on energy security and decarbonization (and) electrification, mean that demand for many of our commodities is likely to remain healthy, while supply constraints persist and inventories remain relatively low,” Nagle said.Glencore also could benefit from U.S. legislation that directs new spending toward technology meant to reduce carbon emissions and a European Union plan to favor greener policies.Such initiatives “demonstrate the growing need for critical raw materials through to the end of the decade and beyond, necessitating fresh investment in both primary supply and recycling,” Nagle said.Glencore's record profits come after it reached a deal with authorities in the United States, Britain and Brazil last year to resolve corruption and market manipulation allegations in return for penalties totaling up to $1.5 billion.]"

For fans planning to attend events at the Salt Palace, Jon M. Huntsman Center or Vivint Arena, or the many activities surrounding the events throughout the community, Verizon has made major network enhancements throughout Salt Lake City.Salt Lake City was one of the first cities in the US to have cutting-edge 5G technology deployed in 2019, enabling customers to do everything from downloading huge documents and seamlessly streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats and video conferencing calls with clear sound and video while on the move. Verizon engineers have not slowed down since. Verizon’s 4G and 5G Ultra Wideband small cell network in the Downtown, Central City, and University neighborhoods are designed to handle large, dense crowds at sporting events, outdoor concerts, festivals, and other high-traffic, high-usage gatherings. Verizon engineers have been enhancing this stellar coverage by adding 5G Ultra Wideband service using Verizon’s premium mmWave spectrum, designed to manage wireless traffic in densely populated areas and its recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G service.“We know how important staying connected and sharing the moment with friends and family is to customers when they are participating in exciting events like this one,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations at Verizon. “We are working to ensure our customers can count on our network in Salt Lake City.”For visitors traveling to Salt Lake City, Verizon has permanent Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) which provide 4G and 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout Salt Palace, the Huntsman Center and Vivint Arena and the Salt Lake City Airport. These DAS systems are networks of antennas that deliver wireless service within a geographical area of a large building or venue where traditional cell sites can not reach. These systems, which include unseen cables connecting numerous antennas driving the system, are common in high-traffic areas such as stadiums, convention or shopping centers, office buildings, train stations, airline terminals, and even dense, outdoor urban areas.Story continuesTo support first responders during the exhibition game, Verizon’s response team will mobilize a portable small cell site that provides coverage using a satellite link and a portable generator. This mobile cell site, referred to as a SPOT (satellite picocell on a trailer), can supplement capacity for first responders if extra capacity is needed.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Salt Lake City. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Salt Lake City area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data, so customers can stream, share videos, access apps and connect with their friends and family more.So for customers living in or traveling to Salt Lake City for all the upcoming basketball action, Verizon has a network they can count on.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

(NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the options investors should consider for their portfolios this year, considering his own optimism regarding the market. He has added that price stability is just around the corner, and while some weaker companies will most likely never be able to recover, high-end companies will manage to survive.While the Federal Reserve does not seem to be relenting entirely when it comes to interest rates, the hikes have gotten smaller.Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023Let's now take a look at Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 stocks that have been named by Jim Cramer on CNBC's Mad Money this January as his top picks for 2023. We have also mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks, ensuring they are positive. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 202310. Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is an industrial machinery company based in New Britain, Connecticut.

(NYSE:SWK) shares.Story continuesThis January, Jim Cramer recommended that investors should start a small position in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in 2023 and gradually buy more. He believes that the stock will continue to see gains in 2023 after its performance last year. Revenues for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) have increased by almost 70% over the past ten years. The stock's most attractive quality, however, is its status as a dividend king, with a record of 55 years of dividend increases. It has a yield of 3.59% as of February 14.Greenhaven Associates was the largest stakeholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in the fourth quarter, holding 1.3 million shares.

(NYSE:SWK) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), is among Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.9. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) is a utility company based in Columbus, Ohio. The company engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for sale in the US.Neil Kalton at Wells Fargo holds an Equal Weight rating on American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) shares as of February 1.In January, Cramer named American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) as one of the stocks he believes to be a worthwhile addition to investors' portfolios.

It also offers unmanned autonomous aircraft systems.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shares on February 6 by Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle.Jim Cramer this January commented that Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could be the best defense contracted to own as the Russo-Ukrainian war persists.

Here's what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Here's what the firm said:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Shares have been on an impressive trajectory recently, outpacing the notable move in the overall oilfield services and equipment group. Halliburton benefits from the ongoing upswing in global upstream spending and should play a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate the recent productivity declines in North American shale. The tight services and equipment market has resulted in strong pricing gains and margin expansion, and when coupled with a disciplined approach to capital spending, has paved the way for the stock’s outperformance.”6۔ McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a healthcare company based in Irving, Texas.

The stock price rose on solid financial results as its business is less exposed to current macroeconomic headwinds. We continue to have conviction that McKesson can grow earnings per share by an average of 12% to 14% annually and think the stock is still reasonably valued.”McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), like Netflix, Inc.

We have Nvidia, Comcast, and Under Armour. Kicking it off with Nvidia, Bank of America making the case that the company can lead the, quote, ""AI arms race."" The firm says that the chipmaker is well positioned to capitalize on growing interest in artificial intelligence and sees it as a catalyst for long-term growth in its very important data center division. The firm raising its price target on the chipmaker to 255 a share, substantially higher from where it is today, about 25 bucks higher there.Well, taking a look at the fact that it's not exactly going to be a smooth ride here for the company, given the recent gains that we've seen, but Bank of America warning that we could see some pullbacks, but they don't expect any of those downturns to be long-lived. They expect those to be very short-lived and a quick bounce back here. Allie, lots of talk, lots of hype about the AI space. We have heard it on a number of earnings calls this earnings season. Nvidia, at least, the Bank of America's point of view, thinks that they are very, very well positioned in that space.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and AI had already been a heavily invested area, but then certainly with the explosion of ChatGPT, it's just reinvigorated a lot of these conversations and a lot of these stocks. Bank of America also saying in that note that ChatGPT and those other types of services could boost Nvidia's revenue by 25% annually through 2027, since those types of large language programming, they require a lot of computing. Therefore, the demand for chips, that's going to be through the roof. And it's certainly something to watch with this stock, considering shares are up about 60% year to date.]"

The launch of ChatGPT and the AI wars that ensued are also giving a boost to Cathie Wood’s predictions about innovation and futuristic sectors like artificial intelligence, molecular diagnostics and autonomous cars.Is the outperformance of Cathie Wood’s portfolio because of the short-term market rally? Will ARK investors have to wait for five or ten more years to reap the rewards of their patience and investments?Many believe the current market rally won’t last for long. The latest jobs report which showed the strength of the labor market is already dashing hopes of market bulls as analysts believe the Federal Reserve now has more impetus to continue on its rate-hike spree despite signs that inflation is slowing.One of the notable market experts advising caution is JPMorgan Chase’s Marko Kolanovic who recently advised investors to use the current market rally as an opportunity to cut their exposure. The analyst said that the disinflationary process in the US could be “transitionary.”Story continuesKolanovic thinks strengths in the labor market could kill the possibility of soft landing. In such situation the Federal Reserve would try to tame inflation while the economy would keep growing.“If that doesn’t come into fruition, it will result in a mean-reversion across this year’s equity winners,” Kolanovic said.Cathie Wood of ARK Investment ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we studied Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management’s Q4 portfolio and picked 10 tech stocks in which the hedge fund cut its exposure during the period.

Core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, slowed to an annualized pace of 5.6% in January, though that was smaller than the expected decrease of 5.5%.“Inflation has peaked but isn't declining as quickly as the Fed would have liked,” Jefferies said in a note.The 2-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to rate hikes, jumped to a more than 3-month high, topping 4.6% as investors continue to price further Fed rate hikes.Markets are now expecting that “the FOMC will raise its terminal rate from 5.25% in December to 5.5% in March when the dots get updated, and possibly higher,” Scotiabank Economics said in a note.The move higher in rates pegged back growth sectors of the market including big tech, but that was more than offset by strength in semiconductors, led by Nvidia.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) closed more than 5% higher after Bank of America waxed lyrical about the chipmaker’s potential boost from a surge in demand for artificial intelligence programs.Nvidia is in pole position to lead the “AI arms race,” Bank of America said and raised its price target on the chipmaker to $255 from $215 a share.Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), meanwhile, was also a source of optimism for tech as the data analytics company’s stock price soared 21% after reporting its maiden quarterly profit.The company said it expected to remain in profit for 2023, confounding Wall Street expectations for a full year loss of 11 cents a share. But some remain cautious on the stock, citing “ambitious” guidance.Story continues“Palantir established another seemingly overly ambitious target of 40% US Commercial growth in CY23. All in all, we walked away from the print incrementally cautious, and we're sticking with our underperform rating,” Deutsche Bank said in a note.Elsewhere on the earnings front, Avis (NASDAQ:CAR) delivered quarterly earnings of $10.46 a share, markedly better than forecasts of $6.81 a share, sending its stock up 10%.Consumer staples were one of the biggest drags on the market, weighed down by a more than 1% fall in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) after the beverage giant reported in-line earnings, but revenue that topped estimates.Coca-Cola’s bottom line was kept in check by “headwinds from the BODYARMOR acquisition and higher operating costs,” Goldman Sachs said, though pointed to “strong” guidance as a reason for optimism.“Overall we think KO’s guidance is reflective of better than feared consumer elasticities despite the recent and significant price increases the industry has implemented,” it added.Related ArticlesStock market today: Dow slides as signs of sticky inflation push up Fed hike betsMexico's America Movil Q4 net profit tumbles 90%Air India seals record order for almost 500 Airbus, Boeing jets]"

The company expects first-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 82-90 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 81 cents.Our TakeEcolab exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top line, along with solid performances across all segments. Strong volume and pricing momentum are also encouraging. Ecolab’s business wins and innovation pipelines are well-positioned to drive growth and global leadership. The company’s digital capabilities are continuing to broaden, develop and add competitive advantages, which are encouraging. In the reported quarter, Purolite delivered a strong performance, benefiting from its recent capacity additions, which looks promising.However, the bottom-line performance in the reported quarter is disappointing. The company faced significant delivered product cost inflation and unfavorable currency translation, which weighed on its top-line growth.

The US economy has been in a state of downturn, making the market highly vulnerable and investors more cautious about investing in new companies.Cramer has still named stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the options investors should consider for their portfolios this year, considering his own optimism regarding the market. He has added that price stability is just around the corner, and while some weaker companies will most likely never be able to recover, high-end companies will manage to survive.While the Federal Reserve does not seem to be relenting entirely when it comes to interest rates, the hikes have gotten smaller.Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2023Let's now take a look at Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 stocks that have been named by Jim Cramer on CNBC's Mad Money this January as his top picks for 2023. We have also mentioned analyst ratings for these stocks, ensuring they are positive. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest.Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks for 202310. Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is an industrial machinery company based in New Britain, Connecticut. It operates in the US, Canada, the rest of the Americas, France, the rest of Europe, and Asia. The company offers products like professional-grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment.On February 5, Barclay analyst Julian Mitchell reiterated an Overweight rating on Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) shares.Story continuesThis January, Jim Cramer recommended that investors should start a small position in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in 2023 and gradually buy more. He believes that the stock will continue to see gains in 2023 after its performance last year. Revenues for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) have increased by almost 70% over the past ten years. The stock's most attractive quality, however, is its status as a dividend king, with a record of 55 years of dividend increases. It has a yield of 3.59% as of February 14.Greenhaven Associates was the largest stakeholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in the fourth quarter, holding 1.3 million shares.

(NYSE:SWK) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“Shares of Stanley Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) sharply declined in the quarter as inflation and rapidly rising rates drove a swift deterioration in consumer demand. In response, SWK is laser-focused on reducing inventory to generate cash flow and re-sizing the cost base through simplifying its corporate structure, optimizing operations and transforming the supply chain. Though the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging, we have conviction in SWK’s experienced executive management team and think the balance sheet is well-positioned to weather the storm. At current levels, SWK is trading at a substantial, historically-high discount to our estimate of private market value.”Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), is among Jim Cramer's top stock picks for 2023.9. American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) is a utility company based in Columbus, Ohio. The company engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for sale in the US.Neil Kalton at Wells Fargo holds an Equal Weight rating on American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) shares as of February 1.In January, Cramer named American Electric Power Company, Inc. (NYSE:AEP) as one of the stocks he believes to be a worthwhile addition to investors' portfolios. He likes the stock because the company is well-run, and utility companies are known to perform well in an economic downturn. American Electric Power Company, Inc.

The company designs and manufactures aircraft systems in the US and internationally. It also offers unmanned autonomous aircraft systems.An Outperform rating was reiterated on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shares on February 6 by Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle.Jim Cramer this January commented that Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could be the best defense contracted to own as the Russo-Ukrainian war persists. In the fourth quarter, the company had robust sales growth of 16% year-over-year.

Here's what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Here's what the firm said:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Shares have been on an impressive trajectory recently, outpacing the notable move in the overall oilfield services and equipment group. Halliburton benefits from the ongoing upswing in global upstream spending and should play a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate the recent productivity declines in North American shale. The tight services and equipment market has resulted in strong pricing gains and margin expansion, and when coupled with a disciplined approach to capital spending, has paved the way for the stock’s outperformance.”6۔ McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a healthcare company based in Irving, Texas.

The company also provides prescription technology solutions that connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical customers.

276,d41a439a-fcb3-3002-a0e4-8205f6a14aeb,GPC,2023-02-15,Expect a Beat From These 3 Auto Stocks This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-beat-3-auto-stocks-113111025.html,1676460671,STORY,"['ALSN', 'GPC']","[The Auto-Tires-Trucks sector is more than halfway through the Q4 earnings season. The picture thus far has been pretty decent despite supply chain issues and economic worries. So far, seven S&amp;P 500 sector components — Tesla, Ford, General Motors, PACCAR, O’Reilly Automotive, Cummins and BorgWarner — have reported quarterly numbers. While Ford and Cummins failed to beat earnings estimates, the other five companies managed to pull off a surprise.Per the Earnings Trend report dated Feb 1, the auto sector’s earnings for Q4 are expected to grow 62.1% on a year-over-year basis. As for revenues, they are estimated to rise 21.4% year over year.With a host of companies still left to release fourth-quarter 2022 results, we have identified, with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, a few auto players — Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN, Genuine Parts Company GPC and Lucid Group LCID — which are positioned to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. Before we discuss the companies, let’s take a look at the factors shaping the quarterly performance of automotive companies.Factors at PlayThe fourth quarter of 2022 was a mixed bag for the auto space, with some automakers witnessing a year-over-year increase in the number of vehicles sold while others saw a decline. In general, what aided the industry was the gradual abatement of chip woes and a slight improvement in supply chain systems. As such, inventory levels were on the rise. Inventory levels in December were more than one million units for the third consecutive month, per J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. Per TrueCar, the total new light-vehicle inventory, including fleet and commercial vehicles, totaled 1.8 million in December 2022, up from 1.1 million recorded in December 2021.Despite economic uncertainty, the demand for vehicles largely managed to show resilience during the last three months of 2022. The rising deliveries of new energy vehicles (including all-electric, hybrids and fuel-cell) are expected to have fueled revenues. However, for the less-affluent and subprime consumers, the rising cost of financing is expected to have played spoilsport. Per estimates of J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, average interest rates for new vehicle loans were up around 250 basis points from the year-ago levels. High interest rates eat away vehicle buyers' willingness and ability to purchase. This may have limited revenues to some extent.Story continuesAs for the average price of vehicles, used car prices are on a decline, while new car prices during the quarter under discussion have remained high. High new vehicle prices are likely to have offset commodity cost inflation partially. High costs of raw materials, manufacturing inefficiency, rising freight and fuel costs may have limited margins.Picking Potential WinnersWhile it is not possible to be sure about which companies are well positioned to beat earnings estimates, our proprietary methodology — Earnings ESP — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the abovementioned combination, the chances of an earnings beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesAllison: Strategic buyouts and frequent product launches are likely to aid Allison’s upcoming results. FracTran, TerraTran and 3414 Regional Haul Series along with Allison’s eGen Power portfolio are likely to have secured business wins, thereby aiding fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from ALSN’s North America On-Highway segment is pegged at $327 million, up from $281 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company’s upbeat 2022 projections also spark optimism for the upcoming quarter’s results.Allison has an Earnings ESP of +2.23% and a Zacks Rank #2. This auto equipment provider is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results today. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Allison’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.21 per share and $676 million, respectively. ALSN surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other, with the average surprise being 10.3%.Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAllison Transmission Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. QuoteLucid: Lucid manufactured 3,493 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2022 at its manufacturing facility in Arizona. This was a new record and the figure was up 53% sequentially. Thanks to the solid production during the three months that ended Dec 31, the company surpassed its 2022 output target of 6000-7000 vehicles. During the quarter under discussion, it delivered 1,932 vehicles, marking a jump of 38.2% from the third quarter of 2022. Robust customer demand for Lucid Air is likely to have boosted fourth-quarter revenues.Lucid has an Earnings ESP of +3.90% and a Zacks Rank #2. This EV maker is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lucid’s to-be-reported quarter’s loss and revenues is pegged at 39 cents per share and $290 million, respectively. LCID surpassed earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average surprise being 11.2%.Lucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLucid Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lucid Group, Inc. QuoteGenuine Parts: The increase in the average age of vehicles (12.2 years according to IHS Markit data) is likely to have positively impacted sales of Genuine Parts’ products. For the smooth functioning of aging vehicles, customers have been spending heavily to replace any faulty parts and components. This is expected to have boosted GPC’s revenues. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the firm’s fourth-quarter revenues from the Automotive and Industrial segments is pegged at $3,281 million and $1,997 million, indicating a rise from $3,190 million and $1,613 million, respectively, in the previous-year quarter.Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of +5.37% and a Zacks Rank #2. This auto replacement parts provider is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.89 per share and $5.33 billion, respectively.

""Freedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported, and not rooted in sound financial analysis.""Giuliani's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.Smartmatic has said it provided election technology only to Los Angeles County, which Biden won.Story continues""We look forward to holding Fox News and the other defendants accountable in court,"" its lawyer J.

Here's a quick peek.[FRANK TURNER, ""I STILL BELIEVE""](SINGING) And I still believe.- Well, if seeing is believing, I believe we've been seeing.SEANA SMITH: There we go. Lots of fans have been waiting quite some time for that. The third season of ""Ted Lasso"" starts streaming on Apple TV+ on March 15, just about a month away. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal is here with us. Allie, lots of people are excited. The person to the right of me is very excited for this. What can we expect?ALLIE CANAL: Oh, yes, and I've had multiple people over the past year, year and a half, come up to me and say, do you know when ""Ted Lasso"" comes out?DAVE BRIGGS: 17 months, man.ALLIE CANAL: I know. October 2021--DAVE BRIGGS: Geez.ALLIE CANAL: --was when we last saw this show. And finally, it is back. It's going to be released on Wednesday, March 15, as you said. First three episodes available on that premiere day and then will be released once a week on Wednesdays this time. The last time we saw the show, they released it on Fridays.So it's the first Apple TV series to premiere and debut mid-week, but it's just one of those shows that it's adored by fans. It's adored by critics. It won multiple Emmys for Best Comedy, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress. So I think fans are just excited to finally see this show return. But Seana, as you and I were talking about, sometimes, it takes too long for these shows--SEANA SMITH: Yes, way too long.ALLIE CANAL: --especially with the binge model. You binge it all, and then all of a sudden, you don't get a new season for two years. And you forget everything that happened in the seasons prior. So I'm on YouTube, trying to look up the synopsis of what happened the past two seasons. And I do think that's sort of risky. And you could lose some viewers that way.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: With the ""Shrinking"" show, this will be my two favorite shows on TV, both on Apple TV.SEANA SMITH: Wow.DAVE BRIGGS: Because ""Shrinking"" and ""Ted Lasso,"" terrific. They are out of the gate. Speaking of Apple, they had the halftime show. We have some fresh numbers from the Super Bowl and the Apple Music halftime show. How many tuned in?ALLIE CANAL: So for the Super Bowl-- and I, unfortunately, am an Eagles fan, so I watched the whole game, loved the whole game up until the very last minute. But I was not alone. 113 million folks tuned in to watch this game, the third biggest TV program of all time, behind the 2017 and 2015 Super Bowls. But it really was that halftime show with Rihanna that gathered the most viewers. Nearly 119 million people tuned in to watch this, the second highest rated halftime show right behind Katy Perry. I'm curious to hear your guys' thoughts on what you thought of Rihanna and her performance.SEANA SMITH: So I liked it. I love a lot of her songs. I thought it met some of the hype out there. To be honest, I didn't love it. It was far from my favorite halftime show.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm so relieved to hear you say that because Rihanna fans will come for you, man.SEANA SMITH: Oh, I know.DAVE BRIGGS: They are--ALLIE CANAL: And they already have. There's already TikToks saying--DAVE BRIGGS: I thought it was--ALLIE CANAL: --she was pregnant, this and that. And it's--SEANA SMITH: Certainly drummed up a lot-- yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: She was pregnant. That's what I saw.SEANA SMITH: That's amazing.DAVE BRIGGS: It was a very average performance. It was very obvious she was lip syncing everything. I don't know. I was not moved by it, other than the fact that she plugged her company. I thought it was just OK.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and I read a headline saying that instead of chaos, she chose to be very sleek and simple, in some ways. I can respect that because I do think the halftime show has become this spectacle. But I was disappointed that there were no guest performers. That's like one of the things missing.DAVE BRIGGS: Yes, there was. It was her unborn child.ALLIE CANAL: Well, if you count her unborn child. But I mean, she has so many great performers that have been featured on her songs. I was expecting that. I was expecting a little bit more. And again, like you said, Dave, I know people are going to come for me for that because they are very protective. And I love Rihanna. Don't get me wrong. She looked amazing. The few times that I did hear her sing, like, she sounds amazing. I hope that comes with a tour or something soon, but for now.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but you also got to give her a lot of credit. When I was pregnant-- I've been pregnant twice.ALLIE CANAL: Absolutely.SEANA SMITH: I wouldn't be getting up on one of those things suspended all the way in the air, let alone performing--DAVE BRIGGS: No doubt.SEANA SMITH: --in front of more than 100 million people. So, in that regard--ALLIE CANAL: And what a way, what a way to announce your pregnancy.SEANA SMITH: Oh, my God.ALLIE CANAL: So I mean--SEANA SMITH: Incredible.ALLIE CANAL: --it is iconic in that way.SEANA SMITH: Certainly is.DAVE BRIGGS: No doubt.]"

Tubi's new research highlights the explosive growth in Connected TV (CTV) ad spend, while ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) services lead the streaming pack as consumers look to cut subscription costs in the year ahead.""As subscription costs continue to rise, nearly 1 in 3 streamers plan to reduce spending on streaming services this year,"" said Mark Rotblat, Chief Revenue Officer, Tubi. ""With consumers turning to AVOD to complement the select SVOD services they choose to keep, Tubi offers a brand-safe environment for advertisers looking to tap into an incremental, young, diverse, and highly engaged streaming audience.""Tubi's Total Viewing Time (TVT) is up 44% year-over-year (2022 calendar year vs 2021), with more than 5 billion hours streamed in 2022, and the platform audience has grown surpassing 64 million monthly active users. Tubi's audience continues to be young and increasingly diverse, African American and LGBT audiences grew over 50% in 2022, and audience growth exceeded 25% in each major level of household income and the Hispanic demo - according to MRI. Additionally, Tubi's core younger demographic remains strong - more than 1 in 3 (36%) Tubi streamers are between the ages of 18 and 34. Tubi is proud to offer consumers free access to more than 50,000 titles from 455 content partners as well as a growing curated FAST offering watched by  1 in 5 AVOD streamers in the past 12 months.The full report can be downloaded here and highlights are below:Story continuesKey Industry Trends: Cord cutting continues and CTV ad spend is on the rise: 3 out of 4 consumers agree that AVODs are a practical alternative to cable and satellite TV. As CTV advertising continues to grow, funding isn't just coming from linear budgets - this year significant digital video, social media, OOH, and traditional media dollars shifted to CTV.SVODs curbing password sharing may increase churn: 35% of streamers access other people's digital video streaming services and 45% of streamers want to stream without having an account. SVODs aim to curb these losses by charging accounts shared across multiple households, which is expected to increase churn.Effective content and recommendations drive viewer satisfaction: Tubi identified five types of streamers in its research. From ""recommendation seekers"" to ""genre-focused browsers,"" they all share the same 3 drivers of satisfaction: ""a good mix"" of content, effective recommendations, and seamless navigation. When it comes to ease of use, the bar is higher for AVOD - 34% of streamers expect ease of use in SVODs while it jumps to 59% for FAST/AVOD.Viewers prefer light ad loads and standard ad formats: 51% of streamers are satisfied with 6 minutes of ads per hour. While streaming services experiment with new ad formats, Tubi found that standard video ads are currently preferred by streamers over other formats such as split screen, interactive, or QR code ads.Diverse and unreachable audiences drive AVOD spend: As advertisers evaluate the state of streaming TV, more ad dollars are being dedicated to streaming buys than ever before - 4 out of 5 advertisers now regard advertising on streaming television as highly valuable. Growth in monthly active users, the presence of otherwise hard to reach young and multicultural streamers, and the ability to reach hard to find audiences were cited as key drivers for AVOD ad spend.About the Data: Tubi commissioned survey research with leading industry insights providers. In Q1 2022, Tubi surveyed 3,000+ US pop who stream an hour or more a week with Qualtrics. In Q3 2022, Tubi surveyed 2,000 AVOD and SVOD streamers with Magid and 4,500 general streamers with Marketcast. All of this data was utilized to better understand the streaming landscape of 2022. Tubi also analyzed a number of first-party and third-party data sources, including a combination of MRI and self-reported data. About TubiTubi, Fox Corporation's ad-supported video-on-demand service, has over 50,000 movies and TV shows, including a growing library of Tubi Originals, 200+ local and live news and sports channels, and 455 entertainment partners, featuring content from every major Hollywood studio.

290,08e49c40-e819-33c1-8fb9-7620771c15cc,EXC,2023-02-15,12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-profitable-utility-stocks-180230715.html,1676397750,STORY,"['WEC', 'ES', 'XEL', 'PCGU', 'ED', 'AWK', 'EXCVV', 'DUK']","[In this article, we take a look at 12 most profitable utility stocks now. If you want to see more most profitable utility stocks now, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now.In this article, we discuss utility companies in the United States.Utility companies provide essential services such as electricity, natural gas, and water.Given how essential the services are, many utility companies in the U.S. are regulated by the government in the United States. In exchange for providing services, many regulated utilities can get a return on their rate base decided by regulators.Sometimes the return on their rate base is better than expected. Sometimes the return on their rate base is worse than expected.S&amp;P Global explains rate base,A utility's rate base is essentially the company's ""prudent"" capital investment, as determined by the applicable regulatory authority’s net of accumulated depreciation. Stated differently, it is the net asset base from which the utility provides electric, gas or water service, and upon which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, usually the company's weighted average cost of capital. Thus, the rate base value is a key variable in the determination of a utility's revenue requirement.While there are many utilities that are regulated in the United States, there are also many deregulated utilities or unregulated utilities in the United States that don't get a return on their rate base, however, as competition ultimately decides how well they do.Regulations are also different in countries outside of the United States as every country is different in terms of how they regulate their utilities.Renewable EnergyGiven the need to invest in new renewable energy infrastructure to meet emission regulations, some leading regulated utilities have increased their rate base as a result. The increase in their rate base has allowed them to increase earnings.In terms of green energy, electric utility companies have also faced more competition as rooftop solar adoption has increased and increasing heat pumps adoption has also represented competition for natural gas companies. The effect of the competition is different for each utility, however, depending on whether a utility is regulated or deregulated, the effect of the regulations, and many other factors. In the long term, utilities may need to innovate to adjust to the changes. In the near term, however, many of the leading regulated utilities do have EPS growth potential if regulators allow them to grow their earnings.Story continuesAlthough leading regulated utility companies do have earnings growth potential in the near term, events like wildfires like what occurred to PG&amp;E could affect the utility's value and the industry does face more competition in the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in 2022. As a result, U.S. treasury yields have increased considerably and substantial capital has moved from leading equities into the U.S. Treasury market. The capital outflow has decreased valuations for many stocks including many utilities.michaeljung/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now, we took the 15 most valuable utilities in the United States by market capitalization and we ranked them by the amount of net income (TTM) they had according to YCharts.Of the 15, we took the top 12.Because some companies have not posted their earnings results for Q4, the trailing twelve months for different companies might not be the same time frames as some could end in September 30 and some could end in December 31. Because we used YCharts data, the net income might not be adjusted income either.12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now12. American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE:AWK)Net Income (TTM) as of September 30, 2022: $1.318 billionAmerican Water Works Company, Inc.

Although Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES)'s net income has increased, the utility's stock has declined 5.2% in the last year as the rising Treasury yields have led to some lower valuations for leading dividend companies.10.

If you want to see more most profitable bank stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In.Many big banks did not do well during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Given home values decreased substantially in 2008, some financial institutions that made riskier loans lost a lot of money. Considering the economy slowed substantially in 2008, even more financial institutions lost a lot of money as well. With the slowing economy, leading investment bank Lehman Brothers eventually went bankrupt, and the government had to eventually bail out some of the big banks.As a result of the financial crisis, some big banks were labeled as systemically important, meaning their failure could lead to instability in the financial system.Although shareholders of systematically important institutions could still lose all their money if the institution failed, the government placed more regulation on those systemically important institutions and as a result, many of the big banks had to have more capital than before that weighed on their profitability.Nevertheless, big banks have done well over the last ten years given the growing U.S. economy even though there has been some dips due to market declines or the pandemic. Many U.S. banks have also benefited from higher interest rates. Many banks find it easier to make more in net interest margin when interest rates are a little higher than when they are near zero.Although interest rates have risen substantially in 2022, many big bank stocks did not do well, however.One reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also led to a considerable increase in U.S. Treasury yields. As a result of substantially higher Treasury yields, a lot of capital moved from the equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and many leading equity stock valuations decreased as a result.Another reason is that the substantial rise in interest rates also increased the chance of a recession. If there is a recession, bank loan losses could increase and this could lead to lower than expected profits or even losses that might send their stocks lower.Story continuesWhile inflation has shown signs of having potentially peaked last year, many expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. If it raises rates too much further, the odds of a recession or an economic slowdown that might send bank stocks lower will increase.Given some companies might underperform or the economy could worsen, leading bank stocks might not achieve their potential. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.kmichal/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In, we took the 10 largest banks by market capitalization in the United States and ranked them based on the amount of TTM net income they had according to YCharts.Because we used YCharts data, the net income data might not be adjusted earnings.10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks To Invest In10.

I'm not merely rocking red shoes because it's Valentine's Day. No, it's because the retailer, Under Armour, today opened a pop-up store on Fifth Ave in New York City centered around these babies. This is Under Armour's new $150 sneaker/slip. So what's the key here? The key is how the heel folds down. If you can see, the heel folds up, and then folds right back down, and it becomes a slide after you're done working out. Yeah, it is both a slide and a shoe.Founder Kevin Plank saying at a launch party last night, we have not yet built our defining product, but this comes close. The sneakers also offer the BOA wheel tightening cable system that eliminates the need to tie laces. That appeals to the young kids. New CEO Stephanie Linnartz will start in less than two weeks after 25 years at Marriott. She'll have her hands full.Shares are up 6% this year, down 37% over the last 12 months and really flat today. I got to tell you, I put them on initially and was bothered by folding the heel down. But I wore them all day and forgot it was there. And so now it has become a really convenient-- they're not aiming at 46-year-old dads. I think they're aiming at my teenage kids, who I think this will really appeal.SEANA SMITH: That's what I was just going to say. I don't know if you're exactly the target demo.DAVE BRIGGS: No.SEANA SMITH: You were very-- I was next to you. You were very, very skeptical when you first put it on. I think it makes a lot of sense, especially if you are targeting those teenagers. You remember-- I remember when I was much younger, I would try to fit my foot into shoes all the time without having to reach down because I was simply lazy. So it makes a lot of sense. I think this could potentially be a hit for teens and for those in their early 20s. I don't know about that red color. I love it for Valentine's Day.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Well, it's Valentine's Day, man.SEANA SMITH: I know. I like that you're rocking the red there, but I don't know. It's certainly not the next it product.DAVE BRIGGS: They've got white, yellow, black, and a pink version--SEANA SMITH: I would try it. What about you?DAVE BRIGGS: --as well.ALLIE CANAL: I think teens, yes, I agree. One, if you're working out in that and then sliding it in, doesn't the shoe get smelly? I mean, I don't know.SEANA SMITH: They're washable.ALLIE CANAL: They're washable?DAVE BRIGGS: They are machine washable.ALLIE CANAL: OK, all right. You know, I could see--DAVE BRIGGS: But yes, they do get smelly.ALLIE CANAL: Yes, I was going to say, because I know my sneakers, I have very specific sneakers for each thing that I do.

As organizations look to address the diverse infrastructure and network capabilities across markets, while decreasing costs and increasing agility through multi-cloud and open-source architectures, there are tremendous growth opportunities with the cloud,"" said Parimal Pandya, Senior Vice President, Sales, and Managing Director, Asia-Pacific.In building out Akamai Connected Cloud, Akamai is adding core and distributed sites on top of the same underlying backbone that powers its edge network today — spanning more than 4,100 locations across 134 countries. More specifically, Akamai is placing compute, storage, database, and other services closer to large populations, industry, and IT centers. The result is designed to be a continuum of compute, from core to edge, enabling companies to more efficiently build, deploy, and secure performant workloads that require single-digit millisecond latency and global reach. Industries such as media, gaming, SaaS vendors, retail, and government are examples where these requirements are in high demand today.""Akamai's leadership position at the edge enables us to scale everything we touch: We scale content, putting digital experiences closer to users than anyone. We scale cybersecurity, keeping threats farther away from business and people. Our customers know us and trust us for this scale. Now we plan to scale cloud computing, to provide customers with better performance at a lower cost,"" said Leighton.According to IDC, the public cloud services market in Asia/Pacific is forecasted to reach USD$165.2 billion in 20261, and one in three companies has been predicted to generate more than 30% of their revenues2 from digital products and services in 2023.""The cloud's next phase requires a shift in how developers and enterprises think about getting applications and data closer to their customers. It redefines how the industry looks at things like performance, scale, cost, and security as workloads are no longer built for one place but are delivered across a wide spectrum of compute and geography,"" said Dave McCarthy, Research VP, IDC. ""Akamai's innovative rethinking of how this gets done — and how it is architecting the Akamai Connected Cloud — puts it in a unique position to usher in an exciting new era for technology and to help enterprises build, deploy, and secure distributed applications.""Akamai is already enabling regional customers to manage decentralised application architectures and deliver consistent experiences across their regional operations.Rajkumar Ganapathy, Chief Technology Officer, Zolvit, said, ""One of our key goals was to consolidate our infrastructure for better management, flexibility and to save costs. We were looking for a single cloud provider that aligned with all our requirements and Akamai Connected Cloud was our preferred choice because of their simple, affordable, and accessible infrastructure and superior support that put our team at ease.""Akamai Connected Cloud is under the leadership of Adam Karon, Chief Operating Officer, and General Manager of Akamai's Cloud Technology Group, where he has led teams focused on enabling today's leading media, gaming, and software companies to deliver the best possible experiences — at scale — to their customers on any device, anywhere, and helping carriers operate high-performing and cost-efficient networks.""Cloud is a stepping stone to solving larger business challenges,"" said Karon. ""Business leaders are looking to continue the momentum of digital transformation and stretch the boundaries of what's possible for their organizations in an increasingly digital world. Our distributed scale is designed to deliver highly-performant cloud computing everywhere our customers' business connects online, empowering them with the speed, flexibility, performance, and connectivity they need to grow without compromise, innovate without friction, and delight customers without fail.""For more information, visit our cloud computing solutions page.About Akamai TechnologiesAkamai powers and protects life online.

This compares to earnings of $1.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.87%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cloud services provider would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.26, delivering a surprise of 2.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Akamai Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $927.78 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $905.36 million.

It has encountered approximately 118 feet of high-quality net oil pay in the Campano-Maastrichtian reservoir. The deposit could hold more than 200 million barrels of oil in reserves.APA and TotalEnergies are partners in the project, with TotalEnergies serving as the operator. APA Suriname holds a 50% working interest in Block 58 while TotalEnergies holds the remaining 50%.The success of offshore drilling in Suriname is being watched closely, given the massive discoveries made offshore neighboring Guyana. Suriname could potentially produce 650,000 barrels per day by 2030, with first oil flow expected in 2025.According to John J. Christmann IV, the CEO and president of APA Corporation, the results from the drilling and flow tests of the Sapakara South-2 appraisal well are consistent with their pre-drill expectations, confirming their geological, geophysical, and reservoir models. He also stated that the successful drilling and flow testing has added substantial resources toward a potential development. APA is focused on drilling two appraisal wells at the Krabdagu discovery, which is about 17 kilometers east of Sapakara.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHouston-based APA Corporation is a leading independent energy company with operations in Egypt, the United States, and the U.K., as well as offshore Suriname and other international locations.

306,97c286cf-ccb8-3de7-a424-5ed360785a5f,CL,2023-02-15,Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ray-dalio-stock-portfolio-top-173110973.html,1676395870,STORY,"['ABT', 'COST', 'MDLZ', 'MCD', 'PFE', 'PDD', 'V', 'PEP', 'CL', 'SBUX', 'PG', 'JNJ']","[In this piece, we will take a look at Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks. For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc.

Could the Peacock and basketball league get back into business together again?Video Transcript- One thing that I'm watching, though, is Comcast. Shares are trading relatively flat today after a new CNBC report claimed NBC Sports is preparing to make a bid to win back NBA broadcasting rights more than two decades after the network lost those rights to Disney and Turner Sports.And this is important because Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery, that owns Turner, they have not yet waived their exclusive negotiation window, so no formal discussions are taking place at this time. But I think it's an interesting story to think about how these streaming services and how the onset of streaming has really upended a lot of these negotiations.And you wonder if the NBA, instead of just partnering with one or two media partners, maybe they could partner with three or four. Will these platforms like that? Probably not. But you have to wonder--- --much a choice.- They might not have a choice. And especially what we've seen with the NFL, Amazon, the YouTube deal, everything's a little different than it was a decade ago.- It's been so long since the NBC had the NBA. I don't-- were you guys old enough to remember OJ? We were watching the NBA finals when the OJ chase--- It's been, like, 20 years.- You probably don't even recall this.- Yeah. It's been a long time.- I can't see this, in particular because the streaming element of it-- Peacock has, what? 20 million subs, in comparison to WBD has access if TNT Turner re-ups, which we all assume they will because they are so deeply vested. It is ingrained in everything they do there. They have 95 million subs.I just think Amazon or Apple is a given here, [? Ali. ?] One of them will be in on this. Not the entire package, but some portion of it. The NBA saw what happened with the NFL. They know that they can reach a younger demo. They know they can get a huge number from one of those. You have to figure they're in on it, and then somebody like a WBD. What's your best bet? Sorry to put you on the spot.Story continues- I do agree that after we saw all everything with YouTube and Google, and especially with all these legacy media giants pulling back a lot of their spending. Bob Iger on the last earnings call, he said, look, we love the NBA. We love ESPN. But we are going to be a lot more selective with the types of sports rights that we want to commit to.So that does make me think that some of these tech giants could be a little ahead in the race there in order to strike--- Yeah, it was interesting how people interpreted that one line by Iger because he said that he has enjoyed having the NBA. Some people were saying, oh, they're all in. They're going to want to renew that exclusivity. Others saying, hey, maybe they'll relinquish that, and we'll see more of these players come into this space.- How does Iger cut costs? And they're talking about $50 to $75 billion to get this deal, so it's going to be really a fascinating story to watch. But still, April 24, to [? Ali's ?] point.]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.27 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Devon Energy shares have added about 3.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.8%.What's Next for Devon Energy?While Devon Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

We're looking at gains of nearly 10% here in extended trading, a solid report here from the company, as the demand for travel certainly looks like it's here to stay, at least for now.Taking a look at this quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line. Also issued strong guidance for the current quarter right now. In the shareholder letter, Airbnb writing that it sees strong demand in Q1, and the consumer is confident to travel. That confidence remains very high.Over the last three months, we're looking at gains of just about 14% year to date. The stock has certainly been off to a very strong start of the year. We're seeing that reflected in a number of these travel names since January 1. You're looking at gains of just about 41%.Tripadvisor, another stock that has been off to the races since the start of the year. We're looking at a pop in after hours, up just over 8% right now, another strong beat from this company. And we're looking at a beat here on both the top and bottom lines of revenue for its most recent quarter, jumping 47% from just a year ago.Their [INAUDIBLE] marketplace clearly has been a driver here in these recent results. That business helping to drive some of those stronger than expected numbers that we're getting from Tripadvisor, up nearly 40% since the start of the year over the last three months. So a little bit of a longer term chart there, up nearly 17%.Kicking it over to Devon Energy. That stock under a bit of pressure here, off just about 5% in extended trading. The company's 2023 CapEx forecasts missing the Street's estimates. Free cash flow here in line with expectations at $1.1 billion.The company also, the board here approving an 11% increase to its fixed quarterly dividend. Over the last three months you're looking at losses of nearly 11%. But over the last year, that stock is clearly in the green, up just about 22%.And rounding it out here with GoDaddy. That stock off just over 1% here in after hours trading. Revenue just a bit light, $1.04 billion. The Street was looking for $1.05 billion. EPS missed though, full year 2023 revenue also coming in just a bit light over the last year. Stock has been essentially flat. But taking a look at the last three months or so, you can still see that the company has been able to gain back some of that momentum with shares up just about 10%.]"

(NYSE:YUM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 80% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-inc-nyse-yum-110057931.html,1676458857,STORY,['YUM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Yum! Brands. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Yum! Brands?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Yum! Brands. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Yum! Brands' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Yum! Brands is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Yum! BrandsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Yum! Brands, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$35m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Yum! Brands (including 2 which are concerning) .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 7, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.09 a share.DKS has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.97%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86.DKS is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Yum Brands (YUM).Slated to report earnings on May 3, 2023, Yum Brands holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.14 a share 78 days from its next quarterly update.Yum Brands' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.26% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, DKS and YUM could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The fast food giant is introducing its first celebrity duo meal with lifelong McDonald's fans Cardi B and Offset. Starting today, fans of the rappers can pick up the duo meals at restaurants across the country. Cardi B's part of the meal is a classic McDonald's cheeseburger, tangy barbecue sauce on the side, and a large Coke. Offset gets a quarter pounder with cheese and a large orange Hi-C-- I love that. And to share, a large fries and an apple pie. All right, Seana, what would be the Seana Smith combo?SEANA SMITH: So my combo would be-- I love their crispy chicken sandwich. They have a spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I'm going to go with that, a large fries. We're not splitting. It's going to be all to myself-- and a Diet Coke. What would yours be? And barbecue sauce on the side--DAVE BRIGGS: That's amazing.SEANA SMITH: --for the fries.DAVE BRIGGS: My wife won't share with me either. Easily got to be the sausage McGriddle, egg, and cheese. I know it's not available at dinner, but for Valentine's, you could do me a favor. Definitely go with some fries, and I need a Shamrock Shake, which is back in the store February 20. Shamrock Shakes are underrated.SEANA SMITH: And it's incredible how smart and how successful McDonald's has been with these pairings, with these promotions. Time and time again, they have teamed up with a number of celebrities in the past. And a lot of their favorite meals sell out pretty quickly, and they're no longer able to offer those. We know Shamrock, obviously, is a milkshake that they offer every year around St. Patrick's Day. It's a huge hit. You don't want to look at how many calories are in this drink because you're going to think twice maybe about drinking it the next time. But they're so, so good. The limited releases, you can't argue with them.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, the Travis Scott meal--SEANA SMITH: Yes, that's the one.DAVE BRIGGS: --I think was several months ago that was a huge hit. This one actually threw me off because Offset I didn't know was a person. I thought it was--SEANA SMITH: You didn't? Cardi and Offset-- come on, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: I thought it was a type of meal, an offset, like, you know, like a financial term. I'm still learning. I'm still coming around to pop culture. But I want to know who's going to McDonald's for Valentine's. That's the real question. Are you getting points for that?SEANA SMITH: I think you're getting points for that, and it's better than my plans. I have no plans for Valentine's Day. So McDonald's? I think it looks like a pretty good option. But we will see.DAVE BRIGGS: I'll take my wife there.]"

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

333,6cbda4ed-126d-31ed-9a93-3c352fa43e83,PLD,2023-02-15,Amazon Buying Its Own Warehouse Space: Will That Hurt Industrial REITs?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-buying-own-warehouse-space-171054269.html,1676394654,STORY,"['AMZN', 'PLD', 'STAG', 'ILPT']","[The COVID-19 pandemic greatly changed the way Americans shopped. Online purchases soar as people stayed home in fear of going into malls or stand-alone stores. Suddenly, companies like Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) found themselves needing additional warehouse space to store and ship out customer merchandise.Amazon doubled its warehouse space from pre-COVID levels and became a significant tenant for several industrial REIT landlords. By the end of 2022, Amazon was leasing approximately 392 million square feet of warehouse space across North America.But Amazon’s leasing expansion has mostly come to a halt now that the company has started purchasing its own warehouse space. By the end of 2022, Amazon had increased its ownership of warehouse and distribution space to 22 million square feet.The share price of several industrial REITs declined more than 25% in the spring of 2022 after Amazon stated it would be cutting its logistics network costs due to an oversupply of warehouse space. This was interpreted by Wall Street to mean that Amazon will continue giving up its leased space.If this trend continues, how will that affect the industrial REITs that have Amazon as a large tenant? Amazon CEO Andy Jassy previously stated that Amazon is trying to become ""more efficient"" with its warehouse portfolio and has recently begun subleasing some of its space to other companies.Below are three industrial REITs that could lose significant revenue if Amazon decides to pull the plug on leasing for good:Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages 4,914 industrial logistics properties from New York to California and in 18 other countries. During Prologis’ second quarter 2022 conference call, Chief Customer Officer Mike Curless was asked about Amazon’s announcement that it would be unloading a great deal of leased space because of overcapacity. Curless responded that Prologis was 99% occupied in areas where Amazon was leasing space and that existing rents were 54% below market, so finding new tenants would not be difficult should Amazon terminate its leases.Story continuesAt the time of Curless’ comment, Amazon was renting about 33.4 million square feet from Prologis, almost 5% of Prologis’ total net effective rent. While finding new tenants could be easy, there is often significant expense and lost revenue from the time a large tenant leaves until a new tenant moves in. New build outs, carrying costs and rent incentives could significantly impact Prologis’ bottom line.Stag Industrial Inc. (NYSE: STAG) is a Dallas-based industrial REIT that owns 111.6 million square feet in 563 properties across 41 states.At the end of 2022, Amazon was Stag Industrial’s largest tenant, renting seven warehouses and accounting for 3.2% of its annualized base revenue.Another issue for stag could be other large companies following Amazon’s lead and start buying warehouses. As 2022 ended, about 40% of Stag Industrial’s leased space was to e-commerce companies. While its tenant portfolio is well diversified with 45 industries across 60 markets, Stag Industrial’s risk of tenant loss would seem to be greater than that of Prologis.Industrial Logistics Properties Trust (NYSE: ILPT) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based industrial REIT that owns 60 million square feet of space in 413 industrial and logistics properties across 39 states. Its website reports that it has a 99.2% property occupancy rate, which is extremely high for a REIT.As of September 2022, Amazon was providing Industrial Logistics with 6.8% of its annualized rental revenue, the largest percentage of any REIT leasing space to Amazon. Industrial Logistics already has a major debt problem resulting from its February 2022 acquisition of Monmouth Realty Trust and its $323 million of debt. The acquisition forced Industrial Logistics to slash its quarterly dividend from $0.33 per share in April to $0.01 per share in July.Industrial Logistics’ share price has been in a downward spiral ever since the dividend cut was announced, falling from over $22 a year ago to a recent price of $4.19.

This compares to loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 220%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this travel website operator would post earnings of $0.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -28.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.TripAdvisor , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $354 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $241 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.TripAdvisor shares have added about 35.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.8%.What's Next for TripAdvisor?While TripAdvisor has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TripAdvisor: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.09 on $367.21 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.26 on $1.73 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 19% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Travelzoo (TZOO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This global media commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +148%.

We have four stocks for you to keep an eye on. Kicking it off with Airbnb. We're looking at gains of nearly 10% here in extended trading, a solid report here from the company, as the demand for travel certainly looks like it's here to stay, at least for now.Taking a look at this quarter, they beat on both the top and bottom line. Also issued strong guidance for the current quarter right now. In the shareholder letter, Airbnb writing that it sees strong demand in Q1, and the consumer is confident to travel. That confidence remains very high.Over the last three months, we're looking at gains of just about 14% year to date. The stock has certainly been off to a very strong start of the year. We're seeing that reflected in a number of these travel names since January 1. You're looking at gains of just about 41%.Tripadvisor, another stock that has been off to the races since the start of the year. We're looking at a pop in after hours, up just over 8% right now, another strong beat from this company. And we're looking at a beat here on both the top and bottom lines of revenue for its most recent quarter, jumping 47% from just a year ago.Their [INAUDIBLE] marketplace clearly has been a driver here in these recent results. That business helping to drive some of those stronger than expected numbers that we're getting from Tripadvisor, up nearly 40% since the start of the year over the last three months. So a little bit of a longer term chart there, up nearly 17%.Kicking it over to Devon Energy. That stock under a bit of pressure here, off just about 5% in extended trading. The company's 2023 CapEx forecasts missing the Street's estimates. Free cash flow here in line with expectations at $1.1 billion.The company also, the board here approving an 11% increase to its fixed quarterly dividend. Over the last three months you're looking at losses of nearly 11%. But over the last year, that stock is clearly in the green, up just about 22%.And rounding it out here with GoDaddy. That stock off just over 1% here in after hours trading. Revenue just a bit light, $1.04 billion. The Street was looking for $1.05 billion. EPS missed though, full year 2023 revenue also coming in just a bit light over the last year. Stock has been essentially flat. But taking a look at the last three months or so, you can still see that the company has been able to gain back some of that momentum with shares up just about 10%.]"

So first, just your reaction to the numbers that we're getting from Airbnb.TOM WHITE: Yeah, look, they look pretty solid. It looks like a pretty clean quarter, as you remarked. A little bit of upside on revenue and EBITDA in the fourth quarter. And the revenue guidance for the first quarter is particularly strong. The low end of the range that they're guiding to is actually above where the Street is. So it sounds like some of the commentary we heard from Expedia around a really nice kind of snapback in travel in January is kind of extending here to Airbnb. And also, the guidance on EBITDA for the quarter was above the Street, too.And I think the other main takeaway, too, is, they made some comments in the letter about margins for calendar 2023 basically being in line with 2022 levels. I think some investors worry that as kind of the economy reopens, people start going back into physical offices and doing corporate travel, that expenses, operating expenses, might tick up for some of these companies, but it sounds like Airbnb is going to be able to hold margins steady.DAVE BRIGGS: Just an insatiable appetite to travel, Tom. Is there any concern-- and let's stay with Airbnb before we move over to trip-- 88.2 million nights. The estimate was for 90 million. And the other one that jumps out-- and maybe it's just me-- 900,000 more listings on Airbnb at the end of '22 than they had at the beginning. At some point, is there just oversaturation?TOM WHITE: Yeah, look, so on room nights, maybe a little bit light versus consensus, but still growing room nights significantly at a faster clip than some of the big, other kind of more traditional online travel brands. We think that just reflects the fact that Airbnb was able to use the pandemic as just this great opportunity to acquire a whole new cohort of customers that had never used the platform before. Those people, we think, will be sticky customers over the long-term.Story continuesAnd then, secondarily, just vacation rentals in general continues to be the best performing kind of pocket of the market. Airbnb has got the most geographically diverse inventory hits. All of the use cases, including some new ones that some of the other traditional OTAs maybe struggle to participate in, like work from anywhere or these long-term stays, right? 20% of Airbnb's room nights are for something like 28 days or more. So, still very strong growth, even if it fell maybe a smidge short of consensus.On hosts, you know, I think there's a tailwind here from kind of what's happening in the broader macro, right? You've got mounting kind of inflationary pressure, and then some macro pressures. We think that's going to be a tailwind for supply. It'll be interesting to see how Airbnb balances that big spike in supply and make sure that there's enough demand to satisfy all of those new hosts. But that's something that we'll have to keep an eye on for this year.SEANA SMITH: Tom, lots of talk just about the economic conditions, the risk that that might bring here for Airbnb. Any indication-- and it doesn't look like from these numbers, just at first glance, that consumers are trading down, that they're opting for some of those cheaper options, given the current economic climate.TOM WHITE: Yeah, so far, so good. If inflation kind of remains persistently high, you know, that won't last forever. But at least so far, it doesn't seem to be eating into the underlying desire for folks to travel. We've seen a lot of the data out there around services related spending by consumers being a lot stronger than spending on goods. We think that bodes well for all of these travel guys.I'd also keep in mind, too, that the vacation rental space, generally speaking, even though rates and ADRs have kind of gone up in this category like traditional hotels, we still think this is a significantly cheaper option when compared to kind of a comparable kind of traditional hotel stay. So it's not exactly value, given the fact that ADRs have kind of gone up so much over the last couple of years, but still represents, I think, a really strong value when people are evaluating travel.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, quickly, I want to get your take on Trip. The numbers there reporting, their stock also popping as well. Investors like what they see. How much is Viator, which has really been leading the way for them? And what did you see here that stood out?TOM WHITE: Yeah, so still kind of going through the press release there, but yeah, obviously, the headline kind of revenue beat was solid, and same on the bottom line. You know, that sort of changes a little bit of the MO for these guys over the last few quarters. Last few quarters, Tripadvisor has been outperforming on EBITDA and doing really well at cutting costs and staying disciplined, but the revenues have kind of underwhelmed a little bit. Nice to see them beat on-- beat expectations on revenue.We think Viator continues to be a really strong contributor. We also just think that kind of nice, robust recovery in travel is just kind of a rising tide that's lifting a lot of boats here. And with Tripadvisor, they also guided to basically flat kind of margins year over year in calendar '23. I think the institutional investor community is responding positively to that.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Tom White, DA Davidson, good stuff. Thank you, sir.TOM WHITE: Thank you.DAVE BRIGGS: Be sure to stick around tonight around 5:30 Eastern time as Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith will recap Airbnb's earnings call and breaking out everything you need to know and what they hear from CEO Brian Chesky.

You're looking at gains of just about 5% for its most recent quarter here. The company beating on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue, 354 million. The estimate on the Street was for 343.7 billion. That's a jump of 47% year over year. Adjusted EPS of $0.16. That's also a beat there. In terms of what the Street was expecting, $0.16. The estimate was for just $0.04, so a solid beat there for adjusted EPS.Also, Tripadvisor, their stock-based compensation for the quarter coming in at 23 million. That was essentially in line with expectations. The estimate on the Street was for 22.9 million. But again, it beat on both the top and bottom line here, Dave. And really, we can gather from these results from Tripadvisor and what we just heard from Airbnb, clearly, there is strong demand out there for travel.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, I'm going to go back to what we actually heard this morning to explain both of these two, and that's from Marriott CEO Tony Capuano, who said demand for leisure travel topped pre-pandemic levels. And the number that really astounded me here from Tony was that business travel is near 90% recovered from pre-pandemic levels. Most thought we were around 60% or 70% pre-pandemic levels when it comes to business travel.If we're back at 90%, you're looking at stocks across the board anywhere near, anywhere touching travel, showing just enormous appetite and no loss of demand from the consumer. Look at the cruise stocks. Everything has consistently been popped in the last couple of weeks with the exception of, what, Expedia might be the only one I can think of in the entire industry. Everyone's showing just that huge appetite to travel.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Expedia blaming the bad weather that we saw in the fourth quarter. A lot of it had to do with the winter storm, also hurricane there, that that is the reason why their results were affected. But in terms of their guidance, they were even pretty optimistic about what they're seeing in the current quarter, very similar to what we heard from Airbnb.]"

See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to reported earnings from operations under GAAP.4 Earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, excludes the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates, acquisition and integration expenses, an increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting and the nonrecurring gain on the divestiture of the Company’s Colorado and Texas ready mixed concrete operations as of April 1, 2022, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta.5 Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations excludes an increase in cost of revenues from the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting, acquisition and integration expenses, and the nonrecurring gain on the divestiture of the Company's Colorado and Texas ready mixed concrete operations as of April 1, 2022, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix to this earnings release for a reconciliation to reported earnings per diluted share under GAAP.Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “2022 marked our Company’s eleventh consecutive year delivering increased products and services revenues, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as our most profitable year ever. We achieved record financial results and world-class safety incidence rates while also seamlessly integrating a large platform acquisition and completing non-core asset divestitures against a backdrop of rapid monetary tightening, a resulting housing slowdown, and cost inflation at 40-year highs. These accomplishments are a testament to our team’s disciplined execution of our strategic plan and unyielding focus on what we can control. Moreover, in a notably weather-impacted fourth quarter, our team nonetheless expanded aggregates margins and increased gross profit per shipped ton by 25 percent over the prior-year quarter. These successes were underscored by an all-time quarterly record of aggregates pricing growth and position our Company well to deliver another record year in 2023.Story continues“Entering 2023, near-term product demand visibility is supported by healthy customer backlogs driven by an acceleration in public infrastructure investment and announced large-scale energy and domestic manufacturing projects. While single-family residential construction is slowing, we expect a resumption of growth in this end market in Martin Marietta markets beyond 2023 as population growth continues and mortgage rates stabilize. In total, we expect full year 2023 aggregates shipments to be relatively flat but, given the carryover effects of our 2022 commercial actions and broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 price increases, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver accelerated margin expansion.Mr. Nye concluded, “Our resilient and durable business model gives us the confidence in our ability to continue our industry-leading operational, financial and regulatory performance while successfully navigating the dynamic macroeconomic environment and sustainably delivering value for shareholders.”Fourth-Quarter Financial and Operating Results(All financial and operating results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise noted)Building Materials BusinessThe Building Materials business generated products and services revenues of $1.31 billion for the fourth quarter, a 1.7 percent decrease, attributable to colder temperatures and increased precipitation across most of the Company’s geographies. However, products and services gross profit increased 4.0 percent to a fourth-quarter record of $331.1 million. Products and services gross margin improved 140 basis points to 25.2 percent as the effect of multiple price increases during the year more than offset higher operating costs and lower, weather-impacted, shipments.Aggregates  Fourth-quarter aggregates shipments decreased 12.0 percent, largely due to inclement weather in a number of key markets compared to the unseasonably warm and dry prior-year period that extended 2021 construction activity. Pricing increased 16.5 percent, a quarterly record, or 13.8 percent on a mix-adjusted basis, due to the cumulative effect of multiple price increases throughout the year.Fourth-quarter aggregates product gross profit improved 10.1 percent to a fourth-quarter record of $239.0 million. Similarly, product gross margin improved 200 basis points to 28.2 percent, as robust pricing growth more than offset lower shipments and increased costs.CementDespite robust product demand, fourth quarter cement shipments decreased 10.8 percent to 0.9 million tons, primarily attributable to wet and cold weather in Texas. Pricing increased 20.8 percent, aided by largely sold-out conditions and the compounding effect of the year’s multiple price increases. Cement product gross profit grew 4.4 percent to a fourth-quarter record of $58.2 million. Product gross margin declined 140 basis points to 39.6 percent, as pricing gains were not enough to offset the impacts of lower operating leverage and higher energy, raw materials and maintenance costs in the period.Downstream businessesReady mixed concrete product revenues and product gross profit declined 35.4 percent and 39.9 percent, respectively, driven largely by the April 1 divestiture of the Company’s Colorado and Central Texas ready mixed concrete businesses, impacting comparability with the prior year. Increased raw materials costs for aggregates and cement weighed on product gross profit and product gross margin.Asphalt and paving product and services revenues increased 16.3 percent to $198.6 million while product and services gross profit decreased 6.9 percent to $18.4 million as price increases did not fully offset raw material cost increases.Magnesia Specialties BusinessMagnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 6.0 percent to $63.5 million, driven by lower demand for chemical and lime products. Product gross profit declined 18.0 percent to $21.3 million as lower volumes and higher energy and maintenance costs adversely impacted the fourth quarter.Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and LiquidityCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $991.2 million compared with $1.14 billion for the prior-year period.Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $481.8 million.During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company returned $309.1 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, 13.1 million shares remained under the current repurchase authorization.The Company had $358.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand and $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2022.Full-Year 2023 GuidanceThe Company’s 2023 guidance excludes businesses classified as discontinued operations.2023 GUIDANCE (Dollars in Millions) Low *  High * Consolidated      Products and services revenues $6,180  $6,370 Interest expense $165  $170 Estimated tax rate (excluding discrete events)  21%  22%Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta $880  $990 Adjusted EBITDA1 $1,800  $1,900 Capital expenditures $575  $625        Building Materials Business      Aggregates      Volume % growth2  (2.0)%  2.0%ASP % growth3  13.0%  15.0%Product gross profit $1,225  $1,295        Cement, Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt and Paving      Products and services gross profit $380  $420        Magnesia Specialties Business      Product gross profit $100  $110 * Guidance range represents the low end and high end of the respective line items provided above.1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measures are included in the Appendix to this earnings release. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are commonly used financial measures for investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and, when read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, present a useful tool to evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations, performance from period to period and anticipated performance. In addition, these are some of the factors the Company uses in internal evaluations of the overall performance of its businesses. Management acknowledges that there are many items that impact a company’s reported results and the adjustments reflected in these non-GAAP measures are not intended to present all items that may have impacted these results. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Conference Call InformationThe Company will discuss its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 earnings results on a conference call and an online webcast today (February 15, 2023).

The Company’s outlook is subject to various risks and uncertainties and is based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results. Factors that the Company currently believes could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this release (including the outlook) include, but are not limited to: the ability of the Company to face challenges, including shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control; a widespread decline in aggregates pricing, including a decline in aggregates shipment volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the history of both cement and ready mixed concrete being subject to significant changes in supply, demand and price fluctuations; the termination, capping and/or reduction or suspension of the federal and/or state fuel tax(es) or other revenue related to public construction; the level and timing of federal, state or local transportation or infrastructure or public projects funding, most particularly in Texas, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, Iowa, Florida, Indiana and Arizona; the United States Congress’ inability to reach agreement among themselves or with the Administration on policy issues that impact the federal budget; the ability of states and/or other entities to finance approved projects either with tax revenues or alternative financing structures; levels of construction spending in the markets the Company serves; a reduction in defense spending and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in energy-related construction activity resulting from suspension of the fuel tax or a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns or capital spending, particularly in Texas and West Virginia; increasing residential mortgage interest rates and other factors that could result in a slowdown in residential construction; unfavorable weather conditions, particularly Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico storm and hurricane activity, wildfires, the late start to spring or the early onset of winter and the impact of a drought or excessive rainfall in the markets served by the Company, any of which can significantly affect production schedules, volumes, product and/or geographic mix and profitability; the volatility of fuel costs, particularly diesel fuel, notably related to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact on the cost, or the availability generally, of other consumables, namely steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts, and with respect to the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business, natural gas; continued increases in the cost of other repair and supply parts; construction labor shortages and/or supply‐chain challenges; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to production facilities; the resiliency and potential declines of the Company’s various construction end-use markets; the potential negative impacts of  global health crises such as COVID-19 and its variants; increasing governmental regulation, including environmental laws and climate change regulations; transportation availability or a sustained reduction in capital investment by the railroads, notably the availability of railcars, locomotive power and the condition of rail infrastructure to move trains to supply the Company’s Texas, Colorado, Florida, Carolinas and Gulf Coast markets, including the movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan and its customers; increased transportation costs, including increases from higher or fluctuating passed-through energy costs or fuel surcharges, and other costs to comply with tightening regulations, as well as higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability of trucks and licensed drivers for transport of the Company’s materials; availability and cost of construction equipment in the United States; weakening in the steel industry markets served by the Company’s dolomitic lime products; trade disputes with one or more nations impacting the U.S. economy, including the impact of tariffs on the steel industry; unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers that introduce volatility to earnings, including that of the Magnesia Specialties business that is running at capacity; proper functioning of information technology and automated operating systems to manage or support operations; inflation and its effect on both production and interest costs; the concentration of customers in construction markets and the increased risk of potential losses on customer receivables; the impact of the level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and management of production costs on the operating leverage and therefore profitability of the Company; the possibility that the expected synergies from acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, including achieving anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with the Company’s leverage ratio debt covenant; changes in tax laws, the interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices, including acquisitions or divestitures, that would increase the Company’s tax rate; violation of the Company’s debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous levels of instability; downward pressure on the Company’s common stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations; the possibility of a reduction of the Company’s credit rating to non-investment grade; and other risk factors listed from time to time found in the Company’s filings with the SEC. You should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in Martin Marietta’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Martin Marietta’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 and other periodic filings made with the SEC.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 24 cents per share on revenues of $6.1 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider missed the consensus mark due to a spike in operations and maintenance costs. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. However, revenues of $8.4 billion came in 24.1% above the consensus mark, backed by the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, and a demand boost from favorable weather.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Southern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 33.3% decrease year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 5.7% improvement from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added nearly 11,000 new residential electric customers and more than 8,000 residential natural gas customers in the third quarter. This trend most likely continued in the October-December period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the third quarter increased 37% year over year to $6.2 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 High Growth Utility Stocks to Buy. The US utilities industry in 2023 aims to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy or safe water to customers, but face challenges in balancing the energy equation due to pressure around decarbonization, cleaner energy adoption, electrification, infrastructure needs, and customer-driven disruption. The electric power sector faced both risks and opportunities in 2022. US electricity sales increased by 3.6% in the first eight months compared to the previous year, as the pandemic recovery progressed. However, costs rose significantly due to natural gas prices more than doubling, which was caused by global shortages worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires also continued to test the resilience of the regional power grids. To address these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked to increase reserves, deploy energy storage and microgrids, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance flexible load options. In 2023, despite the challenges faced by the US utilities industry, the emergence of new technologies and supportive policies could present opportunities and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.The Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, worth $430 billion, includes funding for tax credits and direct payments to promote the adoption of solar, wind, battery, and other energy sources and facilitate the transition of the electric power industry away from fossil fuels. Large American electric utility firms specializing in renewable power projects will be the biggest beneficiaries from the federal clean energy funding. Emily Beagle, research associate at Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that the location of utility companies will determine how much they stand to gain from the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar projects in sunnier states of the South and Southwest and wind projects in the Midwest are likely to gain the highest IRA budget, she said. Story continuesSome of the best utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc.

Yet, we are worried about the stiff competition faced by ResMed. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has lost 18.7% compared with the 51.7% decline of the industry.ResMed exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. Mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting the post-COVID pandemic awareness about the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health. The company registered strong customer uptake of the re-engineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device.To meet the additional demand in relation to a competitor’s recall, the company is working closely with its global supply chain partners to improve access to additional supplies of critical components. The company is also reengineering designs, validating new parts, pieces, supplies and speeding up product launches and development to keep up with demand.ResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. PriceResMed Inc. price | ResMed Inc. QuoteResMed continues to see robust demand for its market-leading mask portfolio despite being faced with challenges related to lower new patient setups from a competitor recall. The company recorded increased masks and other sales in the United States, Canada and Latin America region in the fiscal second quarter, where growth was 11% on a reported basis, reflecting solid resupply revenues amid a challenging device-supply environment. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets increased 14% in constant currency terms.On the flip side, ResMed did not derive any incremental revenues from COVID-related demand in the fiscal second quarter 2023 compared with the year-ago period. During the quarter, ResMed’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.2% year over year, predominantly on increases in employee-related expenses, professional service fees and travel expenses.Story continuesMeanwhile, research and development expenses increased 11.8%. The rising expenses resulted in an adjusted operating margin contraction of 36 basis points year over year to 29.6%, thus weighing on the company’s bottom line. The persistent supply-chain challenges related to securing sufficient components hamper its ability to meet the growing device demand.The volatility surrounding COVID-related restrictions across the globe also continues to pose challenges. Further, pricing pressure in the United States and Europe has been a staggering issue over the past few quarters. Healthcare reform in the United States has resulted in a degree of uncertainty for medical device companies and created a less flexible pricing environment. Currency headwinds continue to affect ResMed's overseas sales.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

It operates in four segments: diagnostics, medical devices, nutritional products and established pharmaceuticals. The company quickly established itself as a global leader in the development and deployment of COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests. Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

We believe that these events, one positive and one negative, have distorted Abbott’s sustainable earning power and has given us an opportunity to purchase it with a margin of safety.”10.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Boston Scientific share price has climbed 77% in five years, easily topping the market return of 47% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 7.0% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Boston Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 43% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 105.32, the market remains optimistic.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Boston Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Boston Scientific has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.0% in the last twelve months. However, that falls short of the 12% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance.

For more stocks, head on over to Mario Gabelli Stock Picks for 2023: Top 5.GAMCO Investors, Inc. is an American hedge fund that is headquartered in Rye, New York. It is one of the largest investment institutions in the world, with a total of $9.2 billion of stock market investments as of the fourth quarter of last year (for the biggest hedge funds in the world, head on over to 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM). The fund is managed by Mr. Mario J. Gabelli, who is its chief executive officer. Mr. Gabelli set up GAMCO, previously known as Gabelli Asset Management Company, in 1976, and has been running it since then, giving him decades of experience in the finance industry.2022 has been a year of significant economic turmoil, and as we enter 2023, institutions and investors all over are sharing their thoughts on what to expect. For instance, investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the more optimistic analysts right now, as it believes that the ever dreaded recession that is being speculated since the mid of last year might be avoided. Mr. Gabelli also has a take on the current situation, and in an interview with CNBC he mirrored sentiments that while the first half of this year will be turbulent, investors can expect the market to take off in 2024. His research comes from the proverbial horse's mouth, as the investor outlined:""A year from now, Joe [laughs], it's gonna be 2024 and the opportunities a year later are gonna be terrific. But short term, what I'm learning from visiting companies, listening to meetings, reading the dynamics, one, goods are becoming more available, but more importantly, the managements have learned how to deal with pass throughs, how to deal with inflation, how to deal with currency, how to deal with the balance sheet and interest rates. And they're learning the inelastic questions about the demand for their products. Now from my point of view revenue's gonna be quite okay this year in nominal terms. Gross margins are going to be challenged short term for the manufacturing sector. SG&amp;A, kind of held in check, and then the question is taxes, we talked about, there's a 15% tax on booked profits, that's kinda gotta be worked out. Bottom line, I think that things are okay, but there's going to be a lot of tension in the first half of the year in the markets.""Story continuesNaturally, his insight merits a deeper look at GAMCO Investors' latest investments, out of which the top three are Herc Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HRI), GATX Corporation (NYSE:GATX), and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

Also in that report, a look at what consumers are and are not buying from Coca-Cola. As you can see, shares down a bit. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and coffee products leading sales gains for the quarter with coffee up 11%, and Coca-Cola zero. Sugar up 9%, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. It looks like people might be prioritizing those lower-calorie beverages if you take a look just in terms of the growth that we are seeing there. Also, coffee. You always need coffee. I don't think it's a huge head-scratcher why maybe the growth there.- Recession-proof. COVID-proof.SEANA SMITH: Exactly.- Everything-proof.SEANA SMITH: It makes a lot of sense. All right. So let's take a look at what we did not see working here for Coca-Cola in that quarter. The popularity of some of their categories fell. You can see it on your screen. Juice, dairy, their plant-based division, sales they're falling about 7%. Tea sales there falling 9% in the fourth quarter compared to the levels that we saw a year ago during that same quarter.Despite these price increases, the fact that it is working on some products, not working on other products, CEO James Quincey, he didn't really say anything in terms of the fact that they won't be really easing those pricing pressures any time soon. In fact, higher prices are pretty likely here, saying that we don't see the runway for those higher prices running out any time soon. Wedbush making the argument that Coca-Cola, given the brand, they have the pricing power. They have the ability to do it.But we are seeing consumers pull back just a little bit as evidenced in that juice category, and also what we saw there in some of their other categories.Story continues- But that's more based on sugar, I think, and not prices. There's not a lot of disinflationary news in many of these earnings reports. They did see some not great numbers in the sports-drink category. And their CEO says they have to reset ourselves there. They bought Body Armor recently. Those sales were down. And they saw a slight uptick in Powerade, but only up 1% in that category.So what are they going to buy next? Coca-Cola has a couple of categories out there, one being alcoholic beverages. Next month, we get Jack and Coke in a can, and Zero Sugar Jack and Coke in a can. They're also going to enter an alcoholic Fresca with Constellation Brands, and alcoholic Topo Chico with Molson. So they are all over the space.On the other hand, there's this Coca Cola move associated with Rosalía Grammy-winning Spanish artist. This is more of a lifestyle, not necessarily a flavor, but an experience for young people. QR codes linking you to songs. Which direction do you think will be more successful?SEANA SMITH: Well, it's hard to argue against that can, though, we have on the screen right now. It looks like a heck of a lot of fun. I think it's very smart for Coca-Cola to make those partnerships with huge celebrity celebrities, clearly targeting that younger generation.But when it comes to the future of canned cocktails-- we've talked time and time again on this program-- surveys had shown that Gen Z, a lot of them prefer the mixed drinks. They prefer those types of canned cocktails. I think is a huge home, potentially for Coca-Cola getting into that division, getting into the alcohol business.- I have to agree with you there. And the alcoholic Frescas? I got to try that. Fresca's delicious.SEANA SMITH: That sounds very good it.- Constellation Brands partnership.SEANA SMITH: Sounds like a good spring-summer drink.- 12 months a year. But yes, in particular.]"

Adjusted operating margins improved by 60 basis points from a year ago.The company said it expects to see full-year organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, above analyst estimates of 7.2%. Earnings are expected to rise 4-5%.Story continuesCoca-Cola stock fell slightly on Tuesday, and the company had the third most visited ticker page on the Yahoo Finance platform.""Investor expectations heading into today’s print were high, particularly following PepsiCo's recent strong results, and Coca-Cola delivered with an impressive top line beat, although headwinds from the BODYARMOR acquisition and higher operating costs drove EPS in-line with our/FactSet cons estimates,"" explained Goldman Sachs beverage analyst Bonnie Herzog in a client note.

Growth opportunities from the robust adoption of the multi-cloud model should offset challenges arising from cyber threats and expenditures related to hiring skillful talent and restructuring initiatives.Trane Technologies plc TT, Matterport, Inc. MTTR and TuSimple Holdings Inc. TSP are some stocks, which are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Technology Services industry comprises companies that are engaged in manufacturing, developing and designing an array of software support, data processing, computing hardware and communications equipment. These include integrated powertrain technologies, advanced analytics, technology solutions and contract research services, semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies, collaboration software, specialty printers, and data acquisition and analysis systems. The industry includes consumer as well as business-oriented products and services. It comprises companies with diversified end-markets and customer base. Some industry participants also provide advanced analytics, clinical research services, data storage technology and solutions, and technology-enabled financial solutions to consumers, small business owners, tax professionals.What's Shaping the Future of the Technology Services Industry?Remote &amp; Hybrid Work Model Trends Boost Prospects: The industry’s growth is expected to accelerate in the days ahead based on an increasing number of remote and hybrid workers. In this era of digital transformation, enterprises are actively seeking a common ground between on-premise and cloud infrastructures, enabling them to provide flexible, as well as easily adaptable hybrid solutions. The coronavirus-induced remote-working trend has led to increased demand for cloud and cost-efficient business support solutions, as well as other digital monetization solutions, which bode well for the industry.Story continuesDigitization Wave is a Tailwind: Most industry participants are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes to keep themselves updated with evolving IT services. The aim is to integrate synergies of emerging technologies, including the cloud, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and analytics. Moreover, increasing Internet penetration in emerging markets, particularly across the Asia-Pacific, is a tailwind.Adoption of the Multi-Cloud Model: The growing uptake of the multi-cloud model to achieve better scalability and attain improved resource utilization is also expanding the scope of the industry participants. Cloud and hardware/software virtual technologies are anticipated to favorably impact the industry. As growth and investment opportunities in developed countries continue to slow down, we believe that emerging economies will play a crucial role in the days ahead.Growing Cyber Attacks a Tailwind: The increasing number of cyber-attacks and related security risks are expected to keep the industry’s momentum alive. Government agencies are ideal targets for cyber-attacks, as they are entrusted with sensitive information. Therefore, the growing need for cyber security solutions and services in critical areas like defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government bodes well for the industry players.Talent Cost Woes: Rising spending on acquiring skilled talent and restructuring initiatives involving modernization of the IT-service infrastructure are causing higher debt levels, R&amp;D, and sales &amp; marketing expenses.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Technology Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101. This rank places it in the top 40% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that investors can buy or retain given their sturdy potential, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Technology Services industry has lagged the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 31.1% over this period compared with a 15.5% decline of the broader sector and an 8.7% downside of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing technology services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 40.55X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.03X and the sector’s 24.98X.Over the past year, the industry has traded as high as 53.68X, as low as 14.37X and at the median of 27.87X as the charts below show.EV-to-EBITDA3 Key Technology Services PicksWe are presenting three stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term.Trane Technologies: Trane remains focused on improving the quality of its products and services and operating efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in earnings and cash flow. It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments. Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently. TT’s 2023 guidance looks encouraging. Trane expects revenues to increase 7-9% on a reported basis and 6-8% on an organic basis. Adjusted EPS is expected between $8.20 and $8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trane’s 2023 EPS has improved 4.8% in the past 90 days. TT stock has gained 21.2% over the past year. It carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Price &amp; Consensus: TTMatterport: This California-based spatial data company focuses on digitization and datafication of the built world. Matterport’s top line is likely to benefit from strength across subscription and annual recurring revenues. A strong subscriber base, industry partnerships, product launches and expanded service offerings act as other tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Matterport’s 2023 EPS has improved 5.4% in the past 90 days. MTTR stock has declined 59.2% over the past year. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Price &amp; Consensus: MTTRTuSimple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) California-based autonomous technology company develops autonomous technology specifically designed for semi-trucks in the United States and internationally.

380,7401b84b-45f2-32c3-a904-6682ae956e78,LYB,2023-02-15,Leading a Sustainable Future: Tackling Scope 3 Emissions,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-sustainable-future-tackling-scope-150000365.html,1676386800,STORY,['LYB'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 14, 2023 / Recently, we announced LyondellBasell's new climate ambitions. Today I am writing to give you my reflection on the importance of LyondellBasell's recent bold and significant moves: reducing our Scope 3 emissions. I started my sustainability career at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), leading the development of the scope 3 standard, an extensive process between WBCSD, the World Resources Institute (WRI), more involving than 60 companies and hundreds of stakeholders. The WRI and the WBCSD created the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) in 2001 to help companies to measure emissions and identify opportunities to reduce them. The development of the scope 3 standard was part of the GHGP.My experience with GHGP standards, combined with working with over 200 companies to advance the sustainability transition for 10 years, has given me the know-how to lead LyondellBasell's sustainability efforts and contribute to advancing the company's climate ambition strategy, including reducing scope 3 emissions. The actions LyondellBasell is taking in support of our new climate ambitions demonstrate tangible steps to advance a more sustainable future.As I reflect today, we are living with inflation, a war in Europe, energy insecurity, and a potential global recession. I realize how brave and committed our company is to lead and advance our sustainability position by increasing our emission reduction targets during these challenging times.Our step forward in sustainability is achievable, smart for business and good for society. We are taking concrete action to create value while also positioning us to be a first-mover to address growing customer demand, as well as societal, customer, brand owner and investor expectations.The Importance and Challenges of Scope 3Scope 3 (also known as value chain emissions) represents corporations' greatest proportion of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the chemical industry, scope 3 emissions account for approximately 75% of all total emissions. Yet, it is the most challenging to tackle, particularly because the sources of these emissions are not controlled by the company, i.e., the products, materials and services a company buys in order to make its products and the subsequent downstream use and disposal of these products. Many global companies in chemicals and other industrial sectors are reluctant to commit to tackling scope 3 emissions given the value chain challenges, such as the complexity of measuring the emissions (which entails complicated data collection), and the need for more transparency in the supply chain. However, to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius, there is an urgency to accelerate decarbonization efforts, including significantly reducing scope 3 emissions.Story continuesWhat Scopes 1, 2 &amp; 3 meanThe GHGP defines emissions as follows:Scope 1 - These are direct GHG emissions occurring from sources owned or controlled by the company, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces.Scope 2 - They are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the company.Scope 3 - These are all other indirect emissions from sources in the value chain, such as the extraction and production of raw materials, or from the use of sold products.While many countries and organizations require reporting scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions reporting is mostly voluntary.Understanding Our New Climate AmbitionsIn December 2022, LyondellBasell announced it is increasing the company's 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target for:Increasing scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions reduction from 30 percent to 42 percent, relative to a 2020 baseline.Establishing a 2030 scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 30 percent, relative to a 2020 baseline.For us, it was important our updated climate goals aligned to the latest science and that we seek to have them validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The SBTi is a partnership between the non-profit CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). This initiative defines and promotes best practices in science-based climate target setting for companies.The SBTi requires companies to include a scope 3 target when scope 3 emissions exceed 40% of the company's total emissions, which is the case for LyondellBasell. SBTi requires Scope 3 goals to align with a well-below two-degree pathway or GHG emissions reduction of 2.5% per year. Over the 10 years from LyondellBasell's 2020 baseline to 2030, this translates to a reduction of 25%. Therefore, our new scope 3 goal to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 exceeds the SBTi minimum requirements.Advancing Scopes 1,2 &amp; 3 GHG emissions reductionWe are progressing with our strategic plan and timeline for implementing the steps to reduce our carbon emissions. As announced in April 2022, one concrete action to reduce scope 3 emissions is to close our Houston refinery by the end of December 2023. This plan is on track and is expected to reduce scope 3 emissions by approximately 40 million metric tons annually.In addition, there are many emissions reduction initiatives planned for implementation by 2030, yet beginning in 2024, including:Process heat recovery projects, electrification of a large process turbine and optimization of steam demand at its site in Wesseling, Germany, in 2024Optimization of heated equipment through advanced digitization, efficiency improvements and fuel management at its site in Channelview, Texas, in 2025Also, as announced last week, we signed eight PPA agreements and achieved over half of our 2030 target to procure a minimum of 50 percent of global electricity from renewable sources. These PPAs will generate over 2.6 million megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable electricity annually and reduce the company's scope 2 emissions by nearly 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to the emissions associated with the annual electricity consumption of more than 370,000 homes. In addition, we are continuing with plans to phase out the use of coal at our Wesseling, Germany site, reducing the site's scope 2 emissions by about 170 thousand metric tons annually.Furthermore, as we progress in our Circular and Low Carbon Solutions efforts to achieve our 2 million metric tons (MM MT) goal for recycled and renewable products, the corresponding increases in recycling rates will positively impact scope 3 emissions. We expect the emissions reductions we will get from accomplishing this goal to be incremental to the plans we currently have to reduce our scope 3 emissions by 30% by 2030. We estimate approximately 1-1.5MM MT scope 3 reductions coming from achieving our circularity ambition.Lastly, LyondellBasell is part of several sector initiatives through our engagement with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Together for Sustainability (TfS) to further understand and act upon the common challenges of the chemical industry in dealing with scope 3 emissions. LyondellBasell is also taking part in efforts led by the SBTi to develop a sectoral decarbonization approach for the chemical industry. We expect this approach will take into account the specific challenges the chemical industry is facing, as a hard-to-abate sector, in its journey to reaching a state of net zero GHG emissions.Invigorating TimesTackling scope 3 emissions must remain a top priority for businesses worldwide, regardless of the challenges. Working at a company with colleagues who are committed to action, are fantastic collaborators, are willing to take a chance on ideas, and see sustainability strategy as an opportunity is INVIGORATING. As such, we will continue to find innovative ways to reduce our emissions and offer circular and low carbon solutions to address GHG emissions. While plenty of work remains, sustainability no longer feels like a far-away goal-we're on our path to leading it and enabling a more sustainable future for all.More information on our sustainability commitments can be found here.LyondellBasell, Tuesday, February 14, 2023, Press release pictureLyondellBasell Vice President and Chief Sustainability OfficerView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739300/Leading-a-Sustainable-Future-Tackling-Scope-3-Emissions]"

On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 15.6% and revenues increased 37.7%.Vulcan Materials’ earnings topped the consensus mark in three of the last four quarters and missed the same on one occasion, with the average surprise being 5%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share has been revised downward to $1.32 from $1.36 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion, suggesting 13.1% year-over-year growth.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-eps-surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteFactors to NoteThe slowing residential market, wet weather (mainly in October and November 2022 compared to the year-ago period), rail freight bottlenecks and cement shortages are expected to reflect in fourth-quarter aggregates volumes of the companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Nonetheless, higher non-residential construction activities and incremental federal funding from the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act should have acted as a tailwind for fourth-quarter 2022. Also, resilient pricing — given the growth in all product lines — is expected to have supported growth for Vulcan.Higher spending from a number of states that it serves is likely to have aided revenues. The aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand, and gravel, along with other aggregates) has been a major contributor to revenue growth. Efforts to enhance operational excellence, acquisition synergies and cost-control measures are expected to have aided the bottom line to some extent.However, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs and supply &amp; contract costs may have been risks. Inflation from hydrocarbons, rising liquid asphalt costs, insurance and labor, might have added to the negatives. Along with higher energy prices, VMC's Mexican operations shutdown is added negative.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Aggregates segment (accounting for 72% of total revenues) is pegged at $1,287 million, indicating an increase from $1,152 million a year ago.The consensus mark for net sales from the Concrete segment (accounting for 13.8% of total revenues) is $419 million, suggesting an increase from $370 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales from the Asphalt Mix segment (14% of total revenues) is pegged at $246 million, indicating growth from $197 million a year ago.The consensus mark for the Calcium segment’s net sales is $4.93 million, suggesting an increase from $1.40 million a year ago.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vulcan this time around.

384,32a05737-99eb-36d6-82bb-db07ca36c006,CINF,2023-02-15,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Cincinnati Financial (CINF) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005541.html,1676394005,STORY,['CINF'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Cincinnati Financial (CINF), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cincinnati Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CINF that show why this insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor CINF, shares are up 8.74% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.88% compares favorably with the industry's 2.59% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Cincinnati Financial have increased 18.95% over the past quarter, and have gained 4.93% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 4.08% and -4.79%, respectively.Investors should also take note of CINF's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CINF is averaging 681,961 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with CINF.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CINF's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.51 to $5.13 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CINF is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Cincinnati Financial on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The source, who asked not to be identified, could not specify the costs.Separately, European planemaker Airbus SE is tempering the pace of planned production increases due in part to supply chain stress.The engine makers worked with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after combined efforts by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency missed the U.N. standard's Jan. 1, 2023, deadline. The workaround is possible because of the interconnected nature of the global aerospace industry, but the situation is not ideal.It comes as Washington's traditional aviation leadership has grown more diluted after the crisis over the design and approval of Boeing's 737 MAX.""Delayed adoption of the (U.N.) rule highlights the importance of streamlining the rulemaking process in today's global market to ensure U.S. competitiveness,"" said David Silver, vice president of civil aviation for the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), an American trade association representing manufacturers and suppliers of aircraft.AIA warned in 2021 about delayed rulemaking involving the U.S. FAA and EPA.EASA said it went ahead with paperwork for the U.S. enginemakers and the FAA supported it.A GE spokesperson said the company complied with EASA's rules while Pratt referred questions to AIA.Story continuesIn 2020, the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted the standard. But ICAO cannot impose its will on governments, so the United States, Europe and other countries must translate the global engine standards into national rules.It was first vetted by the EPA, which produced a rule effective Dec. 23, 2022.But the changes must also be signed off by the FAA, which said it ""expects to complete the final rule later in 2023,"" so companies can certify their engines domestically.A U.S. government source said the rulemaking process was delayed because of work by the agencies on a separate ICAO carbon emissions standard for aircraft.(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal.

The deal was signed in coordination with the airline’s firm order for 20 Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777X aircraft.""All of us at Tata Group and Air India are delighted to have this partnership with GE Aerospace, where we will build Air India to be a world class airline and one of the most technology-advanced airlines,"" said Mr. N.

Lawrence Culp, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GE and CEO of GE Aerospace. ""We look forward to working together to introduce these engines into Air India’s fleet and are committed to ensuring they deliver exceptional performance.""GE Aerospace has powered Air India since 1982, when the airline took delivery of its first CF6-powered Airbus A300. The airline currently operates a fleet of more than 150 aircraft, including GE90-powered Boeing 777s and GEnx-powered Boeing 787s.Air India also announced a CFM order for more than 800 LEAP engines, the largest LEAP order ever, to power its entire narrowbody purchase of 210 Airbus A320/A321neo aircraft and 190 Boeing 737 MAX-family aircraft. The announcement includes a multi-year CFM services agreement. CFM is a 50/50 joint business between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.""This order for GE Aerospace engines supports our Vihaan.AI transformation plan, a key part of which is to dramatically expand our fleet and global network,"" said Campbell Wilson, CEO &amp; Managing Director of Air India.

""This record order reflects our strong product renewal and our customer’s continued confidence in our engines.""Today’s announcement includes GE and CFM's most technically advanced commercial engines:The GE9X, the world’s most powerful and GE's most fuel-efficient turbofan, powers the Boeing 777X family of aircraft. The engine offers the lowest NOx emissions in its class, 55% below current regulatory requirements. It is also the quietest GE engine ever produced on a pounds of thrust per decibel basis.The GEnx, powers the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, has an innovative lean burning twin-annular pre-swirl (TAPS) combustor that dramatically reduces NOx and other regulated gases below today's regulatory limits, offering 15% better fuel burn than the CF6 engine.The LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B, have accumulated more than 27 million flying hours. LEAP operators are reporting up to a 20 percent improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions compared to the latest production CFM56 engines, resulting in an average of more than 17 million tons of CO2 emissions reduction.Like all GE and CFM engines, the GEnx, GE9X and LEAP are compatible with all approved Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends.GE Aerospace also provides multiple systems for the Boeing 777X. This includes the Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR), the Electrical Load Management System (ELMS) and the Backup Generator, Backup Converter (BUG/BUC) and the Common Core System (CCS). The CCS is often referred to as the ""central nervous system and brain"" of the airplane and hosts the aircraft’s avionics and utilities functions, eliminating several boxes and reducing hundreds of pounds of wire. GE Aerospace also supplies the CCS and EAFR for the Boeing 787.GE Aerospace has been operating in India for over four decades with wide engagement in the industry including engines, avionics, services, engineering, manufacturing, and local sourcing.Engineers at the John F. Welch Technology Centre (JFWTC) in Bangalore, India, GE's research and development center, have played a key role in the technology development of the GE9X, GEnx, and CFM LEAP engines by providing analysis and test validation support.

The grant will expand the North Carolina Statewide Telepsychiatry Program (NC-STeP), in the ECU Center for Telepsychiatry, in six community-based pediatric and primary care clinics in rural and underserved parts of the state to support the mental health and well-being of young people in North Carolina.""Just like we take care of our physical health, it’s important that we take care of our mental health as well,"" said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. ""This partnership will help reach even more young people in our rural and historically underserved communities.""""We are extremely grateful for the United Health Foundation’s continued support of East Carolina University’s NC-STeP program,"" said ECU Chancellor Dr. Philip Rogers. ""The investment will increase the university’s outreach to the region and provide mental health services to underserved populations in North Carolina. ECU students across multiple disciplines will engage with this project, leading to increased learning opportunities preparing them to address the critical shortage of mental health professionals.""Youth mental health challenges are on the rise across the country, according to the America’s Health Rankings 2022 Health of Women and Children Report. The report revealed anxiety among children and adolescents increased 23% and depression increased 27% between 2017-2018 and 2020-2021. In North Carolina, children experience significant challenges accessing the care needed to address their mental health. More than 70% of children with a mental health disorder do not receive treatment and 92% of North Carolina counties are designated as mental health professional shortage areas. This partnership will help connect youth with mental health care services – particularly in areas with provider shortages.Story continuesOver three years, it aims to:Embed behavioral health providers at six community-based pediatric care clinics and connect them – as well as the primary care providers – to a psychiatrist for case consultation and care planning via telepsychiatry.Develop an artificial intelligence-driven portal to enhance collaboration between health care providers and encourage family members’ engagement in their child’s mental health care.Educate children and families about mental health and well-being through the development of a new virtual reality video game that provides anonymous peer-to-peer support.Offer training opportunities for ECU psychiatry residents, child psychiatry fellows, social work students, medical students and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners at the six community clinics.Hold an Interdisciplinary Telehealth Summit to share lessons learned from the project.""We’re honored and excited to partner with East Carolina University to address key health challenges our young people are facing,"" said Anita Bachmann, chief executive officer, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of North Carolina, part of UnitedHealth Group. ""By working together and creating an interconnected system of clinical and social services, we can continue to produce better health outcomes for North Carolinians.""The United Health Foundation and ECU also partnered in 2020 through a $1.25 million grant to expand telepsychiatry services to address the mental health needs of expectant and new mothers.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +1.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 0.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.23 per share, indicating a change of +13.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.91 points to a change of +12.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.22 indicates a change of +13.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $89.31 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $358.97 billion and $383.77 billion estimates indicate +10.7% and +6.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $82.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $5.34 for the same period compares with $4.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +3.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc.

Consequently, its revenue and profit growth accelerated during the pandemic. As demand for testing slowed to a more sustainable level, the company is facing difficult earnings comparisons. In addition, Abbott voluntarily recalled certain infant formula products and shut down a plant in Michigan where the products were manufactured, which put more pressure on its earnings comparisons.

Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow last year. However, the Dow suffered the least.Dow Changes Course in 2023In 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Last year, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% to combat 40-year high inflation.A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks. Therefore, the index suffered the least. However, the situation has taken a turn in 2023.Dow Lags Peers Year to DateLess-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. On Jan 31, the Department of Labor reported that the employment cost index for fourth-quarter 2022 rose 1%, below the consensus mark of a 1.2% rise. The metric for third-quarter 2022 was also 1.2%. The data clearly indicates that wage rate, a major source of current inflation is declining as expected by the Fed.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Market participants are expecting two more rate hike of 25 basis points each in 2023.The technology sector is no longer overvalued. We are seeing early signs of market participants’ confidence returning to this sector. Of the three major stock indexes — year to date — The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 7.8% and 13.6%, respectively. The Dow gained just 3.3%.U.S. Economy is CoolingThe U.S. economy expanded 2.9% in fourth-quarter 2022. Although the metric exceeded the consensus mark of 2.6%, it declined from the third-quarter’s growth rate of 3.2%. The latest projection by the Atlanta Fed revealed that the U.S. economy may have expanded by 2.2% in first-quarter 2023.Story continuesA devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers, a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities and a notable decline in factory orders and industrial production indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the direction desired by the Fed.Moreover, several U.S. corporate behemoths have already retrenched manpower to a good extent at high levels. Lack of earnings visibility due to some near-term concerns related to business opportunities is the primary reasons for recent job cuts.Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to a margin squeeze resulting in moderate GDP growth. Powell also warned of some toughness going forward. As a result, growth and momentum stocks may underperform cyclical value stocks in 2023.

399,7735154b-aec7-3f86-81d9-1b5387494403,SRCL,2023-02-15,Stericycle's (NASDAQ:SRCL) Returns On Capital Tell Us There Is Reason To Feel Uneasy,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stericycles-nasdaq-srcl-returns-capital-145331639.html,1676386411,STORY,['SRCL'],"[To avoid investing in a business that's in decline, there's a few financial metrics that can provide early indications of aging. More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. In light of that, from a first glance at Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Stericycle, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.036 = US$173m ÷ (US$5.3b - US$587m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Stericycle has an ROCE of 3.6%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Commercial Services industry average of 9.1%. View our latest analysis for Stericycle roceIn the above chart we have measured Stericycle's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?We are a bit anxious about the trends of ROCE at Stericycle. To be more specific, today's ROCE was 9.0% five years ago but has since fallen to 3.6%. On top of that, the business is utilizing 21% less capital within its operations. When you see both ROCE and capital employed diminishing, it can often be a sign of a mature and shrinking business that might be in structural decline. If these underlying trends continue, we wouldn't be too optimistic going forward.In Conclusion...To see Stericycle reducing the capital employed in the business in tandem with diminishing returns, is concerning. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 26% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.Story continuesStericycle does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.While Stericycle may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

If you want to skip reading about George Soros' investing philosophy and his hedge fund's performance, you can go directly to George Soros' Top 5 Holdings.George Soros is a Hungarian-born American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author. He is widely considered one of the most successful investors in the world and is the founder of Soros Fund Management, a New York-based investment management company that is now structured as a family office. According to Forbes, George Soros has a real-time net worth of $6.7 billion, as of February 14.George Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970 and ran it as a hedge fund up till 2011, averaging an annual return of 20% from 1970 to 2011. Soros Fund Management has been dubbed as one of the most successful hedge funds in history. In 2011, Soros restructured Soros Fund Management as a family office and has since been focusing on his personal investments. Soros has also been an advocate of philanthropy and has donated billions of dollars to various charitable causes.Soros' Investing PhilosophySoros is famous for his investment philosophy that aims to take advantage of market inefficiencies. He is a proponent of reflexivity, a theory that states that market prices may be affected by changes in the beliefs, perceptions, and expectations of market participants. Soros has a long history of making successful investments. In 1992, he famously made over $1 billion by betting against the British pound, a feat that earned him the title ""The Man Who Broke the Bank of England"". Soros is known for his contrarian approach to investing. He often takes positions that are contrary to popular opinion, and has been able to make substantial profits in the process.Soros believes that markets are constantly changing and that investors must be vigilant and adaptable in order to stay ahead of the game. He looks for mispricings in the market and takes advantage of them. He is also an advocate of diversification and believes that investors should spread their money across multiple asset classes and sectors.Story continuesSoros believes in taking calculated risks and is not afraid to short stocks or go against the grain. Soros is a believer in the power of leverage and has made a fortune from using it. He believes that leveraging can amplify the returns of an investment, but it can also amplify losses if not used properly.Soros Fund Management: 13F PortfolioIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Soros Fund Management exited 144 positions, reduced its exposure to 32 securities, increased its exposure to 38 securities, and initiated new 82 positions.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) is a financial services company that provides brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and financial advisors in the United States.

(NASDAQ:LPLA) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We pared our exposure to LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LPLA), Genmab and Advanced Drainage Systems in Q4. LPL Financial is the largest independent broker-dealer in the US, and the largest provider of outsourced wealth management services to banks. The company equips over 21,000 financial advisors with the tools—research, technology, compliance and administrative support—to grow their businesses and help their retail clients with wealth management and financial planning. In recent years, a new leadership team has invested to improve advisor technology and remove friction within advisors’ workflows, driving a 50% increase in productivity while increasing advisor retention to ~98%. We believe LPL is well-positioned to capture further market share and benefit from a migration of advisors away from wire houses to the independent channel. We also feel optimistic that their outsourcing contract wins with third-party banks and traction in the company’s new service offerings could further accelerate growth. Lastly, LPL has benefited from higher interest rates. However, as the share price now reflects more of these tailwinds, we modestly pared our position.”13. indie Semiconductor, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INDI) is one of Soros' top stock picks.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected car, user experience, and electrification applications. We elected to take a tax loss on our prior position and have been rebuilding on recent weakness. We believe that the automotive semiconductor vertical is attractive as silicon content in cars increases over time from improving safety features and autonomous driving, electrification, and premiumization of interior and exterior features. Indie is a small but rapidly growing player in the automotive semiconductor space and has a multi-billion dollar contracted backlog, providing strong visibility to its revenue ramp in the coming years. Since coming public, the company has beaten expectations every quarter and is on track to turn profitable in 2023 and achieve targeted 60% gross and 30% operating margins by 2025. Indie’s management team has previously built a semiconductor company from the ground up, achieving a successful exit, giving us high confidence in their ability to execute their strategic plan with indie as well.”12. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Soros Fund Management's Stake Value: $61,743,980Percentage of Soros Fund Management's 13F Portfolio: 0.85%D.R. Horton, Inc.

(NYSE:DHI), the number one homebuilder by volume in the U.S., gained 31% in the most recent quarter following strong business results.We are bullish about the long-term prospects for D.R. Horton primarily due to two key considerations:1) We believe the company is positioned to perform well over time given its status as the largest and lowest-cost producer in the entrylevel home segment for first-time buyers and baby boomers looking for an affordable home. In the last fiscal year, approximately 67% of D.R. Horton’s home sales were for prices less than $400,000, thereby enabling the company to satisfy the home affordability constraints of many potential home buyers.2) We are enthusiastic about D.R. Horton’s continued transition to a stronger and more asset-light balance sheet by outsourcing its land development spending needs to third-party developers such as Forestar Group Inc. D.R. Horton’s transition to a less capital-intensive business model is leading to stronger cash-flow generation, lower debt levels, an ability to pursue more share repurchases and/or other investment opportunities, and a higher-valuation multiple.”11.

(NASDAQ:AMZN): Amazon was the top detractor for the quarter on mixed 3Q results and disappointing 4Q guidance. For 3Q22, the company reported revenue of $127 billion, up 15% year over year. Operating income, however, declined 48% year over year on higher energy costs and some onetime items. AWS operating income continues to grow from cloud computing adoption, up 11% year over year to $5 billion. 4Q guidance includes slowing AWS growth and lower-thanexpected operating income guidance, as the company continues to face inflationary headwinds (including energy, labor and freight).With its ability to continue its market share gains in three leading businesses (e-commerce, web services and online advertising), plus a multi-year operating margin expansion opportunity (from improved e-commerce margins and greater contribution from the faster growing, higher margin AWS and advertising segments), we believe Amazon remains one of the best-positioned global growth companies in the world. AMZN shares trade at a 10-year trough EPS multiple, despite what we believe to be currently depressed margins and earnings.”10. Signify Health, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.”8.

We believe the Liberty management team will successfully close the valuation gap at both underlying holding Charter and holdco Liberty Broadband, as we have seen sentiment on cable stocks shift many times over our decades at Southeastern.

""And our all-the-above approach is just getting started. As Eco-Airline of the Year, we will continue to lead the industry as an innovator in this space and affirm our unyielding commitment to build an American Airlines that will thrive forever.""With the airline's most extensive fleet renewal effort in industry history and substantial investments in fuel of the future, ATW highly regarded American's work to run a more fuel-efficient operation with more fuel-efficient aircraft powered increasingly by low-carbon fuel and new technology.Fuel-efficiency is maximized by a new application called smart gating, which optimizes gate assignments at congested airports. Smart gating is currently in use at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Miami International Airport and saves an estimated 1.4 million gallons of fuel and 13,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.Ongoing fleet renewal efforts have also helped the airline improve fuel efficiency by more than 10% since 2013, which has helped save 1.9 billion gallons of fuel and prevented 19 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Today, half of American's U.S. mainline fleet is less than 10 years old.Leading the industry in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) consumption, the world's largest airline used 2 million gallons of SAF in 2022 and doubled its usage year over year. SAF agreements with Gevo, Inc., Neste and Aemetis bring the airline's total low-carbon fuel commitments to more than 620 million gallons. American is also the first U.S. airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics.Story continuesAmerican was the first airline in the world to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its intermediate carbon emissions reduction goal. American's science-based target is to reduce its carbon intensity by 45% by 2035, compared to a 2019 baseline.The airline also appeared on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in 2022 for the second year in a row, improving its score by more than 20% year over year.Selected by a panel of editors and analysts at ATW, Routes, Aviation Week and CAPA, the ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards recognize excellence across a broad range of airline operations and is a coveted accomplishment in the air transport industry.""At a time when sustainability is a driving force in the aviation industry, American Airlines has a clear vision for the future of sustainable aviation and is making meaningful strides to reach their goals. With a comprehensive carbon emissions reduction strategy that touches nearly every part of their company, awarding Eco-Airline of the Year to American is incredibly well-deserved in what was the most competitive field yet,"" said ATW Editor-in-Chief Karen Walker.More information on American's approach to ESG is available at aa.com/esg, and details on the airline's sustainability strategy are available at aa.com/sustainability.About American Airlines GroupTo Care for People on Life's Journey®.

Let’s take a closer look at each one.The Hershey CompanyThe Hershey Company is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. HSY has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, helping push the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHershey reported strong quarterly results in its latest release on February 2nd, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 14% and reporting earnings of $2.02 per share.Quarterly revenue totaled $2.6 billion, handily beating our consensus sales estimate and growing 13% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, the company rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend, currently yielding 1.7%.

SPG, Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT and National Retail Properties, Inc. NNN.Industry: REIT - RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2053271/3-retail-reit-stocks-to-stay-afloat-despite-industry-hiccupsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of inflationary pressure and economic slowdown. Rising borrowing costs and labor market pessimism are likely to weigh down on consumers' willingness to spend. Also, higher e-commerce adoption might continue to affect retail landlords' cash flows.Nevertheless, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime amid limited new supply is likely to help industry fundamentals. Efforts to support omni-channel retailing, adaptive reuse capabilities and opportunities emanating from consolidations, and focus on e-commerce resistant sectors have poised Simon Property Group, Inc., Federal Realty Investment Trust and National Retail Properties, Inc. well for growth.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry embodies a group of REITs engaged in owning, developing, managing and renting space in a variety of retail real estates. Among these are regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and power centers, including big-box retailers.Also, net lease REITs enjoy the ownership of freestanding properties, wherein both rent and the majority of operating expenses for the properties are borne by tenants. The overall health of the economy, job market and consumer spending are the main drivers of retail REITs, while property locations and trade area demographics play key roles in demand determination. Dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies bothered this asset category in the past. However, shoppers' renewed enthusiasm for in-person shopping has helped the industry tide over.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?Inflationary Pressure, Rate Hike, Economic Slowdown to Make It Challenging: The retail real estate market is likely to remain challenging in the near term, given the inflationary pressure, higher interest rates and economic slowdown. Particularly, though inflation is moderating, it is still a concern as it is leading to the adoption of a more cautious spending attitude by consumers.Also, a slowdown in the job market and any potential impact on wage growth is likely to aggravate the woes, making shoppers more dependent on their savings and credit for purchases. Amid the uncertainty in the economic backdrop, the depletion of savings, the rising borrowing costs and the labor market pessimism, demand for retailers' goods is likely to dwindle. This, in turn, would temper the demand for the retail real estate space in the near term.Moreover, with a shortage of laborers, staffing of stores is likely to become challenging for retailers. Higher material and operating costs may remain as retailers' woes. These issues, in turn, are expected to moderate the demand for retail space as well as cast a pall on landlords' cash flows.Moreover, the dependence of REITs on debt for business is more compared to the other industries, making investors skeptical about their performance in a rising rate environment. Also, as the investment world treats REITs as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, these companies are susceptible to rising rates.Higher E-commerce Adoption to Remain a Concern: Consumers' habits have transformed at a rapid pace over the past years and traffic at retail real estates has suffered, with e-commerce capturing market share from brick-and-mortar stores. With the pandemic's impact waning, mall traffic has rebounded significantly. Yet, given the convenience it offers, online shopping is likely to remain a popular choice among customers. This might adversely impact the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Omni-Channel Strategy, Structural Changes in Focus: Omni-channel is the focal point for retailers. Physical stores will be a vital sales channel over the long run because though there is convenience in online shopping, it cannot replace the benefits and satisfaction of visiting a brick-and-mortar store. In fact, consumers these days prefer to research products online but buy or pick up in stores. Amid this, click-and-collect sales are likely to gain momentum.Moreover, digitally-native brands are likely to keep boosting their physical presence in the days to come as part of the omni-channel strategy since the opening of stores helps them to improve their connection with customers and drive expansion. Therefore, for retailers, the focus now is not only on increasing their online presence but also on maintaining brick-and-mortar stores in the best locations, which in turn is raising hopes for retail REITs that focus on such locations.Renewed Enthusiasm for In-Store Shopping Experience Amid Limited Supply to Aid Fundamentals: This industry is poised to benefit from the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers as they look for an exclusive in-store shopping experience following the pandemic downtime. However, comparing to the pre-pandemic levels, the construction of new retail space remains dreary amid high construction costs.Also, with struggling malls and centers' landlords opting for mixed-use developments over the past years, a sizeable part of retail space has been removed from the market. This limited supply is likely to support the retail real estate industry fundamentals even amidst the challenging economic backdrop and its corresponding impact on retail demand.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #169, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's FFO per share estimates for 2022 have declined 2.0%. The same for 2023 has moved 9.7% south over the past year.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Leads on Stock Market PerformanceThe REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Finance sector in a year's time.The industry has declined 1.2% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 8.7%. Meanwhile, the broader Finance sector has declined 7.8%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Retail REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.04X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 18.46X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 14.31X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.54X, as low as 10.32X, with a median of 15.28X.3 Retail REIT Stocks to ConsiderSimon Property Group: This retail REIT is a behemoth in its industry and enjoys a portfolio of premium retail assets in the United States and abroad. The adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers have been aiding the company. It is also tapping growth opportunities by assisting digital brands to enhance their brick-and-mortar presence, as well as capitalizing on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy.Additionally, Simon Property is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years among those who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Its better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels. Moreover, with solid balance-sheet strength and available capital resources, Simon Property Group looks poised to well navigate the challenges and bank on opportunities emanating from market dislocations.Simon Property Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). SPG has a long-term growth rate of 3.50%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share is currently pegged at $12.02, suggesting 1.3% growth year over year.

Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years.Federal Realty has expertise in raising its operating performance through conversion, redevelopment and repurposing of assets. Its focus on essential retail and mixed-use assets bodes well for long-term growth.Federal Realty's better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity and higher-than-expected revenues. This retail REIT provided an upbeat outlook for 2023, with FFO per share projection exceeding the consensus mark. Federal Realty also experienced strong small-shop leasing, ending the quarter at 90.0%. This marked an uptick of 260 bps year over year and the highest small-shop leased rate since the first quarter of 2017.Currently, FRT carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a long-term growth rate of 6.60%. Moreover, for 2023, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share being revised four cents upward to $6.38 over the past week. The stock has also gained 4.2% over the past three months.National Retail Properties, Inc.: This Orlando, FL-based retail REIT invests in high-grade retail properties subject usually to long-term net leases. NNN's portfolio comprised 3,411 owned properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of roughly 35.0 million square feet and with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years as of Dec 31, 2022.National Retail Properties' high-quality, diversified portfolio helps it to enjoy high occupancy. Also, long-term, net leases add stability to operating results, with tenants being responsible for operating expenses, taxes and capital expenditures.National Retail Properties' better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected higher-than-expected revenues. Moreover, its record-level property acquisitions in 2022, strong balance sheet position and steady free cash flow positions the company well to navigate any macroeconomic challenges in the current year.Currently, NNN carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term growth rate of 3.90%. Moreover, for 2023, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share being revised marginally upward to $3.26 over the past week.

The stock has also gained 4.7% in the past three months.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to see more most profitable utility stocks now, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now.In this article, we discuss utility companies in the United States.Utility companies provide essential services such as electricity, natural gas, and water.Given how essential the services are, many utility companies in the U.S. are regulated by the government in the United States. In exchange for providing services, many regulated utilities can get a return on their rate base decided by regulators.Sometimes the return on their rate base is better than expected. Sometimes the return on their rate base is worse than expected.S&amp;P Global explains rate base,A utility's rate base is essentially the company's ""prudent"" capital investment, as determined by the applicable regulatory authority’s net of accumulated depreciation. Stated differently, it is the net asset base from which the utility provides electric, gas or water service, and upon which the utility is allowed to earn a rate of return, usually the company's weighted average cost of capital. Thus, the rate base value is a key variable in the determination of a utility's revenue requirement.While there are many utilities that are regulated in the United States, there are also many deregulated utilities or unregulated utilities in the United States that don't get a return on their rate base, however, as competition ultimately decides how well they do.Regulations are also different in countries outside of the United States as every country is different in terms of how they regulate their utilities.Renewable EnergyGiven the need to invest in new renewable energy infrastructure to meet emission regulations, some leading regulated utilities have increased their rate base as a result. The increase in their rate base has allowed them to increase earnings.In terms of green energy, electric utility companies have also faced more competition as rooftop solar adoption has increased and increasing heat pumps adoption has also represented competition for natural gas companies. The effect of the competition is different for each utility, however, depending on whether a utility is regulated or deregulated, the effect of the regulations, and many other factors. In the long term, utilities may need to innovate to adjust to the changes. In the near term, however, many of the leading regulated utilities do have EPS growth potential if regulators allow them to grow their earnings.Story continuesAlthough leading regulated utility companies do have earnings growth potential in the near term, events like wildfires like what occurred to PG&amp;E could affect the utility's value and the industry does face more competition in the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Given the high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates substantially in 2022. As a result, U.S. treasury yields have increased considerably and substantial capital has moved from leading equities into the U.S. Treasury market. The capital outflow has decreased valuations for many stocks including many utilities.michaeljung/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now, we took the 15 most valuable utilities in the United States by market capitalization and we ranked them by the amount of net income (TTM) they had according to YCharts.Of the 15, we took the top 12.Because some companies have not posted their earnings results for Q4, the trailing twelve months for different companies might not be the same time frames as some could end in September 30 and some could end in December 31. Because we used YCharts data, the net income might not be adjusted income either.12 Most Profitable Utility Stocks Now12. American Water Works Company, Inc.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AWK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AWK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66% heading into earnings season.American Water Works Company, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Water Works Company, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest investment management firms in the world. In fact, as of December 2022, the firm had a whopping $18 billion in its portfolio invested in the stock market, and if you thought this was huge, then you'd be surprised to learn that the total assets management by Bridgewater Associates stood at $126 billion during the same time period according to data from Pensions and Investments. This made Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world and marked a strong 20% annual growth at a time when investor confidence in the stock market was low. Conversely, this growth during a turbulent time also shows confidence in Mr. Dalio and his firm, as investors were more confident about investing their money with Bridgewater when the broader market was underperforming.Naturally, the scope of its hedge fund and his accomplishments have also made Mr. Dalio a towering individual in the finance industry. He is also always willing to share his life experiences and management philosophy, not only having authored a book but also being present on Twitter where he shares tips daily for anyone willing to learn. One bit of advice that he recently shared tells viewers to take a look at themselves as part of a bigger picture and understand that an objective analysis will always yield the best results. In his own words:You are expected to go to the higher level and look down on yourself and others as part of a system. In other words, you must get out of your own head, consider your views as just some among many, and look down on the full array of points of view to assess them in an idea-meritocratic way rather than just in your own possessive way. Seeing things from the higher level isn't just seeing other people's point of view; it's also being able to see every situation, yourself, and others in the situation as though you were looking down on them as an objective observer.If you can do this well, you will see the situation as ""another one of those,"" see it through everyone's eyes, and have good mental maps or principles for deciding how to handle it.Story continuesAdditionally, the billionaire former hedge fund boss also believes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle which started last year will now usher in a new paradigm for the economy, where growth will be slower than desired and inflation will be higher than most would prefer. In fact, he believes that the era of borrowing funds to make long term bets might be over, as he shared advice on making the right bets this year in a recent LinkedIn post and outlined that:As for what seem to be the good and bad bets, it appears to me that the big power countries that are plagued with the big problems that I described, and the world as a whole, are in what I call Stage 5 of the Big Cycle—i.e., near the brinks of financial/economic crises and big internal conflicts/wars, and in the early part of an evolving, costly climate crisis—at the same time as the world is near the brink of having amazing technological breakthroughs that will affect our daily lives. Stage 5 is the last-chance stage before going into Stage 6 which is the financial crisis and war part of the cycle. It seems to me that that will make the environment very challenging for those who are following the traditional leveraged long approach to investing in traditional areas, while it will provide great opportunities in those geographic and subject areas that are benefiting from these changes.Whether it's life or investment, Ray Dalio is a guru, and while he stepped down as the fund's co-chief investment officer late last year, Bridgewater's bets as the new year starts are still worth looking at. Some companies that it has piled into are PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Ray Dalio Stock Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksOur MethodologyWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates' filing with the SEC for the fourth quarter of last year to determine which companies it has invested in.

In its place, Pepsi has launched Starry, which it seems to be hoping will catch on with Gen Z.So what does it taste like? Those who have compared the new drink to Sierra Mist say it’s actually quite different, with less sweetness and a crisper citrus taste. That puts it on common ground with Sprite, which might be deliberate, but could hurt Starry's chances of standing out.And standing out will be critical if it wants to be any sort of rival to Sprite, which has a 7% share of the soda market. Sprite has also caught a pop culture wave by regularly introducing offshoots of its primary flavor, including Winter Spiced Cranberry.Sierra Mist, introduced in 1999, never really found its place in the market. Seven years ago, Pepsi tried to shake things up, relabeling the drink Mist Twist. That fell flat, and it returned to its original name two years later.Indeed, even the drink's cancellation escaped the notice of many consumers.https://twitter.com/ChaffuDollaSign/status/1621995418002276352https://twitter.com/_iamlougotti/status/1623870852252024832https://twitter.com/FAEGR4VES/status/1625116533151133703Pepsi, as you might expect, is hoping customers will pay a bit more attention to Starry.“With one product dominating the category, consumers deserve another option…one that hits different.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 136% in five years.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 19% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years.

Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 19% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Grainger GWW, CDW Corp. CDW and East West Bancorp EWBC.Scoop Up These 4 GARP Stocks for Handsome ReturnsIf you are looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks offering the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to undervalued stocks with impressive prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial, W.W. Grainger, CDW Corp. and East West Bancorp are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach prefer buying stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsBoth a strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that both growth and GARP investors consider is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for a strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Story continuesUsing the GARP principle, we ran a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four of the six stocks that made it through the screening process:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice.

423,d5acd981-ddd3-38a2-ad23-12b48b06fe6d,AMP,2023-02-15,4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week High That Can Scale Higher,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-trading-near-52-122312867.html,1676377392,STORY,"['JBL', 'AIR', 'MRC', 'AMP']","[Investors generally consider a 52-week high as a good criterion to determine an entry or exit point for a given stock. However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as Ameriprise Financial AMP, AAR Corp. AIR, MRC Global MRC and Jabil JBL are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Story continuesCurrent Price/52 Week High &gt;= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1 or 2No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our four picks of the 25 stocks that made it through the screen:Ameriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company that offers a wide range of products and services focused on financial planning and advice. The company helps its individual and institutional clients achieve their financial objectives.The company remains well-positioned for impressive top-line growth on the back of its robust assets under management (AUM) balance and business restructuring initiatives. It constantly modifies its product and service-offering capacity to keep pace with dynamic market needs. This strategy, along with asset growth, has helped the company witness a rise in total net revenues.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMP’s 2023 earnings has increased 4.5% to $30.69 per share in the past 30 days, indicating growth of 22.08% year over year. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.5%.AAR Corp. provides various products and services to the aviation and defense industries worldwide. The company continues to witness strong performance in its parts supply and program activities. Recovery of demand in the commercial and leisure travel market should continue to contribute to its operating results. The latest agreement with Collins Aerospace may allow it to gain from growth opportunities in the jet market. The stock holds a strong solvency position in the near term.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIR’s fiscal 2023 earnings has remained steady at $3.03 per share in the past 30 days, indicating growth of 27.3% year over year. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.17%.MRC Global is one of the leading distributors of pipes, valves and fittings, and related products and services. The company is poised to benefit from strength in its gas utilities sector due to long-term market drivers like distribution integrity upgrade programs and new home construction.  The DIET sector is likely to gain from new energy transition-related projects, project turnaround activity along with maintenance, repair and operations activities. The company’s focus on expanding market share, enhancing profitability and boosting working capital efficiency is encouraging.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRC Global’s 2023 earnings has remained steady at $1.15 per share in the past 30 days, indicating growth of 325.9% year over year. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion and missing the same on the other, the average surprise being 102.98%.Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services. The company is benefiting from strong demand in key end markets with excellent operational execution and skillful management of supply chain dynamics. It is likely to witness healthy top-line growth owing to secular tailwinds in healthcare, automotive, industrial, 5G and cloud businesses. Jabil’s focus on end-market and product diversification is a key catalyst. Its Photonics business unit and EFFECT Photonics have joined forces to develop next-generation coherent optical modules, which will likely drive top-line expansion.The company currently has a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JBL’s fiscal 2023 earnings has remained steady at $8.37 per share in the past 30 days, indicating growth of 9.41% year over year. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.78%.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

426,ca296244-2d95-36f7-9148-17b5ae0f5325,CSCO,2023-02-15,Cisco: A Love Letter to Planet Earth,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-love-letter-planet-earth-144500798.html,1676385900,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 14, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Tuesday, February 14, 2023, Press release pictureI grew up 228 miles northwest of New York City in a rural village dotted with small farms. It was in this environment that I felt closest to planet Earth. I spent summers barefoot, with my toes between blades of grass. At night I could hear the small chorus frogs (also known as the spring peeper) while fireflies danced in the field behind our house. My third-grade teacher would take us on long walks in the woods, sharing her knowledge about every insect, animal, and plant we saw. My mom carefully tended her garden, growing lots of healthy vegetables for us to eat and composting leftover scraps.I didn't feel a distinct separation between nature and our home life because we could open our windows or doors and instantly experience singing birds, swaying trees, and rolling hills. When I went away to college and moved to a more urban environment, I felt pulled away from that oneness with Earth. I now had to make an effort to spend time outside or walk in the woods. And when I started my career, sometimes I felt like I didn't have the time or energy to immerse myself in nature. I still did some small acts of kindness for Earth, like recycling, unplugging devices I wasn't using, or taking cloth bags to the grocery store. As the news about climate change grew worse, I started to feel guilty. I had the privilege of enjoying all the beauty and resources that planet Earth offers us but didn't take enough actions to improve her health.Now working on sustainability communications, I'm working more closely with issues around the climate crisis. At the same time, I also see dedicated people working hard to make a difference for the planet. Collaborating with these amazing individuals across Cisco is not only inspiring but motivating as well. There is the saying that ""actions speak louder than words,"" so instead of continuing to profess my love for Earth, I want to share five actions Cisco is taking to help create a more sustainable and regenerative future for our planet:Story continuesCisco's net zero goalAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""), heat is retained in the atmosphere because greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions trap some of Earth's outgoing energy. This trapped heat alters climate and weather patterns, which can lead to more frequent and more severe natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and droughts.Net zero is a state where we add no incremental GHGs to the atmosphere. In September 2021, Cisco set a goal to reach net zero GHG emissions across its value chain by reducing our absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions 90% by 2040 compared to our 2019 fiscal year, and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere. And, we have near-term targets that support the net zero goal that you can learn more about in Cisco´s 2022 Purpose Report and related supplemental information located on our environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") Reporting Hub.Cisco's 2040 net zero goal and near-term targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (""SBTi"") under its Net-Zero Standard. SBTi validation means we must prioritize deep emissions reductions required by climate science, and can use offsets for no more than 10 percent of our emissions reduction.Improving product energy efficiencyAs a large, global company, we want to do our part to decrease the GHG emissions associated with our business and help our customers do the same.Because many of our products operate 24/7 and stay in use for several years, the majority of our emissions result from our customers' use of our products. Cisco is looking into how our products can use less energy while performing at the same standard. According to the U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy, one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to address climate change is through energy efficiency.To reduce the emissions associated with the use of our products, we are making improvements in four key areas: power; thermal (i.e., the heat they generate); high-speed interconnects and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (""ASICs""); and integration into our customer facilities (read more in our Purpose Report and ESG Reporting Hub).Reducing our use of plasticsAccording to the United Nations Environmental Programme (""UNEP""), around ""7 billion of the 9.2 billion tonnes of plastic produced from 1950-2017 became plastic waste, ending up in landfills or dumped.""Virgin plastics are made from materials that have never been used or processed. In fiscal year 2021, we exceeded our goal to decrease use of virgin plastics in products by 20% compared to a fiscal year 2018 base year. Building on the momentum and key learnings from this goal, we recently set a new goal that by our fiscal year 2025, 50% of the plastic used in our products (by weight) will be made of recycled content. The plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables).As part of our journey to minimize the use of virgin plastic, our teams are sourcing more recycled plastic parts and designing our products to reduce the need for plastic parts more generally. For example, select models of our 8800 Series IP phones consist of 68% recycled plastic, and some products in our Catalyst series of network switches were designed without bezels, the plastic cosmetic surface on the outside of a device.Increasing our use of renewable electricityAccording to the UN, the main cause of climate change is society's reliance on energy generated from fossil fuels, and renewable energy like wind and solar can help us tackle the climate crisis.Cisco operations account for only 1% of our total GHG emissions. However, we remain committed to reducing GHG emissions in our operations by procuring renewable electricity and improving the efficiency of our offices, laboratories, and data centers.Increasing our use of renewable electricity is a fundamental part of our strategy. In fiscal year 2022, 89% of our global electricity came from renewable energy sources, including 100% in the United States, Canada, and several European countries. We are ramping up both our onsite and offsite renewable energy efforts, targeting approximately 5 MW of new onsite solar and securing over 500 MW of new long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of fiscal year 2025. We are actively evaluating long-term power purchase agreements (""PPAs"") in India and Europe that would collectively add over 100 MW of new solar and wind developments to these regions.Making it easy to return products for reuse and recyclingAccording to the UNEP, ""The world produces as much as 50 million tonnes of electronic and electrical waste (e-waste) a year, weighing more than all commercial airliners ever made. Only 20% of this is formally recycled.""Cisco has had programs for over two decades to facilitate product returns for reuse and recycling, offer comprehensive service and repair, and remanufacture used equipment for sale through Cisco Refresh. These programs can create a second life for equipment, saving the resources required for new manufacturing and reducing waste.In fiscal year 2022, Cisco Capital launched Cisco Green Pay, a circular IT payment solution that makes it easier for customers to build a sustainable technology strategy. It provides a path for customers of all sizes to acquire Cisco sustainable solutions. The program offers predictable payments for five years, with a 5% incentive on equipment at the outset, while Cisco retains ownership. This and our other long-standing programs focused on product return and reuse help us make progress toward our PACE Capital Equipment pledge.Steps you can take to show planet Earth that you careWant to give planet Earth some love today and every day? Here are ten actions from ActNow, a UN campaign for individual action on climate change, that you can take:Save energy at home by using LED light bulbs, washing laundry with cold water, and switching to energy-efficient appliances.Walking, biking, or taking public transit will reduce GHG emissions, and carpooling is also an option when you need to use a vehicle.Eating more vegetables can significantly lower your environmental impact since plant-based foods can be produced with less energy, land, and water.Consider how you travel, especially since airplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels. When you can, meet virtually or avoid long-distance trips.Throw away less food because food that ends up in a landfill produces methane, a potent GHG. It is best to only buy what you need and compost leftovers.Reduce, reuse, repair and recycle when you can because electronics, clothing, and other things we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in their production.Change your home's energy source by installing solar panels on your roof or asking your utility company for other renewable options.Switch to an electric vehicle (""EV"") to help reduce air pollution since EVs cause significantly less GHG emissions.Make your money count by purchasing from companies that use resources responsibly and are committed to reducing emissions and waste.Speaking up and getting neighbors, colleagues, friends, and family to take action is one of the simplest and most effective ways to make a difference.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/739297/Cisco-A-Love-Letter-to-Planet-Earth]"

CSCO may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cisco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CSCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 87 cents per share for CSCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CSCO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.66% heading into earnings season.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCisco Systems, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCisco Systems, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CSCO has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cisco, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

428,87601ebe-bd85-37d4-a85e-963419977881,CSCO,2023-02-15,Weatherford International and Chesapeake Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weatherford-international-chesapeake-energy-highlighted-133601034.html,1676381761,STORY,"['WFRD', 'CHK', '^GSPC', 'CSCO']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – February 14, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Weatherford International WFRD as the Bull of the Day and Chesapeake Energy CHK as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Cisco Systems CSCO, Salesforce CRM and Airbnb ABNB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Oil field services and equipment provider Weatherford International is standing out among a dominant industry sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).While the Zacks Oils &amp; Energy Sector is currently ranked 14th out of 16 industries, Weatherford International's Oil and Gas – Field Services Industry is currently in the top 22% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Studies show that much of a stock's future appreciation is attributed to the company's ability to benefit from a booming business industry, which should benefit Weatherford International. This also helps investors differentiate and select sound investments among oil and energy stocks after many of these equities have outperformed the broader market over the last few years.Still, with oil prices remaining high relative to historical levels (currently at $79 a barrel) there is an abundance of upside remaining for select companies and industries. Weatherford International, for example, is showing continued momentum after securing over $6.5 billion worth of contracts in 2022.Furthermore, past performance is not always an indicator of future success, and after being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 and trading on the OTC Pink Market, Weatherford International was added to the Nasdaq in 2021 and is now up over 400%.Weatherford is carving a unique niche in the industry with its drilling solutions, gas well unloading, and restoration among other services.Redemption &amp; Operational HighlightsWeatherford blasted Q4 bottom-line expectations last week by 33% with earnings at $1.12 per share compared to -$0.63 in Q4 2021. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.20 billion up 24% year over year. Operating Income was at $169 million, up 6% from the third quarter and 290% YoY.Story continuesOverall, Weatherford posted many significant milestones in 2022:It was the first time in over three decades that positive free cash flow was generated for three consecutive years. Weatherford achieved its lowest net leverage ratio in more than 15 years. It also grew its revenue year-over-year by 19% for the highest growth rate in over 10 years  And it generated a positive net income of $26 million, a first in 10 years.After capping off fiscal 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, Weatherford highlighted the diverse regions in which it has secured operational services. This included a five-year contract with Kuwait Oil company to provide directional drilling and logging while drilling services, providing fit-for-purpose solutions.Weatherford anonymously announced another major integrated oil company (IOC) in the middle east awarded the company with a five-year contract to provide ""fishing"" equipment and services.Also, the company inked a two-year, sole-provider contract with Petrobras for the provision of Weatherford's newly enhanced chemical injection system to help solve some of the drilling issues Petrobras is facing in Brazil.In addition to this, Weatherford stated it was awarded three other contracts in Latin America to deliver integrated drilling and completing services in onshore and offshore operations, including shallow water developments and exploration wells.Earnings Estimate Revisions For Weatherford, a booming business environment leads to lucrative contracts, and this correlates with rising earnings estimate revisions which is another significant catalyst in the upward movement of a stock.On that note, Weatherford's fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have gone up 44% to $3.99 per share in the last week following its fourth-quarter report. Fiscal 2024 earnings estimates have gone up 40% to $5.59 per share over the last seven days.TakeawayWeatherford International's Growth and Momentum are very intriguing at the moment, scoring an ""A"" Zacks Style Scores grade in both of these complementary stock trading indicators alongside its impressive Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Also, with WFRD stock trading at 16.7X forward earnings and estimates on the rise, this is getting the company closer to the industry average of 13.6X. This is also well below its high of 169.7X since being publicly traded again along with its stock performance topping most of its peers.Management is effectively deploying its turnaround initiatives, and showing the ability to secure meaningful contracts that can boost the company's top and bottom lines which could certainly lead to more upside in Weatherford International's stock.Bear of the Day:Chesapeake Energy currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with its Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States Industry currently in the bottom 3% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Although many stocks in the broader Zacks Oils &amp; Energy sector have largely outperformed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark in recent years, some of these equities may be due for a pullback. Investors will want to be cautious of companies that may not be able to continue benefiting even as oil prices have remained high.Business &amp; Industry Overview Chesapeake Energy and others could continue to be affected by lower demand for drilling and discovery operations in regard to oil and natural gas. As a result of oil prices remaining high along with reserve supplies, the need for additional drilling is declining at the moment.Overall, proved reserves of U.S. crude oil and lease condensate increased by 6.2 billion barrels at the end of 2022, up 16% from 38.2 billion barrels at year-end 2021 to 44.4 billion barrels. This comes after historical highs among oil reserves were seen in 2020 due to extremely low demand for oil and energy during the pandemic.Additionally, the natural gas market has been very volatile as prices have unreliably fluctuated in recent weeks with reserves higher as well and demand lower from a mild winter.Declining Earnings EstimatesIn correlation with higher reserves leading to a dimmer outlook for Chesapeake and its business industry, CHK's earnings estimates have alarmingly gone down.As Chesapeake wraps up fiscal 2022 with Q4 earnings on February 21, FY23 earnings estimates have plummeted 57% over the last quarter to $9.15 per share compared to $21.13 a share 90 days ago. This could continue to negatively impact CHK's stock performance and valuation.Recent Performance &amp; ValuationYear to date, CHK stock is down -11% to lag the S&amp;P 500's +6% and the broader Oils and Energy Market's +3% with the Nasdaq up +13%. More concerning, over the last three months, CHK stock is now down -16% to largely underperform the broader indexes and the Oils and Energy Market as the company continues to give back gains in recent years.Trading around $83 per share, Chesapeake stock trades at 9.1X forward earnings but estimates are continuing to decline and CHK is at its P/E high following a 1 for 200 reverse stock split in April of 2020. Plus, Chesapeake stock currently trades 30% above its median of 6.9X during this period and 49% above the industry average of 6.1X forward earnings.Bottom Line There is certainly short-term risk ahead for Chesapeake Energy stock with oil and natural gas reserves spiking. It is also important to note that investors will want to monitor management's adjustment to a potentially dimmer outlook as the investment value, market capitalization, and per-share price of CHK stock have been volatile in recent history as indicated in its 2020 reverse stock split.Additional content:Key Factors to Consider When Cisco (CSCO) Reports EarningsCisco Systems is set to release its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 15.The company anticipates second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues to increase in the range of 4.5-6.5% on a year-over-year basis.
