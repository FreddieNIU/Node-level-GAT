JPMorgan raised its target from $330 to $390 maintaining its Overweight rating and Evercore ISI raised its target from $340 to $400 maintaining its Outperform rating.

1,8d2f3494-a303-3b35-9a3e-f6deccae32b2,WDC,2023-01-23,11 Tech Stocks With Low PE Ratio,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-tech-stocks-low-pe-205849524.html,1674421129,STORY,"['SWKS', 'FLEX', 'STX', 'WDC', 'NTAP', 'AMAT']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 11 tech stocks with low PE ratio. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Tech Stocks With Low PE Ratio.Tech stocks were crushed in 2022 amid a major growth stock rout that started when market optimism began to recede amid rising inflation, rate hikes, supply chain issues and Russia-Ukraine war. However, some analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. If it does, tech stocks with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations could bring strong returns for shareholders. According to a Bloomberg report published in December, several notable analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. In a Bloomberg News survey, about 71% of respondents said they think US equities would rise in the year, versus 19% forecasting declines. The survey included 134 fund managers, including those from BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Amundi SA. However, the respondents said that the stock market could again get hit if inflation persists or if the economy goes into deep recession.The report quoted Pia Haak, chief investment officer at Sweden’s Swedbank Robur. The analyst said even though the economy might face a recession and falling profits in 2023, they have already discounted part of it in 2022.“We will have better visibility coming into 2023 and this will hopefully help markets,” Haak added.However, the market recovery won’t be easy or smooth, many analysts believe. Mislav Matejka, a global equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. believes the risks the stock market saw in 2022 aren’t over and this makes the analyst “nervous about the outlook” of 2023, especially for the first half of the period, according to a separate Bloomberg report.A latest report from investment firm Stifel also gives an opportunity to get an idea about what to expect in 2023. The firm said it expects economic growth to be muted in 2023.  It still sees a “reasonable” chance of a soft landing but an equal chance of a mild recession. The report said that job losses and volatility would offset the wage gains and consumer benefits from decreasing inflation in 2023.Story continuesThe Stifel report said that as we will move into mid-2023, investors can begin to see a new “growth cycle” fueled by optimism if the Federal Reserve decides to stop rate hikes and China continues policy of economic reopening after lifting COVID restrictions. These factors, according to the report, can lift the stock market higher in 2023. Stifel expects earnings growth in the 0%–5% range for 2023. The firm also expects S&amp;P 500 total return of roughly 6% and a related price target of 4,000 at year-end.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to identify tech stocks with PE ratios under 15.

In December, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, mentioned several stocks as favorable semiconductor picks for 2023 and Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was one of them. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is also a dividend stock. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in December declared a $0.26/share quarterly dividend. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 0.95%. The dividend was payable March 16 for shareholders of record February 23.As of the end of the third quarter, 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT).10. Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX)P/E Ratio: 13.63Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) is a Singapore-based manufacturing company that has performed pretty well over the past year, gaining 31%. Still, Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) has a low PE ratio when compared to peers. Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) is one of the biggest electronics manufacturing services and OEM companies in the world in terms of revenue. Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) has a diversified business model as it’s involved in lucrative markets including automotive, consumer healthcare, robotics and power. In October, Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) posted its second quarter results, according to which its adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.63, beating estimates by $0.12. Revenue in the quarter jumped 25% to reach $7.77 billion, beating estimates by $550 million. For Q3, Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX) expects revenue to come in between $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, versus consensus of $7.27 billion.9. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) P/E Ratio: 12.94Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Yet another semiconductor stock in our list, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) has lost about 33% over the past year. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)’ management is trying to cut the company's reliance on mobile revenue. As of FY’22, Broad market revenue accounts for about 36% of the total revenue of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Back in November, investment firm KGI Securities analyst Derek Chang upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target.A total of 39 hedge funds out of the 920 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). The total value of these stakes was $964 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest stakeholder of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), with a $142.4 million stake.Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)P/E Ratio: 12.91Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is one of the famous data storage products companies in the world. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has lost about 44% in value over the past year. However, some catalysts point to possible growth in the near future. Earlier this month, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller increased his rating for Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) to Hold from Sell after media reports suggested Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has re-started merger talks with Japan's Kioxia. The analyst said that the memory chip market may be headed towards a recovery from one of the “worst downturn in years”. However, the analyst warned investors that some factors can still delay this possible rebound. These factors include expectations that the PC, data center and mobile chip sales would continue to remain soft in 2023.7. Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX)P/E Ratio: 11.12Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Data storage products company Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX)’s shares have taken a beating over the past year, losing almost half of their value. Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) is also expected to continue to suffer from the volatility in the data storage market in the months to come. That’s why Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is only suitable for those who are willing to wait. In November, after Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) conducted a debt exchange to boost its balance sheet, Susquehanna updated its estimates for Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX). According to new estimates, the investment firm expects Seagate’s fiscal 2023 earnings per share to be $1.79, down from a prior view of $1.87 and below the consensus estimate of $1.98 per share.As of the end of the third quarter, 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX). The total value of these stakes was $1.1 billion.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Within cyclical technology, disk drive makers Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (WDC) were hurt by an inventory correction due to slowing growth in their core PC and server markets as well as uneven demand from hyperscale cloud providers who are watching their budgets. While these two stocks remain inexpensive on a valuation basis, they clearly saw a business slowdown over the last two quarters.”6. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)P/E Ratio: 9.82Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is a hybrid Cloud and data management company. Over the past 12 months NetApp, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) posted mixed quarterly results and gave weak guidance, the stock fell. However, investment firm Citi said the drop created a buying opportunity. The firm believes NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is continuously gaining market share.  Citi’s analyst Jim Suva said in a note that the weak guidance was due to the global macro environment and foreign currency headwinds. He thinks that company is well-positioned within cloud storage market. The analyst has a $110 price target on NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) with a Buy rating.As of the end of the third quarter, 36 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP).

O'Hanley: Thank you Ilene and good morning everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world's investors and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets impacted by the war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds including bulk of supply chains, price and wage inflations, dramatically higher global interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of global economic recession which remain today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year decline in global financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows.Despite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in 2022 towards achieving our medium term targets. Our durable 4Q and full year 2022 results were driven by a strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition, and State Street's diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet another year of strong, organic net new servicing wins. As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor presentation shows our full year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in 2022. In a challenging operating environment and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in 2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion, and a higher return on equity as you can see on the left of the slide.We drove continued business momentum, including 1.9 trillion of total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth, and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our businesses, as you can see on the right and bottom of the slide. While weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses combined with higher interest rates and our deposit strategy produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign exchange trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year fee growth, manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the revenue diversification of our business model.Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 434 billion driven by broad based wins across client segments. We reported two new alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing alpha relationships, seven of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by this sales performance our AUC/A installation backlog was 3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors quarter end assets under management totaled 3.5 trillion, supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows. Turning to our fourth quarter financial performance, 4Q 2022 EPS was 1.91 or 2.07 excluding notable items, up 7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year excluding notable items.The year-over-year EPS growth in a challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year as lower total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result which increased 63% relative to the year ago, primarily driven by higher global interest rates plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our deposit management strategy. As we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year, excluding notable items, in part supported by the stronger U.S. dollar.This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational productivity, simplification and automation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year end. Recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders and having already announced a 10% per share increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, buying back a total of 1.5 billion of State Street's common stock. For 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy, and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range.Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock purchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pretax margin expansion and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our financial goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail before I discuss our strategic priorities for 2023.Eric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind down expenses related to the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing. Second, we recognize 70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of 50 million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions, largely related to our investment services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized 20 million of occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs.We expect these actions to generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million. Lastly, we recognize the benefit of 23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together, we recognize notable items of $78 million pretax, or $0.16 a share. Now, turning to Slide 6, I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in today's presentation.We also continued to demonstrate prudent expense management, which enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter and pretax margin is up more than four percentage points year-on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment we saw in 2022 for the year, I am quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage and nearly a percentage point improvement in pretax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been three consecutive years of margin expansion and ROE improvement. Turning to Slide 7, during the quarter we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 3% sequentially.Year-on-year the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter end equity market levels and the positive impact of currency translation. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, some institutional net outflows, and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by 22 billion of net inflows in our SPDR ETF business.Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily due to higher quarter end market levels, ETF net inflows, and the positive impact of currency translation, partially offset by cash net outflows. Turning to Slide 8, on the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows, normal pricing headwinds, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows. On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlights the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter.As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a solid 434 billion driven by strong broad based traditional wins across client segments and regions, including expanding relationships with existing alpha clients. At quarter-end AUC/A won but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion, with alpha representing a healthy portion, which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees were 457 million down 14% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about two percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds.As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs we saw solid full year net inflows in the U.S. with continued momentum and market share gains in the SPDR low cost equity and fixed income segments. In our institutional business, there's a continued momentum and defined contribution with 48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net inflows of 21 billion, offset by industry wide outflows in Institutional Index products. In our cash franchise, we still gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in fourth quarter.On Slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago, fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid market environment which was driven by sharp moves in the U.S. dollar. Sequentially FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue. Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year. Sequentially revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower special activity and year-end risk of activity by clients.Fourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of 18 million in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up 23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of negative market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 11, on the left panel you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software enabled revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud based SaaS platform environment.Research, Investment, FinanceResearch, Investment, FinanceTurning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, the 21 million of new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners, wealth and private markets as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front office revenue, backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we are pleased to report to two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner of client segments. Now turning to Slide 12, fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to 791 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short and long term market interest rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits.We have a well-constructed balance sheet including both U.S. and foreign client deposits, a scale of sponsored repo franchise, and high quality loan and investment portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet. On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation impacts. The U.S. client's deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives was about 65% to 70% during the fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower in the 20% to 50% range depending on currency.Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially. We saw sequential quarter reduction in non-interest bearing deposits of 5% which was more than offset by higher NII accretive interest bearing deposits that will help support high quality client loan growth and selective expansion of the investment portfolio. Turning the Slide 13, fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items were once again proactively managed in light of a tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts which generated approximately 90 million in year-on-year growth savings for the quarter or approximately 320 million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%.These savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion, which while partially offsetting continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including alpha, private markets, technology, and operations automation. On a line by line basis compared to 4Q 2021 compensation employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we added operations personnel to support growth areas such as alpha and private markets, invested in technology talent, and in sourced certain functions.There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount to increase more modestly in 2023. Information systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by lower sub custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17% largely due to an episodic lease back real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers which was worth approximately 12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and travel costs.Moving to Slide 14, on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWA's, it's worth noting that we saw unusually low RWA this quarter worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets, businesses and some specific currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the 10th $15 billion range going into first quarter.Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end, was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the resumption of share repurchases in fourth quarter. We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of a 1.5 billion of common share repurchases and 220 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent. Turning the Slide 15, let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in.In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect some point to point growth in global equity markets in 2023, which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% per Fed funds, 3.25 at the ECB, and 4.5 at the Bank of England. As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translations like to have 0.5 point or less impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex-notable items with servicing fees likely flattish and management fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue, other fees, and NII.Regarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex-notable items on a sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expect to be down 1% to 2%. We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is dependent of course on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step up in fourth quarter 2022 NII, we expect first quarter 2023 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a slide 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with the stabilization expected in 2024.Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the business and our people, while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the walk that for a full year 2023, we expect growth saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and alpha and further automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up about 2%. Finally, taxes should be in the 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium term target goal of 30%, as well as deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders.And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe, and developed world inflation may have peaked. We proceed continued rising interest rates in the short term, but at a slower pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia Ukraine War, China from an economic performance and policy perspective, and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling. Turning to Slide 17, even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023 focusing on what we can control.We plan to deliver further growth, drive innovation, and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards its medium term targets. First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street's alpha value proposition and enhancing its private markets capabilities. As we aim to become the leading investment service or platform and enterprise outsource solutions provider in the industry, we intend to maintain and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In global markets, we aim to expand wallet share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing, and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth efforts in fast growing segments where we can win.Second, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization as we build out a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a core differentiator of our value proposition. Third, we must continue to build a higher performing organization. We are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability, thereby fostering an even more results oriented culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first three priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals, meaning another year of positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and higher returns.To conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings, as well as our ability to manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe that we will be able to execute on each of these strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential partner to the world's investors and the people they serve. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions.See also 10 Most Advanced Battery Technologies and 10 Best Healthcare Stocks for Recession.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

5,698b92ad-381f-3966-a505-5834c07c2d6f,TMO,2023-01-23,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) insiders sold US$4.9m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-120020383.html,1674475220,STORY,['TMO'],"[The fact that multiple Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher ScientificOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$542 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$594). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 28% of Michel Lagarde's stake.In the last year Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Thermo Fisher Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Thermo Fisher Scientific shares. In total, Independent Director Debora Spar dumped US$112k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own about US$331m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Thermo Fisher Scientific Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Thermo Fisher Scientific stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific you should be aware of.Of course Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:RJF) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 76%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-inc-nyse-114100239.html,1674474060,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE:RJF), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Raymond James Financial, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Raymond James Financial?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Raymond James Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Raymond James Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Raymond James Financial. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. With 8.9% and 8.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, Thomas James and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Raymond James FinancialThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Raymond James Financial, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$2.4b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Raymond James Financial. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Raymond James Financial , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

13,f22e6560-15ef-3510-abda-f4bf67547464,NCLH,2023-01-23,3 Stocks to Keep an Eye on for Superb Earnings Acceleration,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-keep-eye-superb-111411453.html,1674472451,STORY,"['NCLH', 'BLUE']","[Incessant earnings growth captivates almost everyone in the investment world, right from the top brass to research analysts. This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Still, earnings acceleration works better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t yet caught the attention of investors. Once secured, it will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may, at times, drag prices down.Screening ParametersLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).Story continuesEPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 17. Here are three stocks from the 17 to keep an eye on:bluebird bio BLUE is focused on developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. Presently, BLUE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Both contracts were coming off a second straight week of gains.Focus this week now turns to U.S. fourth quarter GDP data due on Thursday to gauge whether the world’s largest economy drew closer to a recession in late-2022. Growth is expected to have slowed in the fourth quarter from the third, as the effects of a sharp rise in interest rates were felt by the economy.While a recovery in China is expected to benefit crude demand this year, markets fear that a potential recession in the U.S. and other Western majors could hamper crude consumption. U.S. and Eurozone economies are struggling with elevated inflation and tight monetary policy, both of which are expected to persist for a bulk of the year.Economic indicators for December already indicate a cooling in activity, likely heralding a bigger downturn in the coming months.On the supply side, focus is squarely on Russia, as the country copes with strict price caps on its oil exports. Moscow is widely expected to scale down crude production as its margins are hit by weaker selling prices.Story continuesThis in turn could tighten global crude supply, providing some upside to prices.Related ArticlesOil prices drift lower in thin trade as markets weigh China reopeningBrazil declares emergency over deaths of Yanomami children from malnutritionCanada's energy jobs transition bill sparks discord in oil heartland]"

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETA Weekend Bitcoin Spurt Past $23KBy James RubinBitcoin continued its recent buoyancy over the weekend, rising over $23,000 at one point – BTC's first time above the threshold since early August – before retreating late Sunday.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $22,750, roughly flat for the last 24 hours but up more than 8% during the past week. Bitcoin has risen roughly 37% this year as investors dismiss various crypto industry headwinds, most recently Genesis Global Holdco LLC filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although in an email to CoinDesk Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said the rise was typical for first quarters and noted ""a long consolidation period that saw shorts accumulating.""""The market has risen, partially fueled the short squeeze,"" DiPasquale wrote, adding that ""bitcoin and several altcoins are overheated and due for a correction. ""We wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin testing $20,000 in the coming days.""""For the week ahead, market participants should be mindful of downside risks and potentially seek to take profits.""Ether followed a similar weekend path and was recently changing hands near $1,640, up about 1% from Saturday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value is up approximately 4.5% for the past week and 35% since Dec. 31.Story continuesMost other major cryptos assumed a light green hue, although AXS, the token of the Axie Infinity gaming platform, and YGG, the native crypto of play-to-earn gaming guild Yield Guild Games, were up more than 38% and 18%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of leading cryptos' market performance, was up slightly.Cryptos' weekend rise followed a positive Friday for equity indexes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, which has a strong technology component, jumped 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Traditional asset markets have looked optimistically at mounting evidence that inflation is waning without casting the economy into a steep recession, and are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be ratcheting back its next interest rate hike to 25 basis points (bps) from its more recent diet of 75 and 50 bps increases.Meanwhile, Signature Bank will not handle crypto transactions larger than $100,000, according to a Bloomberg report that cited a statement from exchange giant Binance. In a statement to Bloomberg, Binance said that Signature, which has been looking to reduce its exposure to crypto markets, would ""no longer support any crypto exchange customers with buying and well amounts less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023."" Binance said that this would be ""the case for all Signature's crypto exchange clients"" and noted that some users might ""not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD"" is smaller amounts.In recent weeks, Signature, which has ranked among the most crypto-friendly banks, and other financial services firms have been reducing their exposure to crypto, part of the widening fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion. In December, Signature's CEO said the bank would shrink its deposits tied to cryptocurrencies by $8 billion to $10 billion.Nearly a quarter of the New York-based bank’s $103 billion in total deposits, or roughly 23.5%, came from the crypto industry as of September 2022. But given the recent “issues” in the space, Signature will reduce that amount to under 20% and potentially under 15% eventually, Signature's Joe DePaolo said at an investor conference hosted by investment bank Goldman Sachs.Despite his cautious outlook for the week, BitBull's DiPasquale was more sanguine about the crypto ""market's appetite for risk.""""This is a positive sign for an eventual recovery, but we believe that may need more time and could materialize by end of the year,"" he wrote.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA+8.6%EntertainmentLoopringLRC+5.9%Smart Contract PlatformDogecoinDOGE+5.4%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL−1.8%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC−0.1%CurrencyInsightsMicrosoft Exits the Mixed Reality Space – at Least for NowBy Sam ReynoldsBig tech is making massive cuts to its headcount, and Microsoft is no exception. While layoffs were to be expected at the computing giant as it follows the rest of its peers, they have impacted a specific segment of the company, which might impact exactly what the future idea of the metaverse looks like.As Windows Central reports, Microsoft has laid off its entire mixed reality team, which was behind its virtual reality, augmented reality and HoloLens – its enterprise-focused augmented reality headset – efforts. This includes AltSpace VR, Microsoft’s social VR platform which competes with Horizon Worlds.Microsoft called its augmented and virtual reality efforts ""mixed reality,"" and given the company’s size and scale, it probably had the best shot of making this a new computing paradigm. Microsoft Teams, used widely for collaboration, was fully integrated into the HoloLens as of December.But the metaverse proved to be a struggle for Microsoft.While Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) has gone for the retail side of virtual reality and the metaverse, Microsoft has gone for enterprise users. The premiere enterprise client for the HoloLens was supposed to be the U.S. Army, but Congress isn’t so hot on the idea because test results have been mixed, which has led to limited funding. The head of HoloLens at Microsoft left around the middle of the year. If you’re bullish on the idea that the metaverse includes some sort of headset for virtualized reality, this isn’t very good for that thesis.The struggle to catch onVR/AR is far from new, but found new energy when venture capitalists invented the term ""metaverse"" (to be sure, the metaverse doesn’t necessarily need to include VR or AR).In the gaming world, VR has struggled to evolve past its status as a niche product. Headset sales have been growing since their widespread introduction in 2016, but this growth has slowed. In late December, consultancy IDC published a new forecast for AR/VR headsets that shows slowing growth for the medium.Enterprise should have been where VR/AR – and thus the metaverse – succeeded. But this doesn’t really seem to have caught on either. Microsoft chose to axe these teams when it needed to reduce spending because executives, privy to nonpublic numbers and discussions with potential customers, apparently didn’t see the value the medium.The unmentioned issue here is Apple’s presence. Apple has the potential ability to make a market for a product that others have tried to do and struggled. Remember, the iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone. Palm, Microsoft and Nokia had internet-connected PDAs and phones out before Apple entered the arena. But all of these were largely forgettable compared to the iPhone.Apple still plans to enter the metaverse in 2024-2025 with a mixed-reality headset, according to a report from Bloomberg. Its original plan of building AR glasses has been postponed due to technical challenges, but the company is still committed.By the time Apple enters the market, perhaps in 2025, VR/AR would have been around for a decade. Any other medium with such limited performance would be labeled a niche and the market would move on, not giving it much attention. The question is, can Apple change this where the likes of Microsoft and HTC have struggled?The idea of the metaverse with a headset displaying a virtualized form of reality is counting on this.Important events9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Chicago Fed National Activity Index (Dec)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) European Commission Consumer Confidence (Jan) 6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) Australia S&amp;P Global Servies PMI (Jan)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Genesis' Crypto Lending Businesses File for Bankruptcy, Winklevoss Threatens Legal Action Against DCGBitcoin (BTC) held around $21,000 as Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of troubled cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

The activist investor Starboard Value disclosed taking a significant stake in the business software maker in October 2022 to increase profitability. Starboard believes that CRM has not taken advantage of its position as a market leader and lags in profitability compared with its peers.To cut costs and improve profitability, Salesforce announced a broader restructuring plan in early January 2022. Under the plan, it intends to lay off approximately 10% of its total global workforce, exit real estate and shut down office spaces in certain markets.Salesforce’s current restructuring plan will include $1.0-$1.4 billion in charges for employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and share-based compensation. Further, the plan will encompass $450-$650 million in exit charges related to office space reductions.The San Francisco, CA-based company expects to incur $1.4-$2.1 billion in charges over its restructuring plan. Out of this, $800 million to $1.0 billion is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuoteWhy Are Investors Interested in CRM Stock?We believe that Salesforce’s impressive growth profile, combined with attractive valuations, is attracting long-term investors. CRM has been benefiting from the strong adoption of its cloud-based products and solutions as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation amid the ongoing hybrid work environment. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Per a Grand View Research report, the global CRM software market is projected to witness a CAGR of 13.9% during the 2023-2030 period. With its SaaS-based CRM and social enterprise applications, we believe Salesforce is well-positioned to lead the market.Story continuesAdditionally, the cloud-based customer relationship management software provider’s sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships is helping it enhance its product offerings and expand across newer markets. The buyouts of Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, Mulesoft, Datorama and CloudCraze over the last couple of years have been beneficial for the company.Salesforce's partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Google’s parent Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations. The company also entered into an alliance with Apple through which it is offering new apps for iPhones and iPads.Accelerated digital transformation and a sustained focus on acquisitions and partnerships are driving its revenues. Salesforce’s revenues almost doubled from $13.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2022.The company’s third-quarter fiscal revenues increased 14% year over year to $7.84 billion. Moreover, it targets to achieve annual revenues of $50 billion in fiscal 2026.Attractive Valuation ProfileIn our opinion, shares of Salesforce are currently available at a huge valuation discount, which makes it a lucrative investment option for investors like Elliot and Starboard Value. CRM stock has plunged 32.2% in the trailing 12 months and currently trades at approximately 35.5% lower than the 52-week high of $234.49 attained on Feb 2, 2022.Moreover, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 4.44, significantly lower than the three-year high of 11.27 and the three-year average of 7.65.Technology has been among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off in 2022. However, this sell-off in the broader equity market has led to a massive correction in several technology companies’ stock prices. These companies were considered to be grossly overvalued at the sector’s peak in 2021. With this correction, several tech stocks are currently trading lower than their 52-week high and at an attractive valuation despite strong fundamentals.This has led several private equity and hedge fund investors to buy stakes in fundamentally strong companies, which are available at a huge valuation discount. Apart from Salesforce, Elliot bought a stake in Pinterest PINS, while Starboard Value has a buildup stake in Splunk SPLK and Wix.com WIX.Pinterest’s stock has plunged 32.2% in the trailing 12 months and currently trades at approximately 35.5% lower than the 52-week high of $234.49 attained on Feb 2, 2022. Moreover, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 5.47, significantly lower than the three-year high of 22.46 and the three-year average of 8.49.Splunk has lost 25.3% of its value over the past year and currently trades at approximately 39.9% lower than its 52-week high of $150.79 attained on Apr 4, 2022. Moreover, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 3.72, significantly lower than the three-year high of 13.53 and the three-year average of 7.86.Wix has lost 33.9% of its value in the last 12 months and currently trades at approximately 36.2% lower than its 52-week high of $134.24 attained on Jan 26, 2022. Additionally, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-sales multiple of 3.23, significantly lower than the three-year high of 14.77 and the three-year average of 7.32.Currently, CRM, PINS, SPLK and WIX each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE:MSI) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Motorola Solutions’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Is Motorola Solutions Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Motorola Solutions seems to be fairly priced at around 12.52% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Motorola Solutions today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $226.89, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Motorola Solutions’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Motorola Solutions look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Motorola Solutions' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 63%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MSI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MSI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Motorola Solutions at this point in time.

The company has seen a marked slowdown in revenue and earnings growth which culminated in quarterly earnings declining year-on-year for the quarter that ended September 2022.The consensus estimate for EPS for the quarter ending December is $2.32. This would reflect a decline of 6.5% from the $2.48 reported a year earlier and a small sequential decline from the first quarter. That compares to growth rates that hit 48% in September 2021 and have fallen steadily since.Wall Street is looking for $53.2 bln in revenue, a 3% year-on-year increase, and a record quarterly sales number.EPS estimates for the quarter peaked at $2.77 in May last year, while revenue forecasts peaked at $58 bln around the same time. See our latest analysis for Microsoft Corporation Valuation and Growth TrajectoryWhile the stock price will probably react to an earnings beat or miss in the short term, more important will be the guidance and what it means for the growth trajectory going forward. The chart below reflects EPS estimates to June 2025 from Wall Street analysts. Annualized EPS growth estimates range from 8% to 17%, with an average of about 11.5%.The upper end of that range would probably justify the current valuation - but at the lower end, it would be hard to maintain a 25.7x price multiple. Incidentally, the current stock price is very close to the Simply Wall Street fair value estimate based on current forecasts ($241).In the current environment, it's hard to imagine margins improving very much - so expected revenue growth will be key.Story continuesStaff cutsMicrosoft recently announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees. This represents about 5% of the workforce, so the impact on spending will be quite limited. It’s also worth noting that Microsoft hired 40,000 people in the year to June 2022.ChatGPTMuch has been made of Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and the upcoming integration of ChatGPT with Bing. This is an exciting development but will take time to translate into revenue.It may well allow Bing to attract new users - the challenge then will be to offer users a ChatGPT-like experience that can still be monetized.Nevertheless, any discussion of AI will be an interesting part of the earnings call and will add to the long-term growth narrative.The Bottom LineMicrosoft and Apple ( Nasdaq: AAPL ) were the two tech stocks that initially held up relatively well in 2022, and they are still viewed as relatively defensive within the sector.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETA Weekend Bitcoin Spurt Past $23KBy James RubinBitcoin continued its recent buoyancy over the weekend, rising over $23,000 at one point – BTC's first time above the threshold since early August – before retreating late Sunday.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading above $22,750, roughly flat for the last 24 hours but up more than 8% during the past week. Bitcoin has risen roughly 37% this year as investors dismiss various crypto industry headwinds, most recently Genesis Global Holdco LLC filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although in an email to CoinDesk Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, said the rise was typical for first quarters and noted ""a long consolidation period that saw shorts accumulating.""""The market has risen, partially fueled the short squeeze,"" DiPasquale wrote, adding that ""bitcoin and several altcoins are overheated and due for a correction. ""We wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin testing $20,000 in the coming days.""""For the week ahead, market participants should be mindful of downside risks and potentially seek to take profits.""Ether followed a similar weekend path and was recently changing hands near $1,640, up about 1% from Saturday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value is up approximately 4.5% for the past week and 35% since Dec. 31.Story continuesMost other major cryptos assumed a light green hue, although AXS, the token of the Axie Infinity gaming platform, and YGG, the native crypto of play-to-earn gaming guild Yield Guild Games, were up more than 38% and 18%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of leading cryptos' market performance, was up slightly.Cryptos' weekend rise followed a positive Friday for equity indexes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, which has a strong technology component, jumped 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Traditional asset markets have looked optimistically at mounting evidence that inflation is waning without casting the economy into a steep recession, and are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be ratcheting back its next interest rate hike to 25 basis points (bps) from its more recent diet of 75 and 50 bps increases.Meanwhile, Signature Bank will not handle crypto transactions larger than $100,000, according to a Bloomberg report that cited a statement from exchange giant Binance. In a statement to Bloomberg, Binance said that Signature, which has been looking to reduce its exposure to crypto markets, would ""no longer support any crypto exchange customers with buying and well amounts less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023."" Binance said that this would be ""the case for all Signature's crypto exchange clients"" and noted that some users might ""not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD"" is smaller amounts.In recent weeks, Signature, which has ranked among the most crypto-friendly banks, and other financial services firms have been reducing their exposure to crypto, part of the widening fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion. In December, Signature's CEO said the bank would shrink its deposits tied to cryptocurrencies by $8 billion to $10 billion.Nearly a quarter of the New York-based bank’s $103 billion in total deposits, or roughly 23.5%, came from the crypto industry as of September 2022. But given the recent “issues” in the space, Signature will reduce that amount to under 20% and potentially under 15% eventually, Signature's Joe DePaolo said at an investor conference hosted by investment bank Goldman Sachs.Despite his cautious outlook for the week, BitBull's DiPasquale was more sanguine about the crypto ""market's appetite for risk.""""This is a positive sign for an eventual recovery, but we believe that may need more time and could materialize by end of the year,"" he wrote.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA+8.6%EntertainmentLoopringLRC+5.9%Smart Contract PlatformDogecoinDOGE+5.4%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL−1.8%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC−0.1%CurrencyInsightsMicrosoft Exits the Mixed Reality Space – at Least for NowBy Sam ReynoldsBig tech is making massive cuts to its headcount, and Microsoft is no exception. While layoffs were to be expected at the computing giant as it follows the rest of its peers, they have impacted a specific segment of the company, which might impact exactly what the future idea of the metaverse looks like.As Windows Central reports, Microsoft has laid off its entire mixed reality team, which was behind its virtual reality, augmented reality and HoloLens – its enterprise-focused augmented reality headset – efforts. This includes AltSpace VR, Microsoft’s social VR platform which competes with Horizon Worlds.Microsoft called its augmented and virtual reality efforts ""mixed reality,"" and given the company’s size and scale, it probably had the best shot of making this a new computing paradigm. Microsoft Teams, used widely for collaboration, was fully integrated into the HoloLens as of December.But the metaverse proved to be a struggle for Microsoft.While Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) has gone for the retail side of virtual reality and the metaverse, Microsoft has gone for enterprise users. The premiere enterprise client for the HoloLens was supposed to be the U.S. Army, but Congress isn’t so hot on the idea because test results have been mixed, which has led to limited funding. The head of HoloLens at Microsoft left around the middle of the year. If you’re bullish on the idea that the metaverse includes some sort of headset for virtualized reality, this isn’t very good for that thesis.The struggle to catch onVR/AR is far from new, but found new energy when venture capitalists invented the term ""metaverse"" (to be sure, the metaverse doesn’t necessarily need to include VR or AR).In the gaming world, VR has struggled to evolve past its status as a niche product. Headset sales have been growing since their widespread introduction in 2016, but this growth has slowed. In late December, consultancy IDC published a new forecast for AR/VR headsets that shows slowing growth for the medium.Enterprise should have been where VR/AR – and thus the metaverse – succeeded. But this doesn’t really seem to have caught on either. Microsoft chose to axe these teams when it needed to reduce spending because executives, privy to nonpublic numbers and discussions with potential customers, apparently didn’t see the value the medium.The unmentioned issue here is Apple’s presence. Apple has the potential ability to make a market for a product that others have tried to do and struggled. Remember, the iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone. Palm, Microsoft and Nokia had internet-connected PDAs and phones out before Apple entered the arena. But all of these were largely forgettable compared to the iPhone.Apple still plans to enter the metaverse in 2024-2025 with a mixed-reality headset, according to a report from Bloomberg. Its original plan of building AR glasses has been postponed due to technical challenges, but the company is still committed.By the time Apple enters the market, perhaps in 2025, VR/AR would have been around for a decade. Any other medium with such limited performance would be labeled a niche and the market would move on, not giving it much attention. The question is, can Apple change this where the likes of Microsoft and HTC have struggled?The idea of the metaverse with a headset displaying a virtualized form of reality is counting on this.Important events9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Chicago Fed National Activity Index (Dec)11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) European Commission Consumer Confidence (Jan) 6:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(22:00 UTC) Australia S&amp;P Global Servies PMI (Jan)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Genesis' Crypto Lending Businesses File for Bankruptcy, Winklevoss Threatens Legal Action Against DCGBitcoin (BTC) held around $21,000 as Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of troubled cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Archer-Daniels-Midland with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Fast Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Archer-Daniels-Midland's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 52%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Archer-Daniels-Midland maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 23% to US$99b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Archer-Daniels-Midland's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Archer-Daniels-Midland Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Archer-Daniels-Midland has a market capitalisation of US$47b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$232m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does Archer-Daniels-Midland Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company.

""It's not going to zero because we will continue to invest in and alongside funds, as opposed to individual deals on the balance sheet.""The move is an extension of a strategy laid out in 2020, as the bank aims to reduce its on-balance sheet investments and boost earnings from fees.Goldman had a dismal fourth quarter, missing Wall Street profit targets by a wide margin. Like other banks struggling as company dealmaking stalls, Goldman is letting go of more than 3,000 employees in its biggest round of job cuts since the 2008 financial crisis.The bank will provide further details on its asset plan during Goldman Sachs' investor day on Feb. 28, he said. Alternative assets can include private equity or real estate as opposed to traditional investments such as stocks and bonds.Goldman oversaw a record $2.55 trillion in assets at the end of last year.""As we raise more third-party capital, that (balance sheet investment) becomes a smaller percentage of a growing pie,"" Salisbury said.EARNINGS VOLATILITYSlimming down the investments on a bank's balance sheet can reduce volatility in its earnings, said Mark Narron, senior director of North American banks at credit rating agency Fitch Ratings. Shedding investments also cuts the amount of so-called risk-weighted assets that are used by regulators to determine the amount of capital a bank must hold, he said.Story continuesGoldman Sachs' asset and wealth management posted a 39% decline in net revenue to $13.4 billion in 2022, with its revenue from equity and debt investments sinking 93% and 63%, respectively, according to its earnings announced last week.The $59 billion of alternative investments held on the balance sheet fell from $68 billion a year earlier, the results showed. The positions included $15 billion in equity investments, $19 billion in loans and $12 billion in debt securities, alongside other investments.""Obviously, the environment for exiting assets was much slower in the back half of the year, which meant we were able to realize less gains on the portfolio compared to 2021,"" Salisbury said.If the environment improves for asset sales, Salisbury said he expected to see ""a faster decline in the legacy balance sheet investments.""""If we would have a couple of normalized years, you'd see the reduction happening,"" in that period, he said.PRIVATE CREDITClients are showing keen interest in private credit given sluggish capital markets, Salisbury said.""Private credit is interesting to people because the returns available are attractive,"" he said. ""Investors like the idea of owning something a little more defensive but high yielding in the current economic environment.""Goldman Sachs' asset management arm closed a $15.2 billion fund earlier this month to make junior debt investments in private equity-backed businesses.Private credit assets across the industry have more than doubled to over $1 trillion since 2015, according to data provider Preqin.Investors are also showing interest in private equity funds and are looking to buy positions in the secondary market when existing investors sell their stakes, Salisbury said.The U.S. investment-grade primary bond market kicked off 2023 with a flurry of new deals.The market rally has ""more legs"" because investors are willing to buy bonds with longer maturities while seeking higher credit quality because of the uncertain economic environment, he said.Goldman Sachs economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 25 basis points each in February, March and May, then holding steady for the rest of the year, Salisbury said.More broadly, the ""chilling effect"" of last year's rate hikes is starting to cool economic activity, Salisbury said, citing softer hiring activity and slowing growth in rents.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Megan Davies, Lananh Nguyen and Lisa Shumaker)]"

And here is your full weekly roundup of the biggest news out of hedge funds and company top brass, all first covered on InvestingPro.Shakeup at NetflixNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced that Reed Hastings stepped down as a co-CEO to take on the role of executive chairman. Greg Peters has stepped up from COO to become Ted Sarandos' co-CEO and a member of the Netflix board.Netflix shares surged more than 8% on Friday as the company's global streaming paid net additions grew 7.66 million in Q4, well ahead of its 4.5M estimate, due to both strong acquisition and retention, driven primarily by the success of its Q4 content slate.This caused several Wall Street firms, including Evercore ISI and JPMorgan, to raise their price targets on the stock. JPMorgan raised its target from $330 to $390 maintaining its Overweight rating and Evercore ISI raised its target from $340 to $400 maintaining its Outperform rating. Both firms mentioned the potential for accelerating revenue. Shares climbed 3.8% for the week.A trio of big management changesTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) announced on Thursday that its board of directors appointed current COO Haviv Ilan the company's next CEO, effective April 1. Ilan, who spent 24 years at the company, succeeds current CEO Rich Templeton, who will transition out of these roles over the next two months but will stay on as chairman. Shares slipped 2.3% for the week.Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) announced on Tuesday the appointment of Leslie Berland, Twitter's former top marketer, as Peloton's CMO, effective last Wednesday. This comes amid a parade of new executive appointments at Peloton and attempts to cut costs amid the post-COVID return to gyms, which have undermined consumers' demand for its home-exercise equipment and put the company in the red. Shares rose 1.6% for the week.Story continuesKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) announced on Wednesday that its CEO Steve Kean will step down from his leadership position effective August 1. Kean, who served as CEO since 2015, will be succeeded by President Kim Dang.The company's shares rose more than 2% on Wednesday after the company reported a Q4 revenue miss. The company also announced a $1 billion increase in its share repurchase program.Ryan Cohen's big Alibaba betTurning to hedge funds, activist investor Ryan Cohen has accumulated a stake in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in the second half of 2022, according to the report by Wall Street Journal. Cohen, whose stake is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, believes the company could reach double-digit sales growth and nearly 20% free cash flow growth over the coming five years.While Alibaba raised the size of its share repurchase program to $40B in November, Cohen suggested the company raise it to $60B, according to people familiar with the matter. Shares were up 4.5% for the week.Rounding up the week's big hedge fund newsTenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) said David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital took a medium-sized long position in the company during Q4.And hedge fund ValueAct Capital called on Seven &amp; i (OTC:SVNDY) shareholders on Thursday to back a spin-off of the company's 7-Eleven convenience store chain, arguing that the move would deliver considerable benefits to shareholders. ValueAct Capital, which owns a 4.4% stake in the Japanese company, and has been pushing for changes for over a year, argued that a spin-off could be completed via a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange within a year.Seven &amp; i is currently conducting a strategic review and has pledged to announce its decisions by early March.

However, the stock is still off roughly 50% from its record high of $690 a share reached in November 2021.And as analysts and investors turn bullish amid new profitability initiatives like a crackdown on password sharing and a recently launched ad-supported tier, one industry watcher is warning there's still much more the company needs to prove to investors.""We think it's too early to buy NFLX,"" Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a new client note on Friday.The analyst listed several concerns for the company in 2023, including elevated churn over the next two quarters amid its password sharing crackdown, in addition to more consumers trading down to the cheaper, ad-supported plan due to the price increases.Martin stressed minimizing churn will be paramount for all streaming companies in 2023, and represents the biggest risk for Netflix. Especially as its daily engagement rate of roughly 2 hours per day lags competitors like Roku (ROKU), which boasts an average engagement rate of 4 hours per day.Netflix acknowledged increased churn levels while testing the password-sharing crackdown in Latin America, but noted engagement steadily increased over time as borrowers signed up for their own accounts and new content was released.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Martin also called out Netflix's admission that advertising revenue won't be meaningful in 2023. Instead, the company described the initiative as a long-term effort.""It's a multi-year path,"" CFO Spencer Neumann told investors on the earnings call, going so far as to say Netflix's ad business could eventually be larger than Hulu's.""We're not going to be larger than Hulu in year one, but, hopefully, over the next several years, we can be at least as large,"" he said. Neumann added the goal is for Netflix is for advertising to be, ""bigger than at least 10% of our revenue and hopefully much more over time.""Story continuesStill, Martin argued that's not enough to justify buying shares at current levels, stating bluntly: ""We believe current 2023 estimates and valuations are too high for NFLX.""""From a valuation point of view, we worry that NFLX's multiple is too high as its growth principally relies on price increases,"" the analyst said. ""That is, sub ads have been decelerating every quarter for the past 6 quarters, reaching 4% year-over-year growth in 4Q22.""""Therefore, to reach double-digit revenue growth from now on, the company must raise prices by 6% to 8% per year, depending on [foreign exchange], even in recession years,"" Martin added, cautioning a long and bump road is likely ahead for the streaming powerhouse.Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends a screening for the documentary ""The Redeem Team"" in Los Angeles, California, U.S. September 22, 2022.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Newmont, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Newmont ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Newmont?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Newmont. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Newmont's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Newmont. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NewmontWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Newmont Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$42m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Newmont. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Newmont (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

60,309db085-2e6d-3dd9-9c11-1a1ce819873e,NEM,2023-01-23,13 Biggest Gold Mines in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-biggest-gold-mines-world-213301475.html,1674423181,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'GOLD', 'AEM', 'NEM']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 biggest gold mines in the world. You can skip this part and go to 5 Biggest Gold Mines in the World.Investors almost always remain focused on the movement of gold, perhaps the most valuable and reliable asset in the world. Gold price touched new records last year as investors flocked to the safe-haven asset amid recession fears. Recently, gold price touched its peak of about $1,850 per troy ounce. Analysts believe gold price is expected to soar in 2023 as the Fed doesn’t show any signs of halting rate hikes. There are already some predictions about gold price possibly touching its all-time high in 2023.According to a CNBC report, Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF (FRA:ZSG0.F), thinks we will see a new all-time high for gold as the analyst expects the start of a  “new secular bull market.” He thinks the price of gold could touch $2,100 per ounce.“Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022,” Strand said, according to CNBC.But there is another prediction that’d make the above price target for gold look cheap. Danish investment firm Saxo Bank recently said in a report that gold price could touch $3000 per ounce in 2023. This is because the bank believes 2023 would become a “war economy” and everyone would flock to gold. Saxo Bank believes there will be a big political crisis in Europe and expects French President Macron's resignation as it thinks the French population is unhappy due to inflation and rising energy prices and the opponents of Macron are getting stronger. Saxo Bank also believes the UK would rejoin the EU and the EU will take an initiative to develop its own unionized army.However, some believe that gold prices are expected to remain flat in the coming year because 2022 has shown that the illiquid nature of gold provides no safety net for its buyers. For example when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, the U.S. government bonds get a boost. On the other hand, gold does not pay anything. When the US dollar gets stronger, gold becomes expensive for foreign buyers.Story continuesAccording to WSJ, Kathy Kriskey, commodity strategist at Invesco, believes gold is not a good inflation hedge.“Oh, inflation? I got to use gold. No, gold is not a good inflation hedge,” Kriskey reportedly said.There are many reasons to invest in gold stocks. One, major gold companies are stable and unlike tech growth stocks, they tend to show stability during tough times. Second, major gold companies pay strong dividends. For example, major gold mining companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), and Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) have been rewarding their investors with regular dividends for the past several years.As of January 8, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) has a dividend yield of over 4%, while Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) has a 2.8% dividend yield. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) in May last year announced a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.Recent signs of easing inflation have spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in smaller increments in 2023. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have rebounded from their 2022 lows, while bond prices, which rise when yields fall, have jumped.Hedge funds and other speculative investors have lately piled into gold after pulling out for most of 2022, pushing bullish wagers on the metal during the week ended Dec. 13 to the highest level since June, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data tracking futures and options.Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) analysts say gold could top $2,000 an ounce in 2023, which would be near record levels. Elevated risks of a global recession could boost inflows into gold funds, Citigroup analysts wrote.Estimates from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources of the Government of Australia (DISER) said that the global gold production was expected to jump 2.2% to 3,660 tonnes in 2022. Production in China, Australia and Africa were expected to drive this growth.The estimates also said that gold production in China was expected to gain in 2022 as the country reopened gold production in the Shandong province. Gold prices already saw a boost at the start of 2023 after China began to lift COVID restrictions. China is the biggest commodities market in the world, and Chinese consumers account for a major portion of actual gold sales.Photo by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we consulted research reports produced by mining industry analysts, used company screeners and did manual research to devise a vast list of major gold mines operating in the world. We then found 2021 gold production data for these mines and picked the top 13 of these mines based on gold production.The list is ranked in an ascending order of gold production. We have also mentioned the notable companies that are operating these mines.Biggest Gold Mines in the World13. Pueblo Viejo Total production in 2021: 488,000 OuncesThe Pueblo Viejo mine is located in Dominican Republic. It is the biggest gold mine in Latin America.

61,ad6a189f-5ceb-3de9-b581-4f9675366c9c,NEM,2023-01-23,The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-dividend-stocks-buy-181735051.html,1674152255,STORY,"['CVX', 'PFE', 'LMT', 'COST', 'T-PC', 'RIO', 'NEM']","[In any market condition, it’s important to hold dividend stocks in one’s portfolio. These stocks provide regular cash inflow and, if valuations are attractive, meaningful capital gains. With market conditions remaining relatively bearish, some of the best dividend stocks trade at attractive valuations. These stocks can potentially deliver robust total returns.I also want to point out that the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) has delivered annualized returns of 11.6% in the last 10 years. During the same period, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) has delivered annualized returns of 12.8%.It therefore makes sense to hold low-beta dividend stocks in the portfolio. This is particularly true at a time when macroeconomic headwinds are significant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI also believe that the discussed dividend stocks are likely to outperform the index returns in 2023. Let’s talk about the reasons for considering these best dividend stocks.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has been trending higher as inflation data indicates that this might be the end of aggressive contractionary policies. With the possibility of a recession in 2023, gold is an attractive investment theme.Among gold miners, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is worth considering at current levels. The 4.19% dividend yield has the potential to deliver capital gains besides visibility for dividend growth.An investment-grade balance sheet and robust cash flows are key reasons to like Newmont. Additionally, the company has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of proved reserves. This provides stable production visibility.High financial flexibility is also likely to ensure that the reserve replacement is close to 100%. Additionally, Newmont expects its all-in-sustaining cost to decline in the next few years. As gold trends higher, there is significant room for EBITDA margin expansion.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is also among the best dividend stocks to buy. The stock, which sports a 2.68% dividend yield, trades at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.6. I expect the stock to remain in an uptrend besides the benefit of quarterly cash dividends.Defense-sector spending will likely remain high in the coming years. Lockheed Martin is positioned to benefit as contracts increase from the U.S. and European countries. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $140 billion.This provides clear cash-flow visibility. For the first nine months of 2022, the company reported free cash flow (FCF) of $4.9 billion. With the order intake remaining robust, LMT stock is also among the top dividend growth stocks.When it comes to long-term growth, Lockheed Martin is investing in new technology. This includes hypersonics, directed energy and autonomy. Investment in innovation will ensure that Lockheed remains among the top defense players.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo on wooden backgroundSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is attractive for two reasons. First, the stock offers a dividend yield of 5.74% that seems sustainable. Further, T stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 7.5. A meaningful rally is likely from undervalued levels.The media division spinoff has allowed AT&amp;T to focus on its core business. Importantly, the company has reduced net debt by $25 billion year to date through Q3 2022. With the company expecting $14 billion in free cash flow for the year, deleveraging will continue.The business metrics also look encouraging for AT&amp;T. The company continues to add 5G wireless and fiber subscribers. Increased 5G penetration is likely to translate into higher average revenue per user. For Q3 2022, AT&amp;T reported the best revenue growth in wireless services in more than a decade.I must also mention that the company reported capital expenditure of $5.9 billion for Q3 2022. With an annual investment visibility of $20 billion, revenue growth is likely to be supported in the coming years.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a correction mode, and the key reason is lower revenue visibility from the Covid-19 vaccine. However, at a forward P/E ratio of 9.8, the stock seems seriously undervalued. PFE stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.56%.If we look beyond near-term concerns, there are several reasons to like Pfizer. The company has a product pipeline of 112 drugs, and as these candidates are commercialized, revenue growth is likely.Further, Pfizer has boosted its financial flexibility with significant free cash flows from vaccine sales. This cash is being deployed to accelerate the product pipeline.At the same time, Pfizer has been active on the inorganic growth front. The company is targeting $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue from new business deals by 2030.Recently, Pfizer announced that it will sell its full portfolio of drugs to low-income countries at no profit. The company establishing a presence in these markets could be potentially rewarding in the long term.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comAmong industrial commodity dividend stocks, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is worth buying. The 8.95% dividend yield stock has trended higher by 35% in the last six months. However, the stock still trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 11.39.Rio Tinto reported free cash flow of $7.1 billion for the first half of 2022. With an annualized FCF potential of $14 billion, the business is a cash-flow machine. This has translated into a quality balance sheet that ensures sustained dividends.It’s worth noting that Rio has guided for annual capital expenditure of $9.5 billion for 2023 and 2024. This excludes any potential mergers and acquisitions. With Rio focused on base metals like copper and lithium, the outlook is positive. These metals will remain in demand with a continued push toward green energy. As an example, Rio is already positioned to be the largest supplier of lithium in Europe in the next 15 years.Chevron Corporation (CVX)a Chevron gas stationSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is possibly among the best dividend stocks for the long term. Chevron was among the few companies that managed to generate positive operating cash flows (OCFs) when oil plunged in 2021. With low breakeven assets, the company is positioned to deliver robust cash flows.Just to put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. On an annual basis, the OCF potential is in excess of $40 billion. The company has ambitious plans to invest $15 billion to $17 billion annually in the next few years.Even after these investments, there is ample cash flow for dividend growth and share repurchases. Furthermore, Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Strong financial flexibility allows Chevron to make significant investments in the lower carbon business.Chevron also has a strong asset base, and the reserve replacement has been healthy. This ensures long-term cash-flow visibility and shareholder value creation.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comRetail stocks have been depressed in 2022, with inflation playing the spoilsport. However, amid the challenges, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has traded sideways in the last 12 months. A dividend yield of 0.75% might not sound attractive. However, I expect COST stock to trend higher, and there is dividend growth visibility.For the first quarter of 2023, Costco reported revenue growth of 8.1% to $53.44 billion. The key point to note is that the U.S. is staring at a potential recession. With retail spending being a key growth driver, policies are likely to be directed toward boosting spending. This will benefit Costco.It’s worth noting that Costco has 66.9 million household members. This translates into $4.3 billion in annualized membership fees. With continued expansion and high renewal rates, I expect the recurring revenue to swell. This will have a positive impact on free cash flows.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the European military dynamics and go directly to 10 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power.The countries in Europe are aggressively increasing their arms procurement and military readiness in the wake of the Ukraine war. Apart from being militarily ready, the build-up is also meant to aid Ukraine in its resistance against Russia. In this regard, Germany is exceptionally important, since its military industry plays a crucial role in European defense. On January 20, western nations agreed to ramp up their military support for Ukraine. However, Germany has so far paused its delivery of indigenously-made Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. According to the newly appointed German defense minister Boris Postrius, the decision is motivated out of a need for “risk assessment” of such a move.  This, however, did not prevent other European countries like Poland, Finland and Baltic countries from moving ahead with plans to deliver their own Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. Despite German hesitance on Leopard-2 deliveries, the country is set to deliver indigenously made Marder infantry vehicles and Cheetah anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine due to an agreement signed with the US in December, 2022.Europe's Military Preparation: NumbersAccording to the European Defense Agency, European military spending stood at $231 billion in 2021, a 6% increase from the previous year. It was the seventh year of back to back growth in military spending on the continent. The spending was at a historic low in 2014, at 1.3% of EU’s GDP. However, the Russian takeover of Crimea in the same year, followed by the Trump administration’s insistence on an increase in military contributions by other NATO members, led to a consistent increase in spending observed in the following years, aggregating at a 32% in real terms in 2021. In June, 2022, the German lower house parliament approved a defense fund of over $100 billion that was announced in February of last year in response to the Ukrainian invasion. The fund is aimed at topping-up Germany’s regular defense budget over the course of next few years to help rebuild its military.Story continuesThe fund should enable it to meet NATO’s 2% defense-spending target, which would make Germany the third biggest military spender behind the US and China. In that respect, the increase in military spending in Europe is likely to continue and may even accelerate. Current projections put forward by EDA show a growth of $76 billion in defense expenditures by 2025.How the Defense Sector Will Benefit?The increasing spending is boosting European arms manufacturers’ balance sheets. Companies like Dassault Aviation,  Hensoldt AG and Rheinmetall AG have greatly benefited. The announcement of the German defense fund that we have discussed above, led to 89% and 49% in trading gains for the German radar and sensor company Hensoldt AG and armor-vehicle manufacturer Rheinmetall AG respectively, in February. The French aircraft manufacturer, Dassault Aviation SE also saw gains of 11%.As of 2022, Rheinmetall AG was reported to be increasing the production of tanks from 40,000 units per year to 240,000 units per year. In the same year, contracts for the Eurodrone project, which is expected to reduce Europe’s reliance on Israeli drones, were signed by Germany, France, Spain and Italy. These contracts were awarded to Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA) by OCCAR. Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA), on the other hand, has chosen  Avivo Aero, owned by the US-based General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), for the design and production of the drone’s engine. Apart from the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), other US defense corporations like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are also enhancing European defense capabilities. Its stealth aircraft - F-35 Lightning-II, is included in several European countries’ air force inventories.In a bid to aggressively revamp its military, Germany has announced further procurement of 35 F35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a $14 billion deal, the first eight of which will be delivered to the country in 2026.  As the west continues to rearm itself and bolster Ukrainian military support, the defense sector is expected to be an outperformer in the years to come.Let’s now move on to the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power. 25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military PowerPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe’ve defined militarily strong European countries as ones that have advanced strategic military assets, geographical advantages, and logistical and financial capability. The last metric is important since financial capacity is a direct determinant of military capability.For this purpose, we have first identified the top 25 European countries in the Global Firepower Index of 2023 and ranked them as such, then we have used the GDPs of these countries to rank them separately. Then we've averaged out the rankings for our list. For countries with the same averaged-out ranking, we’ve used their ranking in Global Firepower Index as a tiebreaker. At discretion, we’ve discussed the size of some of the countries’ military assets, especially naval and air fleets since they are the primary components of military power. For militarily important countries, we’ve also discussed their cyberwarfare capabilities, number of military bases around the world and space capabilities for military purposes. For this, we’ve sourced data from The Power Atlas by the European Council on Foreign Relations. For some countries, we have also discussed military spending, and have obtained the data from the World Bank. Here are the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power.25.

(PRNewsFoto/Florida Power &amp; Light Company)The plan, which must be approved by the PSC, seeks to balance unrecovered fuel and storm costs from 2022 and a recent decline in projected 2023 fuel costs to minimize the impact on customer bills.FPL Proposal for Fuel and Storm CostsEffective April 2023ItemDescriptionDuration on BillBill Impact2022 Fuel Under-recovery2022 natural gas prices higherthan projected 21 monthsExpectedIncrease2022 Storm CostsIncremental restoration costs fromHurricanes Ian and Nicole12 monthsExpectedIncrease2023 Fuel Over-recovery2023 natural gas prices expected to be lower than initial forecast9 monthsExpected Decrease""FPL has a proven track record of keeping bills below the national average. When events beyond our control – like hurricanes and significant changes in fuel prices – force a change to customer bills, we try to do so in a thoughtful way that minimizes the impact on our customers while balancing the risk of invoices piling up,"" said FPL Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy. ""Still, we recognize that every dollar matters, which is why we encourage customers to use FPL's free tools and simple tips to save energy and money on their electric bills.""If the proposal is approved, FPL's typical 1,000-kWh residential bill for customers in peninsular Florida would increase in April by approximately 10%, as compared to rates that were approved to take effect in February. Even under the proposed plan, FPL's typical residential bill in peninsular Florida is expected to remain well below the national average and remain the lowest among Florida's investor-owned utilities, which collectively serve more than 75% of the state's population. FPL's typical, 1,000-kWh residential bill for customers in Northwest Florida would increase roughly 8% in April as compared to rates effective in February but remain below the national average.Story continuesFPL typical 1,000-kWh residential customer billFPLFPL NorthwestApril 2023(proposed)% Increase*April 2023(proposed)% Increase*$142.88~10%$173.09~8%*As compared to rates effective beginning Feb. 1, 2023  Rapid responses to restore power after Ian and rare November hurricaneUnder PSC rules, FPL and other utilities are responsible for restoring power and paying bills upfront after a hurricane strikes. Utilities then recover their restoration costs through a surcharge on customer bills, subject to PSC review and approval of expenses incurred. In this case, FPL is seeking recovery of $1.3 billion for incremental restoration costs from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As part of FPL's plan, customers would pay a temporary storm surcharge for 12 months, beginning in April. Recovering these costs over one year rather than a longer time period reduces the risk of storm costs piling up on customer bills if there are additional hurricanes or severe weather events in 2023.FPL's investments in hardening the energy grid since the destructive 2004-05 hurricane seasons helped speed restoration times and likely reduced total restoration costs for Ian and Nicole. After Hurricane Irma in 2017, FPL calculated that restoration would have taken four days longer and cost $496 million more if the energy grid had not been hardened. FPL's continued investments in storm hardening led to a rapid response to Ian – earning national honors this month, the 13th time FPL's emergency response has been recognized by industry peers.As part of today's filing, FPL also responded to the PSC's request to calculate the impact of spreading the remaining costs from past hurricanes that affected customers of the former Gulf Power across all FPL customer bills. Doing so would reduce the monthly storm charge on a typical 1,000-kWh bill in Northwest Florida by nearly $10.Volatility in price of natural gas FPL is also seeking permission to recover about $2.1 billion to make up for the difference between projections and actual costs for natural gas in 2022. FPL's proposal would spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April 2023 to reduce the impact on customer bills. Partially offsetting these higher fuel costs, FPL plans to decrease its projected 2023 fuel factor by about $1 billion during the final nine months of this year due to a sharp drop in projected natural gas prices after 2023 projections were filed with the PSC in the third quarter of 2022.Even with the volatility in the natural gas market and sharp increases experienced in 2022, natural gas remains far more cost-effective than fuel oil and coal to generate electricity. FPL's decision in the early 2000s to seek energy independence and modernize its generating fleet by moving away from foreign oil and constructing ultra fuel-efficient clean energy centers and leading America's largest solar expansion has saved customers more than $14 billion while dramatically reducing carbon emissions. In fact, FPL's 50 solar power plants – the largest fleet in America – don't use fuel at all to generate electricity, avoiding about $375 million in fuel costs in 2022 alone. FPL will add 16 more solar plants in 2023 as part of plans to install 90,000 megawatts of solar energy in Florida and massively expand battery storage over the next two decades.FPL offers energy-saving tips to customersWith the bill increase proposed to take effect in April 2023, FPL is encouraging customers to take steps now to lower their bills by reducing energy use and making their homes more energy efficient. For example:Depending on the season, customers should cool their home at 78°or warmer or heat their home at 68° or cooler. Each degree customers lower or increase the temperature on their thermostat can reduce their bill by 5% a month for heating or cooling costs.Customers can clean the lint filter in their dryer before each load to minimize drying time.Turn off ceiling fans and lights in unoccupied rooms.View daily, weekly and monthly energy use by using the FPL Mobile App, which is available on the Apple App store, Google Play or by texting ""App"" to MyFPL (69375).Customers can activate the free FPL Energy Manager tool to monitor how their home is using energy and identify ways to save.For more helpful tips, customers can visit FPL.com/waystosave.Florida Power &amp; Light Company   As America's largest electric utility, Florida Power &amp; Light Company serves more customers and sells more power than any other utility, providing clean, affordable, reliable electricity to approximately 5.8 million accounts, or more than 12 million people.

Shares were up 1.3%.""While production was inline, sales were impacted, leading to weaker-than-expected cash generation,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock of Barrenjoey in Sydney.Delayed shipments of inventories - mostly aluminium - tied up an extra $100 million of working capital in the December half year.""This impact is most acute in our aluminium value chain in Southern Africa due to ongoing shipping delays.""South32 logged a 24.4% rise in its second-quarter metallurgical coal output, helped by improved volumes and labour productivity at its Appin mine in Australia's New South Wales state, following worker strikes and an extended longwall move.In October, South32 finalised a new enterprise agreement at the mine with a term of four years to 2026 to deal with continued workers strike over pay hikes.For the second quarter, it posted metallurgical coal production of 1.5 million tonnes (Mt), up from 1.2 Mt produced a year earlier and in-line with a consensus estimate of 1.5 Mt, according to Goldman Sachs.South32, however, trimmed its full year production forecast for its aluminium operations in Brazil by 25% as the smelter's ramp-up to nameplate capacity was delayed to the September quarter.It also cut guidance at its Cannington silver-zinc mine by 11% partly due to lower availability of labour.South32 experienced two fatalities at its Mozal Aluminium operation in November after an incident occurred during maintenance work.In manganese ore, South32 reported 1,477 kilotonnes (kt) of production, ahead of an RBC estimate by 7%. It produced 18.9kt of copper, slightly ahead of RBC's 18kt estimate.The Perth-based miner added that despite inflationary pressures, it expects to report operating unit costs for the first half of fiscal 2023 inline or below its current forecast at the majority of its operations.(Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne and Himanshi Akhand and Rishav Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Shumaker)]"

(NASDAQ:EXPE)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-expedia-101918483.html,1674469158,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Expedia Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Expedia Group Is Expedia Group Still Cheap?Expedia Group is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Expedia Group’s ratio of 38.52x is above its peer average of 18.97x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Hospitality industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Expedia Group’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Expedia Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Expedia Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EXPE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe EXPE should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EXPE for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for EXPE, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Expedia Group as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

88,c10106cf-f7c5-32c0-b891-c9b08ccaa002,EXPE,2023-01-23,The Expedia Case For and Against Keeping Orbitz and Travelocity,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-case-against-keeping-orbitz-070000109.html,1674457200,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Former Expedia Group CEO Dara Khosrowshahi held aloft Travelocity mascot the Roaming Gnome when Expedia Group acquired Travelocity in 2015. Should Expedia Group keep Travelocity? Expedia Inc.A research report found that Expedia Group has lost global hotel market share since the onset of the pandemic, and all of it has come from plunging business at non-core brands, such as Hotwire, eBookers, Orbitz and Travelocity.In contrast, Bernstein research determined that foundational Expedia Group brands Expedia.com and Vrbo are increasing market share, and that “the sub-brands’ losses look to be by design, and have already lost half of their pre-Covid share.”The backdrop to these developments is that the Bernstein report, “Global OTAs: A deep dive into market share – not all is as it seems,” stated that “For the first time in history — Booking and Expedia have lost aggregate share through Covid.”But lumping together Booking Holdings and Expedia Group, if ever the hotel lobby’s “duopoly” designation was ever on point, is somewhat arbitrary. The report noted that Booking actually gained a small slice of marketshare since the pandemic began while Expedia Group, and metasearch, lost ground. Google, Airbnb, Hopper eDreams, Trip.com and direct bookings (Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt) were the beneficiaries, the report stated.One can see from the chart that Booking and Expedia’s combined global hotel market share fell from an estimated 20 percent in the third quarter of 2019 to 19 percent in the third quarter of 2022. But, more significantly, Expedia Group’s share fell 2 percentage points during that period to 4 percent.The Bernstein report focuses on hotel market share, and factors in their respective short-term rental businesses to derive hotel market share numbers. It found that Booking’s hotel business is four times larger than Expedia’s when considering room nights.What Is Expedia Doing With Orbitz, eBookers and Hotwire?The Bernstein report stated that Expedia Group’s sub-brands — namely Hotwire, Orbitz and eBookers — lost half of their market share during the pandemic, and speculated that it may have been on purpose. Other Expedia Group brands, including Hotels.com and Travelocity, saw a 40 percent traffic decline during the pandemic, the report found.Story continuesOne has to wonder whether Expedia Group, which has been restructuring to simplify its operations over the past two years, has been laying the groundwork to dispose of some of these non-core brands in some fashion, either by selling them, or integrating their audiences into Expedia.com and Vrbo.After all, over the last couple of years, Expedia Group, in the name of streamlining operations, sold or disposed of brands, including Egencia, Classic Vacations, SilverRail, Alice, Expedia Group Mulitfamily, and BodyBuilding.com. Expedia scaled back other brands like Local Expert, trimmed its global distribution suppliers, and combined teams companywide to overturn the previous brand by brand operational structure.So wouldn’t it make sense for Expedia Group to gut Orbitz, Travelocity, eBookers, Hotwire and others in favor of more focus on Expedia.com and Vrbo?Expedia’s Strategy Then and NowIn the span of a year starting in late 2014, Expedia Group acquired Wotif, Travelocity, and Orbitz and basically turned them into front-end shells that are today in many ways clones of and powered by Expedia in the back end. Their workforces were eviscerated over the years.The strategy has been to cut all the costs possible from running these brands, and take advantage of their brand recognition and customer bases.While there still is undoubtably a cost to operate and market these brands, and a certain amount of complexity involved, killing the brands — or at least some of them — may be counter-productive because some still have loyal audiences.Travelocity founder Terrell Jones said Expedia group erred in making the Travelocity and Orbitz user interfaces similar to Expedia.com.“We all know that customers shop many, many online sites looking for the best price but obviously if a site looks identical and produces identical results it probably isn’t worth the effort,” Jones said. “They could have normalized the back end and left the UI somewhat different and might have achieved different results.”Similarweb ranked Travelocity the ninth and Orbitz the 15th largest travel and tourism websites in the U.S. by traffic in November, for example. They undoubtably still attract a lot of bookings for Expedia Group.However, Similarweb ranked Expedia’s Hotwire #30 in the U.S. while eBookers, which came as part of the package when Expedia acquired Orbitz Worldwide in 2015, was 218th within the UK travel and tourism website pecking order.Expedia wouldn’t comment on the Bernstein report.However, during Expedia Group’s third quarter earnings call in November, CEO Peter Kern, commenting on market share shifts in lodging in North America, said things were normalizing after the company engaged in “moving” technology platforms and “pulled back on some discounting and some other things where the competition has been very heavy.”Citing market share declines at Orbitz, Hotwire, Wotif and Travelocity, the Bernstein report said Expedia Group may be more than half-way toward stemming its market share losses, adding “and Expedia’s performance may well trend more toward the performance of core brands Expedia and Vrbo.”Report author Richard Clarke of Bernstein said he expects Expedia Group may opt to have sub-brands like Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire and eBookers “keep ticking along” because it would be a waste to lose their customers. They can be retained with zero brand and performance marketing costs as long as Google still shows them love in its free listings, he said.When Expedia Group announced last year that it plans to debut a unified loyalty program across brands in 2023, it cited Expedia.com, Hotels.com, eBookers, Travelocity and Vrbo as being part of that vision.Another research analyst, who declined to be identified, said he doesn’t think Expedia Group would sell these sub-brands, but could merge them into bigger brands like Expedia.com, similar to the way Expedia killed the HomeAway brand in favor of Vrbo a few years ago.Whether Expedia decides or not to further diminish or wipe out its long-tail of brands, it’s clear that the focus is on Expedia.com and Vrbo, and perhaps with a dash of Hotels.com mixed in.Note: This story has been updated to add comments from Travelocity founder Terrell Jones.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the European military dynamics and go directly to 10 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power.The countries in Europe are aggressively increasing their arms procurement and military readiness in the wake of the Ukraine war. Apart from being militarily ready, the build-up is also meant to aid Ukraine in its resistance against Russia. In this regard, Germany is exceptionally important, since its military industry plays a crucial role in European defense. On January 20, western nations agreed to ramp up their military support for Ukraine. However, Germany has so far paused its delivery of indigenously-made Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. According to the newly appointed German defense minister Boris Postrius, the decision is motivated out of a need for “risk assessment” of such a move.  This, however, did not prevent other European countries like Poland, Finland and Baltic countries from moving ahead with plans to deliver their own Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. Despite German hesitance on Leopard-2 deliveries, the country is set to deliver indigenously made Marder infantry vehicles and Cheetah anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine due to an agreement signed with the US in December, 2022.Europe's Military Preparation: NumbersAccording to the European Defense Agency, European military spending stood at $231 billion in 2021, a 6% increase from the previous year. It was the seventh year of back to back growth in military spending on the continent. The spending was at a historic low in 2014, at 1.3% of EU’s GDP. However, the Russian takeover of Crimea in the same year, followed by the Trump administration’s insistence on an increase in military contributions by other NATO members, led to a consistent increase in spending observed in the following years, aggregating at a 32% in real terms in 2021. In June, 2022, the German lower house parliament approved a defense fund of over $100 billion that was announced in February of last year in response to the Ukrainian invasion. The fund is aimed at topping-up Germany’s regular defense budget over the course of next few years to help rebuild its military.Story continuesThe fund should enable it to meet NATO’s 2% defense-spending target, which would make Germany the third biggest military spender behind the US and China. In that respect, the increase in military spending in Europe is likely to continue and may even accelerate. Current projections put forward by EDA show a growth of $76 billion in defense expenditures by 2025.How the Defense Sector Will Benefit?The increasing spending is boosting European arms manufacturers’ balance sheets. Companies like Dassault Aviation,  Hensoldt AG and Rheinmetall AG have greatly benefited. The announcement of the German defense fund that we have discussed above, led to 89% and 49% in trading gains for the German radar and sensor company Hensoldt AG and armor-vehicle manufacturer Rheinmetall AG respectively, in February. The French aircraft manufacturer, Dassault Aviation SE also saw gains of 11%.As of 2022, Rheinmetall AG was reported to be increasing the production of tanks from 40,000 units per year to 240,000 units per year. In the same year, contracts for the Eurodrone project, which is expected to reduce Europe’s reliance on Israeli drones, were signed by Germany, France, Spain and Italy. These contracts were awarded to Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA) by OCCAR. Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA), on the other hand, has chosen  Avivo Aero, owned by the US-based General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), for the design and production of the drone’s engine. Apart from the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), other US defense corporations like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are also enhancing European defense capabilities. Its stealth aircraft - F-35 Lightning-II, is included in several European countries’ air force inventories.In a bid to aggressively revamp its military, Germany has announced further procurement of 35 F35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a $14 billion deal, the first eight of which will be delivered to the country in 2026.  As the west continues to rearm itself and bolster Ukrainian military support, the defense sector is expected to be an outperformer in the years to come.Let’s now move on to the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power. 25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military PowerPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe’ve defined militarily strong European countries as ones that have advanced strategic military assets, geographical advantages, and logistical and financial capability. The last metric is important since financial capacity is a direct determinant of military capability.For this purpose, we have first identified the top 25 European countries in the Global Firepower Index of 2023 and ranked them as such, then we have used the GDPs of these countries to rank them separately. Then we've averaged out the rankings for our list. For countries with the same averaged-out ranking, we’ve used their ranking in Global Firepower Index as a tiebreaker. At discretion, we’ve discussed the size of some of the countries’ military assets, especially naval and air fleets since they are the primary components of military power. For militarily important countries, we’ve also discussed their cyberwarfare capabilities, number of military bases around the world and space capabilities for military purposes. For this, we’ve sourced data from The Power Atlas by the European Council on Foreign Relations. For some countries, we have also discussed military spending, and have obtained the data from the World Bank. Here are the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power.25. BelarusGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 23 GDP Ranking: 24 Average Ranking: 23.5Belarus is a close Russian ally in its war against Ukraine and is one of the strongest countries in Europe in terms of military strength.

90,ad6a189f-5ceb-3de9-b581-4f9675366c9c,LMT,2023-01-23,The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-dividend-stocks-buy-181735051.html,1674152255,STORY,"['CVX', 'PFE', 'LMT', 'COST', 'T-PC', 'RIO', 'NEM']","[In any market condition, it’s important to hold dividend stocks in one’s portfolio. These stocks provide regular cash inflow and, if valuations are attractive, meaningful capital gains. With market conditions remaining relatively bearish, some of the best dividend stocks trade at attractive valuations. These stocks can potentially deliver robust total returns.I also want to point out that the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) has delivered annualized returns of 11.6% in the last 10 years. During the same period, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) has delivered annualized returns of 12.8%.It therefore makes sense to hold low-beta dividend stocks in the portfolio. This is particularly true at a time when macroeconomic headwinds are significant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI also believe that the discussed dividend stocks are likely to outperform the index returns in 2023. Let’s talk about the reasons for considering these best dividend stocks.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has been trending higher as inflation data indicates that this might be the end of aggressive contractionary policies. With the possibility of a recession in 2023, gold is an attractive investment theme.Among gold miners, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is worth considering at current levels. The 4.19% dividend yield has the potential to deliver capital gains besides visibility for dividend growth.An investment-grade balance sheet and robust cash flows are key reasons to like Newmont. Additionally, the company has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of proved reserves. This provides stable production visibility.High financial flexibility is also likely to ensure that the reserve replacement is close to 100%. Additionally, Newmont expects its all-in-sustaining cost to decline in the next few years. As gold trends higher, there is significant room for EBITDA margin expansion.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is also among the best dividend stocks to buy. The stock, which sports a 2.68% dividend yield, trades at an attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.6. I expect the stock to remain in an uptrend besides the benefit of quarterly cash dividends.Defense-sector spending will likely remain high in the coming years. Lockheed Martin is positioned to benefit as contracts increase from the U.S. and European countries. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $140 billion.This provides clear cash-flow visibility. For the first nine months of 2022, the company reported free cash flow (FCF) of $4.9 billion. With the order intake remaining robust, LMT stock is also among the top dividend growth stocks.When it comes to long-term growth, Lockheed Martin is investing in new technology. This includes hypersonics, directed energy and autonomy. Investment in innovation will ensure that Lockheed remains among the top defense players.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo on wooden backgroundSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is attractive for two reasons. First, the stock offers a dividend yield of 5.74% that seems sustainable. Further, T stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 7.5. A meaningful rally is likely from undervalued levels.The media division spinoff has allowed AT&amp;T to focus on its core business. Importantly, the company has reduced net debt by $25 billion year to date through Q3 2022. With the company expecting $14 billion in free cash flow for the year, deleveraging will continue.The business metrics also look encouraging for AT&amp;T. The company continues to add 5G wireless and fiber subscribers. Increased 5G penetration is likely to translate into higher average revenue per user. For Q3 2022, AT&amp;T reported the best revenue growth in wireless services in more than a decade.I must also mention that the company reported capital expenditure of $5.9 billion for Q3 2022. With an annual investment visibility of $20 billion, revenue growth is likely to be supported in the coming years.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a correction mode, and the key reason is lower revenue visibility from the Covid-19 vaccine. However, at a forward P/E ratio of 9.8, the stock seems seriously undervalued. PFE stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.56%.If we look beyond near-term concerns, there are several reasons to like Pfizer. The company has a product pipeline of 112 drugs, and as these candidates are commercialized, revenue growth is likely.Further, Pfizer has boosted its financial flexibility with significant free cash flows from vaccine sales. This cash is being deployed to accelerate the product pipeline.At the same time, Pfizer has been active on the inorganic growth front. The company is targeting $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue from new business deals by 2030.Recently, Pfizer announced that it will sell its full portfolio of drugs to low-income countries at no profit. The company establishing a presence in these markets could be potentially rewarding in the long term.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comAmong industrial commodity dividend stocks, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is worth buying. The 8.95% dividend yield stock has trended higher by 35% in the last six months. However, the stock still trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 11.39.Rio Tinto reported free cash flow of $7.1 billion for the first half of 2022. With an annualized FCF potential of $14 billion, the business is a cash-flow machine. This has translated into a quality balance sheet that ensures sustained dividends.It’s worth noting that Rio has guided for annual capital expenditure of $9.5 billion for 2023 and 2024. This excludes any potential mergers and acquisitions. With Rio focused on base metals like copper and lithium, the outlook is positive. These metals will remain in demand with a continued push toward green energy. As an example, Rio is already positioned to be the largest supplier of lithium in Europe in the next 15 years.Chevron Corporation (CVX)a Chevron gas stationSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is possibly among the best dividend stocks for the long term. Chevron was among the few companies that managed to generate positive operating cash flows (OCFs) when oil plunged in 2021. With low breakeven assets, the company is positioned to deliver robust cash flows.Just to put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. On an annual basis, the OCF potential is in excess of $40 billion. The company has ambitious plans to invest $15 billion to $17 billion annually in the next few years.Even after these investments, there is ample cash flow for dividend growth and share repurchases. Furthermore, Chevron reported a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Strong financial flexibility allows Chevron to make significant investments in the lower carbon business.Chevron also has a strong asset base, and the reserve replacement has been healthy. This ensures long-term cash-flow visibility and shareholder value creation.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comRetail stocks have been depressed in 2022, with inflation playing the spoilsport. However, amid the challenges, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has traded sideways in the last 12 months. A dividend yield of 0.75% might not sound attractive. However, I expect COST stock to trend higher, and there is dividend growth visibility.For the first quarter of 2023, Costco reported revenue growth of 8.1% to $53.44 billion. The key point to note is that the U.S. is staring at a potential recession. With retail spending being a key growth driver, policies are likely to be directed toward boosting spending. This will benefit Costco.It’s worth noting that Costco has 66.9 million household members. This translates into $4.3 billion in annualized membership fees. With continued expansion and high renewal rates, I expect the recurring revenue to swell. This will have a positive impact on free cash flows.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

91,ff6b97d1-9d0c-3fdb-9b56-ad2177ba5b2f,PHM,2023-01-23,7 Must-Buy Stocks if Inflation Sinks,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-buy-stocks-inflation-133217559.html,1674135137,STORY,"['FUN', 'UAL', 'WSM', 'M', 'PHM', 'TSLA', 'LOW']","[Without a doubt, inflation is decelerating in America, as the country’s Consumer Price Index actually declined 0.1% in December compared with November. If inflation continues to sink, several sectors whose performances are heavily influenced by consumers’ spending power and/or interest rate levels should outperform going forward. In this column, I will identify a number of those sectors and recommend seven stocks to buy within those spaces.Of course, the demand for housing is heavily dependent on interest rate levels since higher rates result in significantly higher mortgage payments. And if inflation slows, the Fed will stop raising interest rates sooner rather than later. As a result, a significant deceleration of inflation would be positive for housing stocks and for a number of other companies whose performance is closely linked to the housing sector.Similarly, higher interest rates raise the payments on auto loans, so automakers will benefit from lower rates. And finally, many types of consumer discretionary names would benefit from lower inflation because a decline in the inflation rate would significantly raise the discretionary income of consumers in general and of middle-class consumers in particular.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s take a look at seven stocks to buy within those sectors.TickerCompanyPriceWSMWilliams-Sonoma$124.40LOWLowe’s Companies$208.50MMacy’s$23.08PHMPulteGroup$50.97TSLATesla$128.78FUNCedar Fair$42.09UALUnited Airlines$48.86Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comIf inflation rates drop, interest rates will stop going up, greatly increasing the number of homes that Americans buy. And that trend, in turn, will help Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), a retailer that specializes in selling high-level home furniture.In a Jan. 17 interview on CNBC, WSM CEO Laura Alber said that many consumers are “still shopping” for home furniture, adding that “So many people started projects during the pandemic” that they are finishing now.Story continuesAdditionally, Alber stated that many consumers realize that entertaining at home is cheaper than taking trips, and she noted that the retailer is benefiting from greatly improved supply chains and lower costs.If inflation drops meaningfully, middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers should have much more money to spend on Williams-Sonoma’s products. (Wealthy consumers were, I believe, not meaningfully hurt by elevated inflation.)WSM stock has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of just 8.8.Lowe’s Companies (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comLike Williams’-Sonoma, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) would benefit from a rejuvenated real estate market and an increase in middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers’ purchasing power, which is why it is among the best stocks to buy during decreasing inflation.Also noteworthy is that LOW approved a rather large, new $15 billion share buyback program in December, while the company expects to generate healthy 2023 earnings per share of $13.65 to $13.80. Despite the housing slump, it expects its revenue to be roughly unchanged this year versus last year.And in a note to investors last month, Goldman Sachs wrote that it had become more bullish on the LOW stock after the retailer stated that it believes that its “weak market [forecast] is the least likely outcome for 2023.” Goldman noted that the retailer expects its 2023 operating margin to beat analysts’ average estimate, and the bank kept a “buy” rating on the shares.The LOW stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 15 and pays a 2% dividend.Macy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comMacy’s (NYSE:M) is yet another retailer that should perform better as inflation eases. As I noted earlier, the spending of middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers should be boosted the most by easing inflation. That’s because the spending of poorer consumers will still be constrained by the inflation that occurred in the past, while wealthy people were never meaningfully hurt by inflation in the first place. Since Macy’s flagship stores cater to middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers, it should get a big lift in easing inflation.Also noteworthy is that Macy’s reported significantly stronger than expected third-quarter results in November, as its Q3 EPS came in at 52 cents, well above analysts’ average outlook of 19 cents. The results showed that the retailer, which raised its full-year EPS guidance slightly, was resilient despite consumers’ goods-to-services switch and high inflation.On the other hand, the company’s revenue did drop 4% year-over-year, and earlier this month, Macy’s announced that its fiscal Q4 sales would come in at the “low to medium” portion of its previous $8.16 billion to $8.4 billion guidance. However, it reiterated its $1.47 to $1.67 Q4 EPS outlook.But a continued deceleration of inflation would definitely help Macy’s, and M stock is trading at a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of just 5.5 times. Additionally, the shares have a sizeable dividend yield of 2.8%.PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comWhile I’m far from an expert on the homebuilding sector, PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) sounds like it’s one company in the space that caters primarily to middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers. As I noted previously, I expect those consumers’ spending to get the biggest lift from a continued deceleration of inflation.According to Benzinga, Pulte “offers products to entry-level, move-up, and active-adult buyers.”PHM stock is already showing signs of recovering, as it’s up 12% so far in January and 37.5% in the last three months. Moreover, the stock’s price-earnings ratio is a very low 5.2 times.On Jan. 11, Bank of America upgraded PHM stock to “buy” from “neutral.” The firm believes that homebuilder stocks already reflect a weak housing market, and it pointed out that mortgage rates are dropping. The firm expects rates to fall further in 2023 and predicts that homebuilders will benefit from lower raw-material prices this year.And importantly, Investor’s Business Daily gives PHM a Composite Rating of 97 out of 100. The publication gives PHM an “A” when it comes to Accumulation/Distribution, which measures the extent to which institutional investors have been buying the stock in the last 13 weeks. Thus, it is among the best stocks to buy when inflation decreases.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a recent column on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the automaker is among the top stocks to buy due to many strong, positive catalysts, including a very powerful brand, the affordability of its new, full-sized truck, and the subscriptions that it’s selling.Additionally, upcoming lower interest rates, combined with its recent price cuts and the federal tax credits for which many of its EVs became eligible this year, should make it’s EVs affordable for many more middle-class and upper-middle-class Americans.Indeed, that trend already appears to be getting underway, as Elektrek earlier this week reported that the automaker was benefiting from record demand in America.Tesla’s higher sales volumes, combined with the other positive catalysts that I mentioned, will enable its overall profits to climb a great despite its price cuts that have sparked so much unjustified hand-wringing on the Street.As a result of those overdone fears, the forward price-earnings ratio of TSLA stock is a reasonable 24.5.Cedar Fair (FUN)Riders at Kings Island enjoy the suspense as they head to the top of the 215 foot tall drop on Diamondback,Source: LukeandKarla.Travel / Shutterstock.comCedar Fair (NYSE:FUN), which owns and operates amusement parks and water parks, should get a big lift from middle-class families’ increased spending power. Also likely to boost FUN stock are the large price increases that Disney (NYSE:DIS) has implemented at its parks in recent months.With the prices for Disney’s parks getting beyond the reach of many American middle-class families, the demand for Cedar Fair’s park could surge in 2023. In addition, Cedar Fair has already reported that it expects to set records for sales and adjusted EBITDA.For the third quarter, Cedar Fair reported record EBITDA, excluding certain items, and its revenue jumped 12% year-over-year.On Jan. 9, Citi wrote that it expects theme parks “to be fairly resilient” during what it predicts will be “a shallow recession.” The firm increased its price target on FUN to $49 from $47 and kept a “buy” rating on the shares.The forward price-earnings ratio of FUN stock is a reasonable 14, and it has a significant dividend yield of 2.85%. Thus it is among the top stocks to buy if inflation sinks.United Airlines (UAL)Image of the United logo on the side of a planeSource: travelview / Shutterstock.comI’ve been upbeat on United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) in the past, writing last April that “UAL stock is likely to climb as travel continues to become more popular.”When inflation decelerates, oil prices tend to be held in check, and such a trend is positive for UAL and its peers. Additionally, declines in inflation will provide middle-class and upper-middle-class consumers with more money to spend on trips, giving UAL another upbeat catalyst.Moreover, United is continuing to benefit from the travel rebound generally, as it reported significantly stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results, including a 51% year-over-year revenue increase, on Jan. 17. And impressively, the company’s Q4 operating margin rose over two percentage points versus Q4 of 2019.Also likely to boost UAL for the next several months is the recent debacle that one of its key competitors, Southwestern (NYSE:LUV), suffered.The forward price-earnings ratio of UAL stock is a low 8.8.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Tech Stocks With Low PE Ratio.Tech stocks were crushed in 2022 amid a major growth stock rout that started when market optimism began to recede amid rising inflation, rate hikes, supply chain issues and Russia-Ukraine war. However, some analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. If it does, tech stocks with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations could bring strong returns for shareholders. According to a Bloomberg report published in December, several notable analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. In a Bloomberg News survey, about 71% of respondents said they think US equities would rise in the year, versus 19% forecasting declines. The survey included 134 fund managers, including those from BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Amundi SA. However, the respondents said that the stock market could again get hit if inflation persists or if the economy goes into deep recession.The report quoted Pia Haak, chief investment officer at Sweden’s Swedbank Robur. The analyst said even though the economy might face a recession and falling profits in 2023, they have already discounted part of it in 2022.“We will have better visibility coming into 2023 and this will hopefully help markets,” Haak added.However, the market recovery won’t be easy or smooth, many analysts believe. Mislav Matejka, a global equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. believes the risks the stock market saw in 2022 aren’t over and this makes the analyst “nervous about the outlook” of 2023, especially for the first half of the period, according to a separate Bloomberg report.A latest report from investment firm Stifel also gives an opportunity to get an idea about what to expect in 2023. The firm said it expects economic growth to be muted in 2023.  It still sees a “reasonable” chance of a soft landing but an equal chance of a mild recession. The report said that job losses and volatility would offset the wage gains and consumer benefits from decreasing inflation in 2023.Story continuesThe Stifel report said that as we will move into mid-2023, investors can begin to see a new “growth cycle” fueled by optimism if the Federal Reserve decides to stop rate hikes and China continues policy of economic reopening after lifting COVID restrictions. These factors, according to the report, can lift the stock market higher in 2023. Stifel expects earnings growth in the 0%–5% range for 2023. The firm also expects S&amp;P 500 total return of roughly 6% and a related price target of 4,000 at year-end.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to identify tech stocks with PE ratios under 15.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) P/E Ratio: 12.94Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Yet another semiconductor stock in our list, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) has lost about 33% over the past year. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)’ management is trying to cut the company's reliance on mobile revenue. As of FY’22, Broad market revenue accounts for about 36% of the total revenue of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Back in November, investment firm KGI Securities analyst Derek Chang upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target.A total of 39 hedge funds out of the 920 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). The total value of these stakes was $964 million. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management is the biggest stakeholder of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), with a $142.4 million stake.Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)P/E Ratio: 12.91Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is one of the famous data storage products companies in the world. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has lost about 44% in value over the past year. However, some catalysts point to possible growth in the near future. Earlier this month, Benchmark analyst Mark Miller increased his rating for Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) to Hold from Sell after media reports suggested Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has re-started merger talks with Japan's Kioxia. The analyst said that the memory chip market may be headed towards a recovery from one of the “worst downturn in years”. However, the analyst warned investors that some factors can still delay this possible rebound. These factors include expectations that the PC, data center and mobile chip sales would continue to remain soft in 2023.7. Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX)P/E Ratio: 11.12Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Data storage products company Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX)’s shares have taken a beating over the past year, losing almost half of their value. Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) is also expected to continue to suffer from the volatility in the data storage market in the months to come. That’s why Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is only suitable for those who are willing to wait. In November, after Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) conducted a debt exchange to boost its balance sheet, Susquehanna updated its estimates for Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX). According to new estimates, the investment firm expects Seagate’s fiscal 2023 earnings per share to be $1.79, down from a prior view of $1.87 and below the consensus estimate of $1.98 per share.As of the end of the third quarter, 28 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX).

While these two stocks remain inexpensive on a valuation basis, they clearly saw a business slowdown over the last two quarters.”6. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)P/E Ratio: 9.82Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is a hybrid Cloud and data management company. Over the past 12 months NetApp, Inc.

Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) recent US$695m drop adds to long-term losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-consider-drastic-113915682.html,1674473955,STORY,['VFC'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 90% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.8% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 55% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell V.F, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about V.F. View our latest analysis for V.F ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About V.F?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.V.F already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at V.F's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. V.F is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Banking Investments is the second largest shareholder owning 10.0% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 8.6% of the company stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of V.FThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of V.F. Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$41m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over V.F. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  V.F is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those can't be ignored...Ultimately the future is most important.

106,fc9d301d-2295-3bce-aac9-6b3b596d6147,GM,2023-01-23,7 Electric Vehicle Stocks Vying for Tesla’s Crown,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-electric-vehicle-stocks-vying-225539051.html,1674168939,STORY,"['TSLA', 'TM', 'F', 'GM', 'NIO']","[There’s an unrelenting competition to dethrone Tesla, as the world’s most notable EV company. In fact, there are dozens of EV firms and electric vehicle stocks ying for Tesla’s crown. In the U.S., legacy automakers continue to pour significant resources into diversifying their respective product mixes toward electric vehicles. The same is true for other notable, household-names, and legacy automakers globally. In China, the world’s largest EV market, a handful of manufacturers have established strong market share and continue to show massive potential. In the U.S., the picture is the same with a few SPAC-funded upstarts emerging as legitimate threats to Tesla’s market dominance. FFord$12.18GMGeneral Motors$35.73TMToyota$144.18NIONio$10.77BYDDYBYD Company$58.21LCIDLucid Group$7.45FSRFisker$6.63Electric Vehicle Stocks: Ford (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comInvestors continue to be very interested in Ford (NYSE:F) stock because of the EV opportunity. Ford’s stock is priced inexpensively both in terms of its $13 share price and its P/E ratio which makes it cheaper than 86% of industry competitors. The general notion is that as Ford directs substantial resources into EV development its share price can rapidly increase. That thought stems from the massive valuations afforded to EV companies including Tesla. It is a generational opportunity that Ford cannot afford to ignore. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFord is telegraphing a massive continued investment and expects its EV production rate to reach 600,000 vehicles by late this year. It expects for production rate to reach 2 million vehicles annually by 2026. Ford’s EV push efforts have not translated into skyrocketing share prices as yet. Early in 2022, Ford quashed rumors that it might spin off its EV vehicles as a separate company. Such a move would imply significantly higher valuations but remains conjecture at this point. Story continuesElectric Vehicle Stocks: General Motors (GM) Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock is subject to many of the same factors as Ford’s in relation to electric vehicles. The same potential benefits apply to GM as it continues its EV development. Like Ford, General Motors’ stock is undervalued based on traditional metrics including its P/E ratio. General Motors delivered 39,179 EVs in 2022. Those EV vehicle deliveries accounted for 1.7% of the company’s U.S. leading 2,274,088 vehicle deliveries during the year.  That puts GM in an interesting position as it relates to EV leaders and its own approach toward the market. Given that GM’s internal combustion vehicles are top sellers in the U.S. market it would be unwise to lean too heavily into EVs, potentially eroding its strength. But at the same time, if GM wants to eventually surpass Tesla’s sales, it cannot wait forever. Tesla delivered 1.31 million vehicles in 2022. That means for every General Motors EV delivered, Tesla delivered 33.2 EVs. Electric Vehicle Stocks: Toyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comToyota (NYSE:TM) is the strongest legacy competitor challenging Tesla for dominance of electric vehicle stocks. The company sold 9.56 million vehicles during the period between Jan. and Nov. Its strongest competitor, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), delivered 8.3 million vehicles in all of 2022, making Toyota the leading global automobile by sales volume for the third straight year. Toyota sold 504,016 electric vehicles in the U.S. in 2022. The rub here is that Toyota sells a significant number of hybrid-electric vehicles as a portion of those strong overall sales. Toyota has stated that it plans to launch 30 fully electric vehicles in the future. The company is known for its generally conservative business operations. If something isn’t broken, Toyota doesn’t ‘fix’ it. That’s a big part of the reason the company is leaning more slowly into developing an all-electric lineup than its competitors. The other part of that slower development is the fact that Toyota’s electric-hybrid technology has been so successful and is so well regarded. Nio (NIO)Shanghai.China-Feb.2021: exterior of NIO store. A Chinese electric car brandSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comNio (NYSE:NIO) is one of the marquee names when it comes to Chinese electric vehicle stocks to buy. It has become synonymous with China’s booming EV industry with the company delivering 122,486 total vehicles in 2022. That figure represented a 34% increase in deliveries year-over-year. The company delivered 15,815 vehicles during the month of Dec. alone. That was an increase of 50.8% YoY, as well as a record monthly high. The company remains a homegrown upstart champion in a Chinese market that is the world leader in EVs. There were 5.67 million EVs (1)sold in China in 2022. More than 4 million of those were all-electric vehicles. Nio will remain an important manufacturer challenging Tesla into the future. But as a stock, NIO shares have certain issues worth noting. The shares sit decidedly in the growth sector which has been marked by a severe decline as the Fed reins in inflation with rising interest rates. Nio’s revenues increased 32.6% in Q3, to $1.83 billion. However, it reported a net loss of $577.8 million at the same time. This climate makes it very volatile. BYD (BYDDY)BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIt will probably surprise readers to learn BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is the world’s largest seller of EVs. The company delivered 1.86 million EVs in 2022, significantly outpacing Tesla and its 1.31 million deliveries during the same period. The Chinese manufacturer sold a record 235,197 EVs in Dec. alone. U.S. investors may be less familiar with the name simply for the fact that Nio trades its shares on the New York Stock Exchange while BYD’s shares trade over the counter. That said, BYD stock is higher priced – implying more safety – and possesses significant upside beyond its current price. BYD sold 683,440 EVs in the fourth quarter, up 157% on a year-over-year basis. The company is interesting for several reasons. Warren Buffett backs the firm which is expecting to deliver roughly 2 million vehicles in 2023. That’s similar to what many analysts expect Tesla to deliver in the coming year. The other interesting aspect of the competition between the two firms is that BYD delivered fewer all-electric vehicles in 2022, 911,140, than Tesla and its 1.31 million all-electric deliveries. Lucid (LCID)Lucid Motors (LCID) Air Dream Edition Luxury Electric car and it's technology on display in Lucid (LCID) Studio ShowroomSource: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comLucid (NASDAQ:LCID) is aiming directly for Tesla’s Model S. The company is led by former Tesla executive Peter Rawlinson. Lucid’s large Air lineup competes directly with Tesla’s Model S vehicle that dominates the EV luxury range. The positive news for Lucid is that Tesla sells far fewer Model S vehicles than it does Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla delivered 23,464 Model S vehicles between January and September last year. Meanwhile, Lucid delivered 1,932 of its Air sedans in Q4 while producing 3,493 in total. Lucid has dealt with wavering production expectations throughout the last year. Production was expected to hit 20,000 and was then reduced to a range between 12-14,000. That was again reduced to a range between 6-7,0000. Lucid ended up producing 7,180 vehicles during 2022, an arguable success. What’s important to note about Lucid is that the company models Tesla in many respects. It completed its own manufacturing plant and can absolutely erode the Model S’ market share if its Air sedan lineup performs well. Fisker (FSR)The Fisker logo hangs on display at the November 2011 International Auto Show.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comFisker (NYSE:FSR) is a company that you want to see succeed. The company developed EVs for some time but failed to meet the mark. However, it reinvented itself during the pandemic, seizing upon a wave of SPAC funding that the company used to reinvigorate its brand. The company utilized blank-check funding to design and outsource the manufacturing of its Ocean SUV to Magna International (NYSE:MGA) rather than investing in expensive, ground-up manufacturing. The result is that the company began production of the Ocean SUV on time, Nov. 17, 2022, as promised. The company owns the intellectual property associated with the Ocean, which had caused controversy recently. Fisker plans to produce 42,400 Ocean vehicles in 2023 with 15,000 deliveries expected in Q3. U.S. production could begin in 2024 as well. The Ocean is priced from $37,499, making it a lower-priced alternative to many of its competitors already for sale in the U.S. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

107,20ac7bbb-0fbe-3b93-8f68-75119903e1df,MKC,2023-01-23,McCormick's (NYSE:MKC) earnings growth rate lags the 9.2% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormicks-nyse-mkc-earnings-growth-120528881.html,1674475528,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V']","[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) share price is up 44% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 33% (ignoring dividends).Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.5%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for McCormick There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, McCormick achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.2% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on McCormick's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, McCormick's TSR for the last 5 years was 56%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 10% in the twelve months, McCormick shareholders did even worse, losing 16% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years.

These securities are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings, creating buying opportunities for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market.These names should pay off handsomely over the long term. Here are seven of the most undervalued stocks to buy for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWSMWilliams-Sonoma$123.70WWWWolverine Worldwide$13.53HOGHarley-Davidson$43.19HRBH&amp;R Block$37.44KRKroger$44.45SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$85.83Williams-Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comKitchenware and home furnishing company Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) might not be on most investors’ radars, but it should be. The San Francisco-based concern’s stock has pulled back 13% in the last 12 months to $123 a share. The price-earnings ratio of WSM stock is currently 7.30, which is about half that of the S&amp;P 500. And the shares pay a quarterly dividend of 78 cents a share, resulting in a yield of 2.50%.Other reasons to consider adding Williams-Sonoma to your portfolio include the fact that the company has no debt, a strong online and social media presence ( it has 1.6 million followers on Instagram), and a net income margin of 13.5%. Also noteworthy is that WSM has increased its earnings per share (EPS) at an average clip of 50% over the last three years. Finally, Williams-Sonoma’s 22% revenue growth in 2021 was more than triple the 7%  average growth rate of the U.S. furniture industry.Add in $2.5 billion of stock buybacks in the past five years, and WSM stock looks like a no-brainer. Investors should buy the dip of this undervalued stock.Story continuesWolverine World Wide (WWW)A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comInvestors might not be familiar with Wolverine World Wide (NYSE:WWW), but they certainly know its products. The Michigan-based footwear company makes some of the most popular sneakers and shoes in the world. Its portfolio of brands includes Hush Puppies, Merrell, Keds, Saucony and Top Sider, to name only a few. Wolverine also has agreements in place to make footwear for other companies such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT).Wolverine thrived before the Covid-19 pandemic. In February 2020, WWW stock was trading above $30 a share. However, retail store closures during the pandemic hurt its business, and it has struggled to overcome excess inventories as the economy has reopened, leading it to implement discounts and markdowns.Consequently, Wolverine’s stock has declined 47% over the last year, and the stock’s low price-earnings ratio of 6.86 indicates that it is undervalued at its current levels.Despite its woes, WWW stock pays a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which equates to a significant yield of 3%. Look for this stock to rebound once WWW’s inventories are adjusted and inflation continues to ease.Harley-Davidson (HOG)A close-up photograph of the tank to a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with raindrops on it.Source: Alex Erofeenkov / Shutterstock.comMotorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) is a legendary company not just in the U.S. but all over the world. A going concern since 1903, Harley-Davidson continues to make some of the most popular, in-demand motorcycles. And while its stock has been on an upswing over the past six months, its long-term performance has lagged the market. In the past 12 months, HOG stock has gained 29%, which is great. But over the last five years, the stock is down 22%.Harley-Davidson’s current P/E ratio of nine is also low and shows the stock is a bargain at its current levels. HOG also pays a quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 1.45%The reasons for the shares’ long-term underperformance are many. The company’s efforts to expand its brand into other areas of the motorcycle ecosystem such as apparel, accessories, and lifestyle products have had mixed results. And some investors have been concerned about the costs and uncertainty associated with Harley Davidson’s plans to pivot to electric motorcycles.Still, the strong brand awareness and popularity of its motorcycles make HOG stock an undervalued stocks to buy for 2023.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comTax season is fast approaching, making it a good time to consider H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB). The Kansas City-based tax preparation company had a spectacular 2022, with its share price gaining 75% in a down market.But even with that monster growth, HRB stock still looks undervalued . The stock’s P/E ratio is only 11.83 despite the big advance, and the median price target on the stock is $48.Moving forward, HRB stock is likely to continue benefitting from the company’s strong earnings growth. Analysts, on average, expect the firm’s EPS to increase at a mean rate of 12.5%. Analysts’ mean estimates calls for its earnings in 2023 and 2024 to grow 8.3% and 9.8%, respectively. And H&amp;R Block continues to execute on its five-year strategic plan, called “Block Horizons,” that focuses on building stronger relationships with small businesses and expanding its suite of digital tax tools.HRB stock also has a dividend yield of 3.1%. And, given the nature of its business, investors can have confidence in H&amp;R Block’s record keeping.Kroger (KR)A Kroger (KR) logo on a building.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs the largest supermarket operator and fifth largest retailer in the U.S., Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE:KR) should get more attention from the investing community, especially given its relatively cheap valuation. At Friday’s closing share price of $44.39, KR stock is trading 35% below its 52-week high of $62.78. The P/E ratio of 13.9 is slightly below the S&amp;P 500 mean of 16 and far below the ratio of competitors such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).Kroger’s diminished valuation is due almost entirely to uncertainty surrounding its proposed $24.6 billion merger with its rival supermarket chain ,Albertsons (NYSE:ACI), a deal that will solidify Kroger as the biggest supermarket chain in America by revenue.However, while the merger still needs regulatory approval, it remains on track to close in 2024. But even without the deal, Kroger remains a solid long-term stock to own. It also has a dividend yield of 2.34%.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comTool and hardware giant Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) has seen better days. The Connecticut-based company’s share price has slumped 51% in the last 12 months, pulling its P/E ratio down to 9.4. Over the past five years, SWK stock has decreased 50%.The prolonged slump is the result of cost pressures due to international trade tariffs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and increased commodity prices, all of which were an issue for the company before the pandemic. Bloated inventories have also been a problem.However, Stanley Black &amp; Decker is making moves that will turn its business around. These include cutting costs by $2 billion over the next three years, with $1 billion of the cost reductions slated to take place in 2023. Stanley Black &amp; Decker also plans to reduce the number of products it sells, utilize fewer suppliers, and revamp its supply chain. Last year, the company sold its electronic security and automatic doors businesses to help refocus on its hammers and drills.If the turnaround succeeds, investors can expect the stock to rally. Worth noting is that SWK stock has a dividend yield 0f 3.75% at present.Goodyear Rubber &amp; Tire (GT)Interesting Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (GT) Put and Call OptionsSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comFew stocks look as undervalued as Goodyear Rubber &amp; Tire (NASDAQ:GT). GT stock has fallen nearly 50% in the last year, and its P/E ratio currently sits at 3.8. Over the past five years, the company’s share price has plunged nearly 70%. This is a truly dreadful performance for a company that is a household name in the U.S.The Ohio-based company that has been in business since 1898 had struggled with rising competition and slowing sales for years before the Covid-19 pandemic. But in 2022, higher raw materials prices and the negative impacts of a strong U.S. dollar caused the share price to crater.Management is trying to evolve. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Goodyear unveiled a new tire that contains 90% sustainable materials.The company has let it be known that, after more than a century, it is trying to lessen its reliance on rubber. Time will tell if the shift works. But some analysts are starting to warm to GT stock. Keybanc Capital Markets, for example, recently placed an “overweight” rating and a $39 price target on the stock.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in KR.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV), which is up 39%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 18% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 12% in the last year , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Travelers Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Travelers Companies achieved compound earnings per share growth of 17% per year. The average annual share price increase of 11% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Travelers Companies the TSR over the last 3 years was 49%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Travelers Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) share price is up 79% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 33% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 11% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Air Products and Chemicals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Air Products and Chemicals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Air Products and Chemicals, it has a TSR of 102% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Air Products and Chemicals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 15% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals  that you should be aware of.But note: Air Products and Chemicals may not be the best stock to buy.

""The Way of Water"" debuted in late December, 13 years after the original ""Avatar"" introduced the lush world of Pandora and became a worldwide phenomenon.Box office sales for ""The Way of Water"" totaled $2.024 billion on Sunday, according to Disney estimates. After six weekends in theaters, it ranks as the sixth-highest grossing movie of all time. Roughly $1.4 billion of ticket sales have come from international markets outside the United States and Canada.""It's an unqualified success,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. ""Any time you are in the billions you are in the pantheon of top franchises.""Disney has not disclosed the movie's budget, but the Hollywood Reporter said it cost at least $350 million to produce plus marketing costs. Studios split ticket sales with theaters.The strong reception for the film also should help attract crowds to a Pandora area at Walt Disney World in Florida, analysts said, and spark merchandise sales for years to come.""Avatar"" was touted as one of the jewels in Disney's $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets in 2019, a property it could elevate alongside Marvel and Star Wars. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who is seeking a seat on the Disney board, has argued that the company paid too much for Fox.A third ""Avatar"" movie, which Cameron has already filmed, is scheduled to debut in December 2024. The fourth and fifth installments are slated for December 2026 and December 2028.The original ""Avatar"" enchanted audiences with groundbreaking visuals that told the story of Pandora's blue, 9-foot-tall Na'vi people. The 2009 movie remains the highest-grossing film in history with $2.9 billion in global ticket sales.Story continuesIn ""The Way of Water,"" actors Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake Sully and Neytiri 10 years later, now parents of five children.

Virgin Media O2 selected Juniper as the technology partner for this strategic upgrade for numerous reasons, including its previous track record as a key networking provider for more than ten years with Virgin Media and O2 before their joint venture in 2021. Another significant factor was Juniper’s ability to deliver compelling economics for Virgin Media O2.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Tech Stocks With Low PE Ratio.Tech stocks were crushed in 2022 amid a major growth stock rout that started when market optimism began to recede amid rising inflation, rate hikes, supply chain issues and Russia-Ukraine war. However, some analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. If it does, tech stocks with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations could bring strong returns for shareholders. According to a Bloomberg report published in December, several notable analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. In a Bloomberg News survey, about 71% of respondents said they think US equities would rise in the year, versus 19% forecasting declines. The survey included 134 fund managers, including those from BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Amundi SA. However, the respondents said that the stock market could again get hit if inflation persists or if the economy goes into deep recession.The report quoted Pia Haak, chief investment officer at Sweden’s Swedbank Robur. The analyst said even though the economy might face a recession and falling profits in 2023, they have already discounted part of it in 2022.“We will have better visibility coming into 2023 and this will hopefully help markets,” Haak added.However, the market recovery won’t be easy or smooth, many analysts believe. Mislav Matejka, a global equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. believes the risks the stock market saw in 2022 aren’t over and this makes the analyst “nervous about the outlook” of 2023, especially for the first half of the period, according to a separate Bloomberg report.A latest report from investment firm Stifel also gives an opportunity to get an idea about what to expect in 2023. The firm said it expects economic growth to be muted in 2023.  It still sees a “reasonable” chance of a soft landing but an equal chance of a mild recession. The report said that job losses and volatility would offset the wage gains and consumer benefits from decreasing inflation in 2023.Story continuesThe Stifel report said that as we will move into mid-2023, investors can begin to see a new “growth cycle” fueled by optimism if the Federal Reserve decides to stop rate hikes and China continues policy of economic reopening after lifting COVID restrictions. These factors, according to the report, can lift the stock market higher in 2023. Stifel expects earnings growth in the 0%–5% range for 2023. The firm also expects S&amp;P 500 total return of roughly 6% and a related price target of 4,000 at year-end.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to identify tech stocks with PE ratios under 15.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”8.

Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has lost about 44% in value over the past year. However, some catalysts point to possible growth in the near future.

The analyst said that the memory chip market may be headed towards a recovery from one of the “worst downturn in years”.

Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) is also expected to continue to suffer from the volatility in the data storage market in the months to come.

Businesses of all sizes are encouraging workers to get back into the office, citing all kinds of reasons, from increased creativity to better morale. In March 2022, a survey conducted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) found that  50% of companies wanted workers back in the office five days a week. However, when The Conference Board asked more than 1,100 global corporate executives, including 670 CEOs, about their company’s plans for remote work in 2023, only 3% of U.S.-based respondents said they would reduce remote work. So, while there have been some high-profile return-to-work announcements recently, hybrid work is here to stay. Moreover, research shows that people are more productive in a hybrid work environment. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI’ve pulled together three high-profile public companies that have issued return-to-work mandates. One is a buy, while two should be sold. AXPAmerican Express$146.88TSLATesla $127.17GSGoldman Sachs$350.65Return-to-Work Buy: American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) might not be one of the top-performing stocks over the past five years, but it has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which is half the battle. Plus, it provides a decent, if not spectacular, dividend payment with a current yield of 1.4%. And if you’re basing your decision on whether a company is open-minded about a work-from-anywhere model, as I am, AXP is a flat-out buy. Companies that think about their employees as assets rather than cannon fodder realize that the easiest way to keep them mentally sharp and physically fit is not to send them on the road every chance they get. It saves money, time and an employee’s sanity. Anyone who’s traveled for business knows that it gets old fast. “‘In the past we just got on planes and flew around the world,’ said Sandy Torchia, KPMG’s vice chair of talent and culture. ‘Now we take a step back and say, what is the intention of this interaction?’” the Los Angeles Times reported.  Story continuesAmerican Express officially launched Amex Flex in March. This model allows employees to choose where they want to work, whether in the office, at home or a combination of both.Courtney Dyce, a senior manager with the company, works two days in the office and three at home. In an August company blog post, Dyce wrote: “With Amex Flex, the ability to be present in your child’s life is amazing. I always wanted to give that to my children, but I also wanted to have something for myself, as well. I want to work and I want to impact people, so it’s a balancing act and a huge weight and responsibility.”Unlike the next company on our list, American Express has chosen to treat its employees as adults.Return-to-Work Sell: Tesla (TSLA)A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla (TSLA) store with several vehicles visible behind a glass doorSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.comTesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) return-to-work policy was made explicitly clear in a June 2022 email sent to employees by CEO Elon Musk: “Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week… If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.”In November, Musk did the same thing at recently acquired Twitter, forcing employees back to the office and setting the expectation of “intense work.”I’ve been a big fan of Musk’s innovation for more than a decade, saying America needs more Teslas. But the billionaire’s complete lack of understanding regarding human nature suggests Tesla could be ready to follow Twitter into a self-induced implosion. Earlier this month, Tesla cut prices on its Model 3 in the U.S. by 14% and its Model Y by nearly 20%. The company is trying to capture market share at the expense of profits in a move similar to what Jeff Bezos might have done in years past with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The tweets from irate Tesla customers have been relentless, such as this one from @MarianneSimmons on Jan. 14: “@elonmusk Still no public comment for us @Tesla owners who recently purchased your cars and whom you are now screwing over with the ~20% price reductions? I NEVER thought of buying any other EV prior to this but I’m in the @LucidMotors showroom [right now] and they’re looking promising.”The emperor wears no clothes. Tesla is a big sell on the news. Return-to-Work Sell: Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comI remember when David Solomon succeeded Lloyd Blankfein as CEO of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in October 2018. Many of the stories at the time highlighted his off-work gig as DJ “D-Sol.” He was the ultimate anti-banker banker. Only as it turns out, Solomon is just as uptight as the rest of the banking community. At least, that’s the impression I get from his old-school, five-days-a-week return-to-work program that kicked off in early 2022. In October, Solomon told CNBC about 65% of its staff was back in the office full-time. Perhaps Solomon should have been paying more attention to Marcus, Goldman’s failed consumer banking business, than to who was in the office. The bank reported a 66% year-over-year drop in Q4 profits thanks in large part to ventures like Marcus. As a result of its stumble, Goldman plans to lay off up to 3,200 people, depriving them of their jobs and annual bonuses.  “I don’t want rules. I want a culture where we show up, serve our clients. We work hard. We mentor our people, we teach our people, we strive for excellence,” Solomon told CNBC in October. But rules are precisely what he’s trying to impose by forcing employees back to the office five days a week. He doesn’t realize that the work world has changed permanently. Whining about the good old days won’t bring them back. Sell GS.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Tech Stocks With Low PE Ratio.Tech stocks were crushed in 2022 amid a major growth stock rout that started when market optimism began to recede amid rising inflation, rate hikes, supply chain issues and Russia-Ukraine war. However, some analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. If it does, tech stocks with solid fundamentals and attractive valuations could bring strong returns for shareholders. According to a Bloomberg report published in December, several notable analysts believe the market could rebound in 2023. In a Bloomberg News survey, about 71% of respondents said they think US equities would rise in the year, versus 19% forecasting declines. The survey included 134 fund managers, including those from BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Amundi SA. However, the respondents said that the stock market could again get hit if inflation persists or if the economy goes into deep recession.The report quoted Pia Haak, chief investment officer at Sweden’s Swedbank Robur. The analyst said even though the economy might face a recession and falling profits in 2023, they have already discounted part of it in 2022.“We will have better visibility coming into 2023 and this will hopefully help markets,” Haak added.However, the market recovery won’t be easy or smooth, many analysts believe. Mislav Matejka, a global equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. believes the risks the stock market saw in 2022 aren’t over and this makes the analyst “nervous about the outlook” of 2023, especially for the first half of the period, according to a separate Bloomberg report.A latest report from investment firm Stifel also gives an opportunity to get an idea about what to expect in 2023. The firm said it expects economic growth to be muted in 2023.  It still sees a “reasonable” chance of a soft landing but an equal chance of a mild recession. The report said that job losses and volatility would offset the wage gains and consumer benefits from decreasing inflation in 2023.Story continuesThe Stifel report said that as we will move into mid-2023, investors can begin to see a new “growth cycle” fueled by optimism if the Federal Reserve decides to stop rate hikes and China continues policy of economic reopening after lifting COVID restrictions. These factors, according to the report, can lift the stock market higher in 2023. Stifel expects earnings growth in the 0%–5% range for 2023. The firm also expects S&amp;P 500 total return of roughly 6% and a related price target of 4,000 at year-end.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article we used stock screeners to identify tech stocks with PE ratios under 15.

155,9275e1b2-d534-33f4-bb8f-06eb9f1b5115,GE,2023-01-23,25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-strongest-countries-europe-military-235824914.html,1674431904,STORY,"['GE', 'LMT', 'GD']","[In this article, we take a look at the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power. You can skip our detailed analysis of the European military dynamics and go directly to 10 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military Power.The countries in Europe are aggressively increasing their arms procurement and military readiness in the wake of the Ukraine war. Apart from being militarily ready, the build-up is also meant to aid Ukraine in its resistance against Russia. In this regard, Germany is exceptionally important, since its military industry plays a crucial role in European defense. On January 20, western nations agreed to ramp up their military support for Ukraine. However, Germany has so far paused its delivery of indigenously-made Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. According to the newly appointed German defense minister Boris Postrius, the decision is motivated out of a need for “risk assessment” of such a move.  This, however, did not prevent other European countries like Poland, Finland and Baltic countries from moving ahead with plans to deliver their own Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine. Despite German hesitance on Leopard-2 deliveries, the country is set to deliver indigenously made Marder infantry vehicles and Cheetah anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine due to an agreement signed with the US in December, 2022.Europe's Military Preparation: NumbersAccording to the European Defense Agency, European military spending stood at $231 billion in 2021, a 6% increase from the previous year. It was the seventh year of back to back growth in military spending on the continent. The spending was at a historic low in 2014, at 1.3% of EU’s GDP. However, the Russian takeover of Crimea in the same year, followed by the Trump administration’s insistence on an increase in military contributions by other NATO members, led to a consistent increase in spending observed in the following years, aggregating at a 32% in real terms in 2021. In June, 2022, the German lower house parliament approved a defense fund of over $100 billion that was announced in February of last year in response to the Ukrainian invasion. The fund is aimed at topping-up Germany’s regular defense budget over the course of next few years to help rebuild its military.Story continuesThe fund should enable it to meet NATO’s 2% defense-spending target, which would make Germany the third biggest military spender behind the US and China. In that respect, the increase in military spending in Europe is likely to continue and may even accelerate. Current projections put forward by EDA show a growth of $76 billion in defense expenditures by 2025.How the Defense Sector Will Benefit?The increasing spending is boosting European arms manufacturers’ balance sheets. Companies like Dassault Aviation,  Hensoldt AG and Rheinmetall AG have greatly benefited. The announcement of the German defense fund that we have discussed above, led to 89% and 49% in trading gains for the German radar and sensor company Hensoldt AG and armor-vehicle manufacturer Rheinmetall AG respectively, in February. The French aircraft manufacturer, Dassault Aviation SE also saw gains of 11%.As of 2022, Rheinmetall AG was reported to be increasing the production of tanks from 40,000 units per year to 240,000 units per year. In the same year, contracts for the Eurodrone project, which is expected to reduce Europe’s reliance on Israeli drones, were signed by Germany, France, Spain and Italy. These contracts were awarded to Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA) by OCCAR. Airbus SE (PARIS:AIR.PA), on the other hand, has chosen  Avivo Aero, owned by the US-based General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), for the design and production of the drone’s engine. Apart from the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), other US defense corporations like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are also enhancing European defense capabilities. Its stealth aircraft - F-35 Lightning-II, is included in several European countries’ air force inventories.In a bid to aggressively revamp its military, Germany has announced further procurement of 35 F35s from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a $14 billion deal, the first eight of which will be delivered to the country in 2026.  As the west continues to rearm itself and bolster Ukrainian military support, the defense sector is expected to be an outperformer in the years to come.Let’s now move on to the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power. 25 Strongest Countries in Europe by Military PowerPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe’ve defined militarily strong European countries as ones that have advanced strategic military assets, geographical advantages, and logistical and financial capability. The last metric is important since financial capacity is a direct determinant of military capability.For this purpose, we have first identified the top 25 European countries in the Global Firepower Index of 2023 and ranked them as such, then we have used the GDPs of these countries to rank them separately. Then we've averaged out the rankings for our list. For countries with the same averaged-out ranking, we’ve used their ranking in Global Firepower Index as a tiebreaker. At discretion, we’ve discussed the size of some of the countries’ military assets, especially naval and air fleets since they are the primary components of military power. For militarily important countries, we’ve also discussed their cyberwarfare capabilities, number of military bases around the world and space capabilities for military purposes. For this, we’ve sourced data from The Power Atlas by the European Council on Foreign Relations. For some countries, we have also discussed military spending, and have obtained the data from the World Bank. Here are the 25 strongest countries in Europe by military power.25. BelarusGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 23 GDP Ranking: 24 Average Ranking: 23.5Belarus is a close Russian ally in its war against Ukraine and is one of the strongest countries in Europe in terms of military strength.

Meta lost more than half its value, and Amazon nearly that. Even Apple lost one-quarter of its value, its market cap falling below $2 trillion.You can blame the Fed or the Czars’ own mistakes. Apple became dependent on China. Microsoft saw its Windows franchise crumble with PC sales. Alphabet lost billions of dollars on free services like Gmail. Amazon found itself winning a market with Alexa but failed to profit from it. Meta saw its Facebook franchise collapse while seeking to build a metaverse. In 2023 investors are looking beyond the Czars for cloud profits. Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) and other data center REITs offer dividend income and a home for companies seeking independence from expensive cloud services. Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and other security companies offer the one service every company doing business in the cloud online must-have.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNone of this means the Czars won’t come back. I own shares in most of them. At the end of this gallery, you’ll see my favorite for 2023 profit. But if you’re going to make big money in tech markets, you always look for the next big thing.EQIXEquinox$702.76PANWPalo Alto$140.71PTCPTC$127.57GEHCGE HealthCare$63.94AMZNAmazon$93.68Equinix (EQIX)an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lightsSource: ShutterstockRecently, 37 Signals CTO David Hansson said his company spent $3.2 million on Amazon Web Services last year. The bills moved him to quit the cloud.  He bought Dell Technologies (NASDAQ:DELL) hardware and promised savings would follow.But while you can quit the cloud, you can’t quit the cloud world. A data center still needs cloud connections and a secure location. That means 2023 should be a great year for companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX).Story continuesEquinix is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) specializing in data centers. It builds these data centers with debt and pays out profits in dividends. The data centers are rented to companies like 37 Signals and include networked connections to major clouds. Clients put their servers in the space for the same reason they rent offices downtown.Equinix is not a cheap stock. The current price-to-earnings ratio is 95, and the current dividend yields just 1.7%. But it is a long-term winner, with 20% per year over the last five when capital gains are factored in.  The industry has been consolidating around Equinix and rival Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), another stock worth considering.Palo Alto Networks (PANW)Wars and cybercrime make security a priority for every customer, even one built into the cloud. The leader in the space is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). Palo Alto is down 16% over the last year, roughly in line with the S&amp;P 500. It was recently trading at $140. That’s 8 times last year’s revenue, and it loses money regularly. But revenue has doubled since 2020, and it has averaged gains of 35% per year over the last five years.Palo Alto’s biggest problem is that leadership is expensive. About one-quarter of revenue was spent on research last year. There are always new breakthroughs being announced, new start-ups with new approaches,  and new more being funded. It’s not easy being the King of Security. You must run fast to keep your place.Acquisitions are also necessary to stay ahead, the most recent being Cider Security. New infrastructure is needed to manage it all. Palo Alto is known for its Prisma Cloud, aimed at preventing cyberattacks in the cloud. It is also led by Nikesh Arora, formerly number two at SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). A fall of 18% in December makes Palo Alto’s rich valuation look more attractive.When the tech market comes back, Palo Alto and other security stocks will be in the thick of it. So will rivals like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK).PTC (PTC)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockThe Internet isn’t just for people anymore. It’s for companies like PTC (NASDAQ:PTC).Most Internet traffic today is already untouched by human hands. It moves from sensors to servers and back again, appearing to managers only in the form of online reports. It’s on engines warning of maintenance issues before things break. It’s all part of what I call the Machine Internet, a trend I’ve been studying for 20 years. In the past, I called these “always on” technologies, and analysts called them the Internet of Things. We’re now moving toward connecting things into systems to run factories, hospitals, and entire cities.PTC has been in this game from the beginning, when the niche was called Product Lifecycle Management, back in the 1990s. Through Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), which took a stake of nearly 9% in 2018, PTC has been building out the portfolio, scoring double ROK’s gains. Over the last year, the stock is up 18%, and the market cap is now $14.2 billion on sales of almost $2 billion. Of that, 15% became net income. This stock is still not cheap but the best growth stories never are. I believe the Machine Internet is one of the big trends of this decade. You might also look to Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS), which is redesigning how chips are made for this new world.GE HealthCare (GEHC)GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comThe Machine Internet is becoming an Internet of Systems. A warehouse is a system. A factory is a system. A city is a system. A hospital is a system.GE Healthcare (NASDAQ:GEHC), which has just been spun out of General Electric (NYSE:GE), is going to help build this new systems Internet. GEHC is already a leader, alongside Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY), in producing the big scanners that are at the heart of hospitals today. These systems are now being used routinely. (I was tossed in one for a kidney stone last year.) There are innovations happening all the time. Lots of new machines mean lots of opportunities to build-in connectivity.GE, like me, has been betting on this Industrial Internet for decades and failing to see results from it. GE was way too early, it was too unfocused, and it was far too arrogant.Now it’s ready to deliver results, in the form of savings for hospitals and profits for GEHC. The GE breakup has created the humility necessary to move forward. The sunk cost of machines, and their necessary connections to patients and doctors, require these connections. It’s then a short step from scheduling the machines to the people.Right now, however. GE Healthcare isn’t priced like a growth stock. With a market cap of $29 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of just 15, it’s being priced like a value stock. The company estimates it will report $2.6 billion of earnings on $18.3 billion of revenue for all of 2022. I also like McKesson (NYSE:MCK), the hospital software company, here.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comIf I’m to place a bet on any of the Cloud Czars for 2022, it’s Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).First, because Amazon fell harder in 2022 than any other Czar not named Meta Platforms, the company is not broken. Amazon Web Services dominates in re-selling cloud, contributing nearly $5 billion of net income on revenue of $16 billion in the third quarter alone. Its media operations, Amazon Prime Video and Freevee, are set to dominate as streaming shakes out. The Kindle book operation and Fire TV already dominate their niches. Profits will grow, in contrast to its streaming rivals.There are two problem areas. First, the store needs to be run like a store, with its own CEO and a logistics expert below them. Right now Amazon’s store is being beaten by Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which copied most of Amazon’s innovations while adding in-store pick-up and local deliveries.The second problem is Alexa. Alexa won the voice control wars, but it doesn’t make any money so it can’t be sold. Its use cases are limited to music and cars. But there is an enormous user base for Alexa. It’s too big to kill. A lot of investors are put off by these problems, along with a PE of 87. But right now you’re paying barely two times the revenue for a stock that dominates its markets, including the world’s largest technology market.I’ll admit that I should have sold out of Amazon a year ago, taken my profits, and waited for the smoke of the tech wreck to clear. But if I have $100 in cash today, this is the first place I put it.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Fast Is UnitedHealth Group Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, UnitedHealth Group has grown EPS by 14% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It's noted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$324b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of UnitedHealth Group's forecast profits?Story continuesAre UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$455b company like UnitedHealth Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.5b. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add UnitedHealth Group To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, UnitedHealth Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group  that you should be aware of.Although UnitedHealth Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

161,d9e1fa3d-1585-37f6-83ab-af185a998ca8,AAL,2023-01-23,3 Airline Stocks to Sell to Avoid the Choppy Skies,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-airline-stocks-sell-avoid-131622531.html,1674134182,STORY,"['ALGT', 'AAL', 'SAVE']","[After a summer of labor disputes and a winter storm that forced cancellations from sea to shining sea, investors were finally beginning to believe that long positions in airline stocks were ready to take off. However, last week’s grounding of all U.S. flights is a reminder that all is not well in the airline industry. Although the issue at hand was not airline-specific, it still points out the thin line between profit and loss in this sector. But that’s not the only reason there are several airline stocks to sell to start off 2023. Earnings will be a key story to watch. Airlines are still facing a stubborn mix of increased headwinds and rising operating costs. That means that earnings are likely to remain under pressure. And as the FAA glitch makes clear, it wouldn’t take much to cause the airlines major headaches. Thus, now may be the time to look for airlines with solid balance sheets. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, here are three airline stocks to sell for those concerned about fundamental weakness in this sector.AALAmerican Airlines$16.64ALGTAllegiant Travel Company$79.99SAVESpirit Airlines$20.80American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flightsSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comFirst up on my list of airlines stocks to sell is American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). This may surprise some investors, because American recently raised its earnings guidance and the stock is trading at levels last seen around May 2022. I can appreciate that. But I’m not sure that it’s enough. American is facing a situation where revenue is now above pre-pandemic levels, but earnings have been slower to return. That’s not surprising, as airlines face rising operating costs. Those costs are likely to continue to rise, particularly if the cost of jet fuel rises, as expected. This is a time when a company’s balance sheet will matter a lot and American’s could use a little help. Plus, the recent run-up in AAL stock is putting the stock near the consensus target of analysts. And even though the stock is getting positive ratings from analysts, the consensus target suggests most growth may be already priced in as the company heads into its earnings call on January 19. Expect volatility with this stock over the next few days.Story continuesAllegiant Travel Company (ALGT) An Allegiant Air (ALGT) Airbus A319 lands at a Los Angeles, California airport.Source: Angel DiBilio / Shutterstock.comAnalyst ratings are not the be-all and end-all for a stock. But at a time when many economists remain convinced of an earnings recession, if not an actual recession, they may matter more than usual.Since the beginning of the year, Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ:ALGT) has received three negative reports from analysts. The most damaging was from Susquehanna, whose analysts lowered this company’s overall rating from Positive to Neutral, with a $90 price target. That’s still about a 12% increase from the current price, but with the stock down 58% in the last 12 months, it may not be enough. Like American Airlines, the low-cost airline is facing the issue of seeing its revenue surpass pre-pandemic levels at a time when inflation is raising the company’s operating costs. That’s hitting the company’s earnings. The average analyst earnings estimate for Allegiant in 2023 is $6.16. That would be well below 2019 levels. These stark analyst warnings don’t give investors much reason to hold onto ALGT stock, particularly if the economy does tip into recession.Spirit Airlines (SAVE)A yellow, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) branded airplane flying in the airSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comThe last of my three airline stocks to sell is Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). Plenty of enthusiasm surrounded SAVE stock after shareholders approved the airline’s merger with JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU). If the merger is approved by U.S. regulators, the combined airline will be the fifth-largest airline by revenue and have a market share of 10.2%.Investors were already concerned that regulators would veto the merger. And now, the airline faces a new antitrust lawsuit that could foil this combination altogether. All of this turmoil is showing up in the recent performance of SAVE stock price. At the time of writing, SAVE stock is sitting at $20.80. Analysts have a consensus price target of $27.29 for the stock. Accordingly, this means that JetBlue is paying a premium, right? I’m not an expert in merger arbitrage. And the $400 million breakup fee in addition to a 10 cent per month “ticking fee” may be enough to entice investors. But with the stock down 19% since the merger announcement, it seems that investors are considering the opportunity cost and deciding there are better options out there. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.
