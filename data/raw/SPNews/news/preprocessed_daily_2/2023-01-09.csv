(NASDAQ:VRSK). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Verisk Analytics’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics Is Verisk Analytics Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Verisk Analytics’s ratio of 27.64x is above its peer average of 21.03x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Professional Services industry. Another thing to keep in mind is that Verisk Analytics’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.Can we expect growth from Verisk Analytics?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Verisk Analytics, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe VRSK is currently trading above its peers, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSK for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its industry peers, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?If you'd like to know more about Verisk Analytics as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. For example, we've found that Verisk Analytics has 4 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you are no longer interested in Verisk Analytics, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Visit us at www.acuitybrands.comNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis news release includes the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") financial measures: “adjusted operating profit” and “adjusted operating profit margin” for total company and by segment; “adjusted net income;” “adjusted diluted EPS;” “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”);” “adjusted EBITDA;” and “free cash flow” (“FCF”)”. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the reader's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by excluding or adjusting items for amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, loss on sale of business, and special charges associated with continued efforts to streamline the organization and integrate recent acquisitions. FCF is provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of the Company’s ability to generate additional cash from its business. Management typically adjusts for these items for internal reviews of performance and uses the above non-GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision making, and other activities. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company’s results of operations as well as comparability with many of its peers, especially those companies focused more on technology and software. Non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP.The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin for total company and by segment are “operating profit” and “operating profit margin,” respectively, for total company and by segment, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, and special charges. Adjusted operating profit margin is adjusted operating profit divided by net sales for total company and by segment. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are “net income” and “diluted EPS,” respectively, which include the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets, loss on sale of business, share-based payment expense, and special charges. Adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for FCF is “net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment.” The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA is “net income”, which includes the impact of net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, special charges, and miscellaneous (income) expense, net. A reconciliation of each measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in this news release. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of such measures, which may include adjustments to exclude unusual or non-recurring items, should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other unusual or non-recurring items.Forward-Looking InformationThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations with over 1,000 tenants, today announced that it was recognized by Silicon Valley Bank in its ""Healthcare Investments and Exits: Annual Report 2022"" as the #1 most active corporate investor in biopharma by new deal volume (2021–2022) for the sixth consecutive year. This important distinction demonstrates Alexandria's position as a key leader and trusted partner within the life science industry.

In the face of this staggering unmet medical need, advancing new and improved therapies and cures is a national imperative,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and founder and head of Alexandria Venture Investments. ""Everyone will encounter health challenges during their lifetime and shoulder the cost and provision of care for loved ones as they navigate dementia, mental illness, cancer, or cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and other harrowing diseases and disorders.

Today, longtime Alexandria tenant Alnylam is the leading RNAi therapeutics company, having successfully translated Nobel Prize-winning science into multiple commercial therapeutic products benefiting patients around the world. In 2012, shortly after Moderna was founded, Alexandria identified the transformative potential of the company's pioneering mRNA platform. Alexandria has both invested in and provided Moderna with mission-critical real estate over the past decade. Now a world-leader in mRNA therapeutics and vaccines, Moderna has over 20 non-COVID-related products in clinical development in addition to its COVID-19 vaccines.Innovative medicines are essential for preventing, treating and curing disease and a key solution for driving down overall healthcare costs. The life science industry's pursuit of new, precise and more effective medicines, including complex modalities such as cell, gene and RNA-based therapies, represents a significant growth opportunity for the industry. Alexandria's proactive and disciplined venture investment activity remains vital to catalyzing the next generation of groundbreaking therapeutic platforms with immense potential to address a wide array of diseases, and ultimately fulfilling its mission to advance human health by curing disease and improving nutrition.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at PVH (NYSE:PVH), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for PVH, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.087 = US$753m ÷ (US$11b - US$2.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, PVH has an ROCE of 8.7%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 18%. See our latest analysis for PVH roceIn the above chart we have measured PVH's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PVH.What Does the ROCE Trend For PVH Tell Us?Over the past five years, PVH's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect PVH to be a multi-bagger going forward.Our Take On PVH's ROCEIn summary, PVH isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has declined 44% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think PVH has the makings of a multi-bagger.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing PVH, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go to 5 Biggest Non-Tech Companies in the World by Market Cap.Easy monetary policies, tech revolution, disposable income and societal changes after the coronavirus pandemic injected a euphoria-like optimism in the technology industry, causing a dramatic rise in tech stock valuations. During the summer of 2020, six major tech companies — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Tesla — accounted for about half of the total value of the NASDAQ 100 index. Trends like work-from-home, internet streaming, online gaming, media and entertainment fueled the growth of tech companies. However, all this optimism around tech and growth stocks came crashing down in 2022 as inflation started to go through the roof and the Federal Reserve decided to begin belt tightening. Major tech companies that were betting big on future technologies like metaverse, AI, machine learning and robotics failed to woo investors and saw billions of dollars erased from their market value as investors flocked to value plays. Major growth investors like Cathie Wood suffered huge losses that are expected to continue this year.Technology companies have now started to lay off employees and cut costs as warning calls for a recession in 2023 grow. According to a layoffs tracking website, there were about 150,000 jobs cuts in the tech industry in 2022. That’s despite the fact that the labor market remained strong in the year. Tech companies are expected to increase the number of layoffs as these firms run out of safety nets. Meta Platforms announced over 11,000 layoffs in November. In the same month, Amazon, which has a reputation of being a major tech recruiter, began its biggest layoff initiative in its 28-year history. This layoff plan is expected to affect about 10,000 employees.Tech companies are expected to remain under pressure until the economy comes back to its normal trajectory.Story continuesPixabay/Public Domain Our MethodologyAs investors look beyond tech stocks and try to find old-school, non-tech companies operating in a diverse range of sectors, we decided to give our readers a basic rundown of some of the biggest non-tech companies in the world. For this article we used stock screeners and manual search to list down the biggest companies in the world outside of the technology industry.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Unfortunately the Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) share price slid 34% over twelve months. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 18%. Even if shareholders bought some time ago, they wouldn't be particularly happy: the stock is down 28% in three years.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Equity Residential While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the Equity Residential share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Equity Residential's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. From what we can see, revenue is pretty flat, so that doesn't really explain the share price drop. Of course, it could simply be that it simply fell short of the market consensus expectations.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthEquity Residential is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Equity Residential in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Equity Residential the TSR over the last 1 year was -31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Equity Residential shareholders are down 31% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 18%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Equity Residential has   4 warning signs  (and 2 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.But note: Equity Residential may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Talent,Hart Energy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/real-shortage-facing-oil-gas-051400921.html,1673241240,STORY,['CL=F'],"[The roots of oil and gas’ looming talent challenge began with the end of the World War II. Returning GIs anxious to start a new life began getting married and having kids, lots of kids. An estimated 78 million baby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. They began retiring in 2011 and most will be done by 2029.Oil and gas had managed to put off the so-called “Great Crew Change” for a time because equity values were “crushed” between 2014 and 2020, said Les Csorba, partner in the Houston office of executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles. But no longer. Oil and gas is now one of the best performing equity classes, and rising stock prices means the sector is seeing more retirements, Csorba said.To be sure, the pandemic has also played a role, accelerating the pace of retirements for older workers.“Companies are worried about retirements over the next year to 18 months across the C-suite,” Csorba told Hart Energy. Succession planning is becoming a real issue as oil and gas enterprises wrestle with how to replace experienced senior managers with younger, less experienced workers.It’s for that reason that Csorba, along with his colleague Clayton Spears, produced the recent report “The next energy crisis? Talent.”Chuck Yates. (Source: Hart Energy)Replacing those retirees is made more complicated by factors specific to oil and gas.“There’s a huge gap in middle management,” said Csorba. Previous downturns forced layoffs that pushed talent from the sector, as well as growing anti-hydrocarbon rhetoric that has tamped down interest in oil and gas careers.The true scale of the problem has been masked to a degree by private-equity investment in the sector between 1997 and 2017, said Chuck Yates, a former managing partner at Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors. Such investment created opportunities for young executives to gain experience as part of a startup management team and create the potential for significant rewards, he said.Private equity’s decreased prevalence shrinks those opportunities for young talent, Yates told Hart Energy. Meanwhile the current state of the market scares off potential new entrants because it creates “unlimited downside and limited upside,” he said.Story continuesYates himself lost his job at Kayne Anderson in 2020 and is now a self-proclaimed “social media influencer” through his podcast, “Chuck Yates Needs a Job.”Start at the topThe scale of the oil and gas talent problem is so large that it demands board-level involvement, similar to ESG risks, said Csorba. Companies might consider creating reports to demonstrate the sustainability of their talent pipeline.“I would argue that leadership and succession planning and talent is also a material risk to the longevity of a business,” said Csorba.Csorba and colleague Spears suggests companies should report on: efforts to develop, recruit and retain the next generation of leaders; leadership initiatives, academies, coaching and mentoring programs; C-level executives of the future programs; and whether external leaders are being recruited to continually reinvigorate leadership, innovation and diversity of experience.Csorba said chief human resources officers (CHROs) may play a strategic role in such efforts. Just as a CFO and head of audit work closely with audit committee chairs, CHROs should more actively report to and participate in nominating and governance committee meetings on boards and be accountable alongside the CEO for the company's leadership strategy.Such executives should probably be reporting quarterly to the board of directors and be more involved in executive compensation. The board’s key responsibility, after all, is to hire and fire the CEO, he said.Boards should hold management teams more accountable for rigorous talent acquisition and leadership development programs, Csorba and Spears said, and maybe consider making this metric a part of executive compensation plans.“Boards really ought to be focused on that,” said Yates, adding that talent management is “business 101.”The directors’ role is not necessarily to tell companies what to do, but rather to provide guidance on what not to do, he said. They should also ask questions. The board should get answers to basic questions such as the company’s recruiting plan, how many people are needed, the average cost when an employee leaves and what happens if something were to occur to senior management, Yates said.Yates sits on the board of directors of Black Mountain Acquisition Corp., a Fort Worth, Texas-based special purpose acquisition company focused on opportunities in the energy industry in North America led by CEO Rhett Bennett. Yates is also on the advisory board of Montrose Lane, a venture capital firm focused on digital solutions for the energy industry, and a “big brother” to the founders of Digital Wildcatters, a social media company focused on energy.Needs assessmentWhen considering how to develop future leaders, Csorba and Spears said that energy executives must move away from being specialists and look to become more like decathletes, who are proficient in many areas. Those include financial performance, investor confidence, innovation, social or people or safety leadership, environmental stewardship, reputation and risk and resilience.Executives are shouldering new demands that didn’t exist previously. Expectations include increased disclosure and transparency regarding ESG factors to investors and analysts, more aggressive shareholder activist campaigns and the ever-rising importance of technology.Technology holds a stark duality, Csorba said. Leveraging big data offers great potential, for instance, in aiding decision-making on proper well spacing or other operational matters.But greater reliance on technology exposes companies to cybersecurity risks, as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware hack demonstrated. Future leaders will need to balance that risk/reward. For that reason, some companies look to have generational diversity within executive teams and boards to enhance their digital expertise.Despite the technical sophistication of oil and gas when it comes to applying technology to solving large problems, such as using 3D seismic to make massive new oil finds, the industry does less well in using technology to run more efficient businesses, Yates said. He points to the large amount of written ledgers and actual paperwork in the sector that does not help when recruiting younger talent who grew up using apps on their phone.Other applications of technology likely going underutilized in oil and gas include those focused on employee health and mental wellbeing, said Yates.“If I have employees that are at the top of their game, particularly with mental health, I'm going to get better performance,” he said. Other sectors have invested significant effort into using technology to deliver those offerings, Yates said.US Oil and Gas Employment by Age Group. (Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics)Think outside the sandboxNot all the hurdles oil and gas companies face are negative.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the industry meets more than 81% of current global energy demand and will only see moderate declines in the future. Hydrocarbon market share is only expected to drop to 78% over the next 20 years as overall worldwide energy demand is expected to grow by as much as 50% by 2050, IEA estimates show.That means oil and gas companies must not only develop leaders who can meet existing requirements efficiently and profitably but also do so in an environment of rising demand. Csorba and Spears said that future leaders may benefit from looking outside the oil and gas sector for potential solutions in related industries.  Specifically, they see the potential for cross-pollination between oil and gas and renewables. They share much in common, not the least of which is powering all other industries and contributing to the flourishing of human civilization.Renewables is one of the fastest growing portions of the energy sector, averaging 15% CAGR between 2015 and 2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Although renewables are often held up in opposition to oil and gas, the truth is addressing the energy supply challenge will require maximum effort by both sectors, Csorba and Spears said.Renewables’ fast growth has created a need to “get creative” to get bodies in the door, said Spears, who focuses on the sector for Heidrick &amp; Struggles. One approach is to appeal to the mission-driven concerns of younger generations by focusing on sustainability and benefits to the environment to attract new leaders. The renewables sector leads with their mission, not profits, he said.In many ways, the oil and gas industry has “stuck its head in the sand for 50 years” when it comes to marketing its value to the world, said Yates. Part of the problem he attributed to the fact that oil and gas does not have a culture of marketing because it sells a commodity. Nevertheless, the sector needs to demonstrate its thought leadership and better control its narrative, Yates said. “Cleaner and greener” is important to oil and gas to fill the pipeline for talent, Spears said. Large upstream players have already begun the pivot by highlighting their investments in new energy segments, he noted.Oil and gas executives need diverse skill set. (Source: Shutterstock)Last March, Exxon Mobil Corp. announced plans to build a 1 Bcf/d hydrogen production plant in Baytown, Texas, as well as carbon capture facilities to handle up to 10 million metric tons (MMmt) of CO₂ per year. In December 2022, Chevron Corp. announced a joint venture with Baseload Capital to develop geothermal projects in the U.S. Last March, Occidental Petroleum Corp. disclosed efforts to build 70 carbon capture facilities by 2035 to remove 1 MMmt of CO₂ per year directly from the air.Csorba also pointed out oil and gas services companies such as National Oilwell Varco and Kirby Corp. are announcing plans to provide support for the burgeoning offshore wind power industry.While oil and gas can learn from renewables, it has much to offer itself from an operational perspective, particularly in terms of operational, regulatory and safety matters, said Csorba. Those are important, as renewables have a very large scalability challenge ahead of it, he said. Closer collaboration stands to benefit both segments, said Yates.In the future, Yates expects companies to focus more on delivering a diversified slate of energy offerings. That means companies will be less focused on energy type and more concentrated on geographic position. For instance, West Texas not only has world-class oil and gas reserves but also generates a record amount of solar and wind power.Regardless of the particulars, the large-scale trends are clear. Oil and gas, along with the rest of the energy sector, has a bright outlook but must take steps today to avoid creating a crisis in the future.]"

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Flowserve’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Flowserve What's The Opportunity In Flowserve?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.25% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Flowserve today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $27.82, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Flowserve’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Flowserve look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Flowserve's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FLS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FLS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global power dynamics and go directly to the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World Heading Into 2023. People often think of a country’s military when it comes to its power and while it's true that military strength translates to raw power, there are many other dimensions of power as well that are required to capture its overall nuance. Economic strength is the second most important form of power in general and perhaps the most important form in our current world. Other dimensions include political power like close international alliances and diplomatic leverage.Finally, there is something called soft power in terms of international relations, it is the ability of a country to attract other countries rather than coerce them to its own preferences. This is primarily achieved through cultural influence. However, at the risk of sounding redundant, economic power is the most important form of power in the global power dynamics, despite military capability being the most raw form of power. Is Military Strength Becoming Less Relevant?Wars are increasingly becoming too impractical to win because the majority of modern wars are unconventional, where the adversary is usually overthrown quickly by a superior military. But for all intents and purposes, it leads the former to disperse, mix up with the local civilian population and mount an insurgency, which has been described as effectively undefeatable. However, despite war going out of fashion, with the exception of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, countries maintain militaries for the secondary purpose of deterrence. In this sense, military strength is still highly relevant, albeit superseded by economic power. Why Economic Power Defines the 21st CenturyEconomic strength has fast become the most important form of power in the 21st century, primarily due to the fact that the majority of countries’ economies have become market-driven following globalization. Trade liberalization has grown by an average of 8% since the past decade across the world. This has led to about 130 countries economically prospering over the same time period. Story continuesThe Capitalist Peace theory asserts that countries with mutual business interests established through economic liberalization are unlikely to go to war with each other. Although the evidence to support the theory remains inconclusive according to political scientist Erik Gartzke, they contend that countries with lower levels of market freedom are 14 times more likely to go to war than countries with higher levels.  A multivariate regression has also found a statistically-significant negative correlation between military spending and economic growth, which further supports the conclusions of Capitalist Peace theory. Moreover, economic might has also come in handy in terms of geopolitical tensions, further taking space from military solutions. For instance, The Drexel Researchers have concluded that economic sanctions lead to 55% achievement (complete, partial and negotiated) of geopolitical objectives. One of the most recent complete-successes resulting from the threat of US-led sanctions came in 1993, when president of Guatemala Jorge Serrano dissolved congress and announced his autocracy. The US and the EU threatened sanctions against the country, leading to business forces in Guatemala taking Serrano out of power. The looming threat of sanctions cost the country 1.3% of its GDP. A typical example of sanctions is the US simply prohibiting its corporations from doing business in the target country. Considering the size of the global US companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), such sanctions can significantly affect the target economy.Soft PowerDiplomacy is often regarded as the core element in the political power of a country. Diplomacy, along with cultural influence, form the bedrock of a country’s soft power. In this regard, countries like the US, UK and Japan hold enviable power. This form of power has led countries like the US to bring other countries together for common causes. Soft power also helps countries better their perception in other countries, leading to immigration and tourism. With factors of power established, let’s move to the 23 most powerful countries in the world heading into 2023.23 Most Powerful Countries in the World Heading Into 2023Pixabay/Public domainOur MethodologyFor our list, we’ve ranked the countries based on military, economic, political and cultural power. We’ve covered countries’ military, economic, cultural and political power here, here, here and here, respectively, with more than top 20 countries in each domain. We have averaged out the rankings of countries based on these dimensions of power for the list of most powerful countries in the world heading into 2023. Countries that have more rankings in our aforementioned lists have been ranked higher, even if they ranked lower on individual factors of power. However, countries with fewer rankings, that ranked significantly higher in the aggregate results of their respective categories, have been pushed closer to the top. Let’s dive in. 23. AustriaPolitical-Influence Ranking: 24 GNI Per Capita Ranking: 19Austria is situated in the Southern part of Central Europe. Apart from being a member of the EU, which grants it considerable political influence in Europe, Austria is also one of the richest countries on the continent, with a Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita of $58,370 as of 2022. Austria is not a NATO member but maintains a close relationship with the military alliance. The country is above average in terms of military strength according to Global Firepower, which ranks it in 84th position out of 145 countries. 22. TurkeyPolitical-Influence Ranking: 22 Military-Strength Ranking: 14Turkey is one of the most powerful countries in the world, owing primarily to its political influence and military strength. It is also considered the 8th most advanced country in Asia based on human development and R&amp;D investment. Turkey’s memberships in NATO and the G20 make it geopolitically and geoeconomically formidable. 21. IsraelPolitical-Influence Ranking: 11 Military-Strength Ranking: 13Israel is the most technologically advanced country in the Middle East. Due to geopolitical tensions, territorial disputes and low strategic depth, Israel has invested in a sophisticated proactive military that protects its borders, ports and airspace.While countries around the world have mixed opinions about Israel, it ranks high in political capital due to its influence, mainly over the United States, which is the result of mutual strategic dependence and extensive lobbying on Israel’s part. 20. Saudi ArabiaPolitical-Influence Ranking: 14 Military-Strength Ranking: 10Saudi Arabia is the biggest economy in the Middle East, with a 2022 GDP of $1 trillion. It ranks in the top 10 in terms of military strength, due to the country dramatically increasing military spending in the wake of its involvement in the Yemen war. In 2021, the country ranked eighth in terms of military spending, with a defense budget of $56 billion. The figure accounted for 2.6% of global military spending for the year. However, Saudi Arabia’ greatest power comes from its oil-production capacity. Its 2021 oil production was 11% of the global output. On top of that, Saudi Arabia is also the leading member of OPEC. These factors allow the country to hold considerable sway over the global energy market as well as geopolitics. 19. BrazilPolitical-Influence Ranking: 23 Military-Strength Ranking: 20 Cultural-Influence Ranking: 15Brazil is the biggest country in Latin America in terms of landmass, population and economy.

Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Archer-Daniels-Midland's (NYSE:ADM) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Archer-Daniels-Midland, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$58b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.

The employment rate remains one percentage point below its pre-Covid level.Story continuesMany experts believe this is because of more people retiring early and lengthy NHS waiting lists which are preventing people from returning to work.The US also struggles with labour shortages but this likely is driven by a strong economic bounce back after the pandemic, which has not been as pronounced in the UK, Mr Pill said.He added: “The distinctive context that prevails in the UK – of higher natural gas prices with a tight labour market, adverse labour supply developments and goods market bottlenecks – creates the potential for inflation to prove more persistent.”It signals that rate-setters on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee may have to go further to cool price growth even with the labour market slowing.However, Mr Pill also suggested that there were already signs that the jobs market was cooling, as fewer companies advertise for staff. The Bank believes a million more people will be unemployed by the end of 2025 if interest rates continue to rise.“We are starting to see labour market indicators turn,” he said. “Should economic slack emerge and unemployment rise as the latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) forecasts imply, that will weigh against domestic inflationary pressure and ease the threat of inflation persistence.”06:21 PMThat's all for todayHere are today's top stories:Sturgeon and Burnham plot £3bn raid on Westminster to connect HS2 to ScotlandApple follows Mark Zuckerberg into the metaverse with plan to launch VR headsetElectric car battery maker Britishvolt in sale talksVirgin Orbit to deliver UK's maiden rocket launch: everything you need to knowBritain is too late to the space race – it risks becoming a bubble06:12 PMSturgeon and Burnham hold talks for £3bn HS2 extensionNicola Sturgeon and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham are planning to try to force ministers to spend £3bn on extending HS2 to run to Scotland, The Telegraph's chief business correspondent Oliver Gill can reveal.Ministers last summer mothballed a section of HS2 that would have allowed Scotland to benefit from the high-speed rail link.However, The Telegraph can reveal that Sturgeon and Burnham held secret talks aimed at forcing ministers to spend £3bn to connect the rail link to the north of the border.The 13-mile “Golborne Link” near Manchester – designed to connect the new HS2 with the existing west coast main line that runs north to Glasgow and Edinburgh – was axed last year as the UK looked for cost-savings amid a ballooning budget deficit.Axing the Golborne Link will save the Government £3bn but was widely seen as eradicating hopes that Scotland would benefit from HS2.Read the full story here05:54 PMDonald Trump’s Scottish golf courses miss deadline to file accountsDonald Trump’s Scottish golf courses have been given more time to file accounts after missing the statutory deadline.It comes as the former US president and golf fanatic battles a scandal engulfing his American tax returns.A spokesman for Mr Trump’s three Scottish golf courses insisted that the UK officials had granted the businesses extra time to file financial statements for 2021.“A standard extension was granted for the submission of our 2021 company accounts,” they said.Mr Trump's Scottish golf interests include Turnberry on the east coast in Ayrshire and the Trump International in Aberdeenshire.Former President Donald Trump hits off of the first tee during the Pro-Am tournament before the LIV Golf series - USA TodayOliver Gill has the full story05:50 PMChip shortage for carmakers coming to an endSilicon chip shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic are coming to an end, Jaguar Land Rover has said.

The review added Meta risked harming political speech and human rights by taking down such forms of protest.04:58 PMTesla shares leap as US markets openShares in Tesla jumped nearly 8pc in trading in the US as markets react to signals that demand in China has picked up after a months long slump in the electric car maker.Tesla has been battling to boost demand in China, which accounts for around a third of all its sales, against challengers such as local electric carmaker BYD.

This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 2.1%, and is in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.6%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of GHYAX over the past three years is 10.44% compared to the category average of 15.81%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 8.32% compared to the category average of 13.69%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.GHYAX carries a beta of 0.94, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a positive alpha of 0.76, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.RatingsHowever, it is worth noting that 35 % of the bonds in this fund are not ranked, so take the average quality level with a bit of caution.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, GHYAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.85% compared to the category average of 0.79%. GHYAX is actually more expensive than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Story continuesThis fund requires a minimum initial investment of $1,000, and each subsequent investment should be at least $50.Bottom LineOverall, Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A ( GHYAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, better downside risk, and higher fees, Goldman Sachs High Yield Municipals A ( GHYAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Bond area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Improving ProfitsIn the last three years Schlumberger's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Impressively, Schlumberger's EPS catapulted from US$1.18 to US$2.10, over the last year. Year on year growth of 77% is certainly a sight to behold.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Schlumberger shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 11% to 14%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Schlumberger?Story continuesAre Schlumberger Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Schlumberger, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$140m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Schlumberger Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Schlumberger's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Schlumberger for a spot on your watchlist. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for Schlumberger that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today preliminary revenue results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022.The Company expects to report total revenues of approximately $1,074.2 million, a decrease of (27.0%) compared to the prior year period, or (25.1%) in constant currency. These preliminary results are higher than the Company’s most recent revenue guidance range of $940 to $990 million, which was provided on October 31, 2022.""We delivered robust revenue performance in our fiscal first quarter of 2023, with our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses growing organically double-digits in constant currency, excluding COVID,"" said Steve MacMillan, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

However, the Company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 provided on October 31, 2022.Story continuesHologic intends to provide its full financial results for the first quarter on February 1, 2023. Until that time, the preliminary revenue results described in this press release are estimates only and are subject to revisions that could differ materially. When the Company reports its first quarter results, it also expects to provide updated financial guidance for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2023, following the completion of its quarterly forecasting process.J.P. Morgan Healthcare ConferenceHologic is providing these updates in advance of its participation in the 41st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, which begins tomorrow. The Company will post its conference presentation to the investors section of its website at http://investors.hologic.com/. A live webcast of the Company’s presentation and question and answer session, which begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 10, 2023, also may be accessed there. The webcast will be available for 30 days.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID, and non-GAAP EPS. Organic revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 excludes the divested Blood Screening business, as well as the acquired Bolder business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID assay revenue, COVID related sales of instruments, COVID related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, collection kits and ancillaries, as well as license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products. The Company defines its non-GAAP EPS and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and equipment; (ii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iii) additional expenses resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) restructuring and divestiture charges and facility closure and consolidation charges, including accelerated depreciation, and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services) and separate divested businesses from existing operations; (v) expenses related to the divested Cynosure business incurred subsequent to the disposition date primarily related to indemnification provisions for legal and tax matters; (vi) transaction related expenses for divestitures and acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to implementing the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments.Because the quarterly financial information contained in this press release is preliminary, it is deemed to be forward-looking. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of preliminary organic revenue and preliminary organic revenue excluding COVID to preliminary or projected GAAP revenue because of the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations at this time. The Company is also unable to provide GAAP EPS in this press release because certain significant items have not yet been finalized. Such items depend on various factors and could have a material impact on reported GAAP EPS. GAAP results and a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure will be presented in connection with the Company’s press release reporting full financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 scheduled to be released after the close of the market on February 1, 2023. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results and comparison to competitors' operating results. Non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures (when they become available), may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review, when they become available, the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.About Hologic, Inc.Hologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment.

48,99397582-bed2-3c05-bb47-ea2223611e5f,NFLX,2023-01-09,The End of the Netflix-ization of TV and the Beginning of a New Streaming Bundle,WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/99397582-bed2-3c05-bb47-ea2223611e5f/the-end-of-the.html,1673257860,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[This year may mark the end of the Netflix-ization of that thing we used to call television. The clamor to meet consumers where they are — on their phones and Apple TVs, but most definitely not in front of a television with a cable box and a bundle of linear channels — produced a streaming gold rush that was a boon for writers and directors (and famous people) who could get barely baked projects green-lit without so much as a pitch deck. The rush by legacy media brands to launch streaming platforms was accelerated during the pandemic lockdown of 2020.But with Wall Street no longer in thrall to a potential streaming gold rush that never really materialized, 2023 may be the year the media industry is finally forced to live within it means.More from WWD'The White Lotus' Season 2 Costumes for Jennifer Coolidge, Aubrey Plaza &amp; More'Wednesday' Costumes From Season 1 on Netflix: The Standout Styles'Emily in Paris' Season 3 Premiere Red Carpet Fetes Lily Collins, Ashley Park &amp; More StarsThe streaming wars — the term is something of a misnomer since Netflix won the war before it even commenced — birthed a plethora of new platforms and a glut of content. Much of it forgettable and more than the population of connected consumers could realistically consume. It spurred all manner of irrational exuberance on the part of content providers flush with subscriber cash and hungry for ever more “original” content to feed the digital maw. Lavish development deals rained down on reliable hit makers (Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy) and people who had never seen the inside of a development meeting (the Obamas, Harry and Meghan). Now, the economic headwinds (inflation, recession) are blowing home the roosting chickens.A spate of pre-holiday layoffs rocked the industry — thousands of rank-and-file employees have been pink-slipped, but so have lavishly paid executives, most famously Disney chief executive officer Bob Chapek, who was unceremoniously dumped in the wake of a disastrous earnings report and succeeded by his predecessor who handpicked him, Bob Iger.Story continuesWarner Bros. Discovery shuttered streaming service CNN+, has so far laid off more than 1,000 employees across the company, canceled shows and scratched movies (the completed $90 million “Batgirl”) in favor of write-downs as CEO David Zaslav — saddled with an eye-popping $50 billion in post-merger debt — has promised to find $3 billion in annual savings. Paramount Global nixed its Showtime streaming app, parting ways with veteran executive David Nevins and CBS Entertainment chief Kelly Kahl, while enacting layoffs in multiple departments including marketing and ad sales. Disney rolled out a range of cost-cutting measures including layoffs, hiring freezes and limits on company travel.At Netflix, which lost half its value in 2022 (compared to 17 percent for the S&amp;P 500), hundreds of employees were let go (mostly in the U.S.). Though it still plans to spend about $17 billion annually on content, roughly what it has shelled out in recent years, late last year Netflix launched a lower priced ad-supported tier, after years of mocking the industry standard ad-dollar imperative. (Disney+ also launched an ad-supported tier while Peacock launched as an advertising-based video on demand, or AVOD, service, and Hulu, Paramount+ and HBO Max have all previously offered both ad-supported and premium tiers.)For consumers, the industry’s annus horribilis will mean less content — though viewers will be excused for not noticing. This is not necessarily deleterious if development executives are forced to focus on quality over quantity. (Would Zaslav have canceled HBO’s “Westworld,” shocking the show’s staff and angering fans, if he had less bad TV on its books?)This shift will not take hold everywhere. Amazon — which has the biggest inventory of content with no discernible original content strategy — shows no signs of identifying a strategy. This is, after all, the company that spent $20 million on the well-meaning but middling reviewed documentary “Wildcat” — about an Afghanistan war veteran and an adorable baby ocelot — an enormous amount of money for a nature film. But Amazon will streamline spending, announcing 18,000 layoffs on Wednesday — deeper cuts than expected — in the company’s devices, books and stores divisions, which includes its main site, as well as field and warehouse operations. Apple TV+ will continue apace, though the service has always green-lit far fewer programs compared to its streaming competitors.With such stiff economic headwinds, 2023 likely portends the end of peak TV. The term was coined by FX chief John Landgraf at the dawn of a modern golden era for scripted television, especially hour-long dramas, but also half-hour dramedies. And while streamers are likely to still churn out reality TV and low-budget unscripted content, there will be much more budget scrutiny when it comes to big-ticket scripted programming. “[2022] will mark the peak of the peak TV era,” predicted Landgraf during a conference call with reporters at the semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour last summer.According to the FX Research department, 357 scripted series launched in the first half of 2022, an increase of 16 percent year-over-year. But post-Netflix stock swoon — which happened in April 2022 — the industry is very clearly in retrench mode. During the second half of 2022, the number of commissioned scripted series in the U.S. declined by 24 percent year-over-year, according to U.K.-based research firm Ampere Analysis. The companies that slashed scripted commissions the most were Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global.The saturated streaming market that led to subscriber losses or sluggish growth and is overwhelming consumers with too much content and too many services is also spurring a demand for a streaming bundle that offers consumers the kind of one-stop shopping that the antiquated cable bundle delivered. According to a recent survey from e-commerce data firm Bango, 72 percent of U.S. subscription video on demand (SVOD) respondents said there are “too many subscription services,” while close to 80 percent said they want a single platform to manage all of their subscriptions. As if on cue, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed on Dec. 6 that HBO Max would once again be available on Prime video channels in the U.S.Paramount+, Starz, AMC+ and Hulu also are available on Prime, for a fee. Netflix and Disney+ are not; they don’t need to be. Disney+ reported subscriber growth to 164.2 million for the final quarter of the 2022 fiscal year; across its combined intracompany streaming bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+, the company finished the year with 235.7 million global subscribers, surpassing Netflix’s 223 million.But for smaller services, a bundled approach may be the only way to realize scale in a saturated market. Paramount CEO Bob Bakish has been bullish on the bundle. Paramount+ reported 46 million global subscribers for the third quarter of 2022, rising to 67 million when its other streaming services (including the CBS News streaming service CBSN and CBS Sports HQ) are included.There are impediments to a global bundle that includes competing services — lower revenue and control of a user interface among them. But with economic headwinds continuing to swirl in 2023, the new streaming could begin to look a lot like the old TV.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Medicine. The recent pandemic was the best reflection of the advancements in the field of medicine. Vaccines were developed at a lightning-fast pace, with the first vaccine for Covid-19 approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only a year after the outbreak. It was developed by a joint effort of two of the most advanced pharmaceutical companies when it comes to R&amp;D - Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The former is an American company while the latter is German.Other top pharma companies include names like Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN).Due to the medicine industry’s role in the improvement of human well-being, it leads to GDP growth through labor productivity and personal spending. The correlation coefficients for this are demonstrable.  The US, Switzerland and Norway are some of the most advanced countries when it comes to the field of medicine, with huge healthcare spending, numerous pharmaceutical companies and sophisticated academia.OutlookMedicine is one of the fastest growing fields in the world. It encompasses the pharmaceutical industry, medical schools and hospitals. The demand for healthcare is expected to increase due to a variety of factors, such as an aging population and advances in medical technology. According to the Pharma Outlook 2030 by KPMG, many trends are shaping the pharma industry for 2030. For instance, the free-for-service payment model is increasingly being challenged by the end-users, hospitals and insurance agencies. They want the pricing model to be designed around the success and the quality of the product. One of the most prominent results of this is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI)’s 2016 value-based contracts with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) for cholesterol drugs, with the insurance agencies receiving discounts if their therapies do not reduce cholesterol levels enough. Story continuesAdvances in big data and machine learning are also likely to allow for the pre-emptive measures against the onset of diseases instead of just treating them. Further, machine learning is also set to play a pivotal role in drug discovery.A recent example is the AlphaFold, a deep learning model by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s subsidiary - DeepMind. It has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, an important leap in drug discovery. Priorly, it had been a challenge that had puzzled molecular biologists for half a century. Major advances are primarily happening on the academic front of medicine, and AI in the field is pervasive. For instance, Harvard University researchers have come up with an automated cancer detection system, which uses AI to find breast cancer by examining lymph node cells. Given the trends, AI is largely going to be an integral field to medicine. Another field that is likely to augment the pharma industry by 2030 is nanotechnology. In this regard, Novartis, in partnership with Proteus, has developed a smart pill that can be swallowed for diagnostics purposes. The pharmaceutical manufacturing market is one of the fastest growing in the world. It was worth $358 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a valuation of $1.2 trillion by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 13%, as reported by Precedence Research.On the other hand, the drug-discovery industry was valued at $75 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 9%, to $162 billion in 2030.Lastly, the hospital industry is projected to be valued at $2 trillion by 2028, after a growth with a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period of 2021-2028. It was valued at $820 billion in 2021.Let’s now move to the 15 most advanced countries in medicine. 15 Most Advanced Countries in MedicinePhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur Methodology For our list of the most advanced nations in medicine, we’ve ranked them based on three reports. These are the following - Legatum Prosperity Index, 2021, Countries’ Citations in Clinical Medicine, by Institute of Scientific Information, and the CEO-World report of the countries with the best healthcare systems in 2021. Legatum Prosperity Index’s health ‘pillar’ measures the extent to which people have access to essential and advanced healthcare services. The Institute of Scientific Information report, on the other hand, is about the number of citations per paper for countries in the field of clinical medicine. Lastly, the CEO-World report is based on a statistical analysis that accounted for factors such as healthcare infrastructure, government readiness, healthcare professionals and quality of medicine among others. We’ve averaged out the rankings for the top countries in the three reports.

Readings for the previous two months were revised lower, while wage growth also eased.The reading eased fears that an overheated U.S. jobs market will prevent inflation from easing further this year, and pushed up expectations that the Federal Reserve will soften its hawkish stance sooner than expected, letting up pressure on gold and other non-yielding assets.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,868.61 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,873.15 an ounce by 19:35 ET (00:35 GMT). Both instruments were trading at their highest level since early-June, after rallying nearly 2% on Friday.The dollar softened further on Monday after reversing most of last week’s gains on the payrolls data, while 10-year Treasury yields also drifted lower.Focus now turns to U.S. consumer price index inflation data due on Thursday for more cues on the path of U.S. interest rates. CPI inflation is expected to have sunk to a one-year low in December, indicating that a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed in 2022 are having their intended effect.These rate hikes walloped gold prices last year, as they pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. But the yellow metal saw a resurgence in interest over the past month, with safe haven demand also coming back into play amid fears of a potential recession in 2023.The Fed is now expected to further slow its pace of interest rate hikes, with a majority of traders pricing in an only 25 basis point hike in February. But the central bank has warned that it could keep rates higher for longer.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated slightly on Monday, but hovered near a seven-month high after optimism over the reopening of China’s international borders triggered a sharp rally in the red metal.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.9588 a pound, coming off a 2.6% rally last week.Prices of the red metal shot up after China further eased anti-COVID measures this month, a move markets hope will trigger a quick economic rebound in the world’s largest copper importer.Related ArticlesGold prices rise to 7-month high as hawkish Fed fears ebbOil nudges higher after China opens borders, lifts fuel demand outlookEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

(NASDAQ:PDCO) will pay a dividend of $0.26 on the 3rd of February. The dividend yield will be 3.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies Patterson Companies' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Patterson Companies' earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 13.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 45% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendPatterson Companies Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.56 total annually to $1.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.4% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, Patterson Companies has only grown its earnings per share at 3.7% per annum over the past five years. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 3.7% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.Our Thoughts On Patterson Companies' DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Patterson Companies' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Readings for the previous two months were revised lower, while wage growth also eased.The reading eased fears that an overheated U.S. jobs market will prevent inflation from easing further this year, and pushed up expectations that the Federal Reserve will soften its hawkish stance sooner than expected, letting up pressure on gold and other non-yielding assets.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,868.61 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,873.15 an ounce by 19:35 ET (00:35 GMT). Both instruments were trading at their highest level since early-June, after rallying nearly 2% on Friday.The dollar softened further on Monday after reversing most of last week’s gains on the payrolls data, while 10-year Treasury yields also drifted lower.Focus now turns to U.S. consumer price index inflation data due on Thursday for more cues on the path of U.S. interest rates. CPI inflation is expected to have sunk to a one-year low in December, indicating that a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed in 2022 are having their intended effect.These rate hikes walloped gold prices last year, as they pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. But the yellow metal saw a resurgence in interest over the past month, with safe haven demand also coming back into play amid fears of a potential recession in 2023.The Fed is now expected to further slow its pace of interest rate hikes, with a majority of traders pricing in an only 25 basis point hike in February. But the central bank has warned that it could keep rates higher for longer.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated slightly on Monday, but hovered near a seven-month high after optimism over the reopening of China’s international borders triggered a sharp rally in the red metal.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.9588 a pound, coming off a 2.6% rally last week.Prices of the red metal shot up after China further eased anti-COVID measures this month, a move markets hope will trigger a quick economic rebound in the world’s largest copper importer.Related ArticlesGold prices rise to 7-month high as hawkish Fed fears ebbOil nudges higher after China opens borders, lifts fuel demand outlookEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

This is owed to the group’s relative stability when it comes to revenue and earnings, which also translates to their ability to pay dividends irrespective of economic conditions.But not all healthcare stocks are created equal. Let’s take a look at three that we like for attractive dividends today, as well as long-term growth potential. These stocks are good picks whether we have a recession in 2023 or not, as they should provide a diversifying component to an investor’s portfolio.PFEPfizer$49.12MDTMedtronic$80.90UNHUnitedHealth Group$490.93InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comOur first stock is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures and distributes a wide variety of medicines and vaccines. The company has a long slate of pharmaceuticals that treat, among others, cardiovascular, metabolic, Covid-19, pneumococcal disease, inflammatory disease, hemophilia, and endocrine diseases.Pfizer was founded in 1849. It should produce about $100 billion in revenue in 2022 and has a current market capitalization of $287 billion.Pfizer’s current dividend increase streak is 13 years. That isn’t among the longest streaks by any means, but it is long enough that the company has weathered a couple of weak economic periods and continued to raise the payout.The stock is yielding 3.2% today, which is roughly in line with its historical norms. That also puts it at about two times that of the S&amp;P 500, so Pfizer is a true income stock.What makes it all the more attractive is that the payout ratio is just 25% of this year’s earnings. That means the dividend is ultra-safe, even in the event of a harsh recession. Not only that, but it leaves ample room for future increases as well, as Pfizer’s research and development (R&amp;D) needs are well covered by earnings and cash flows.Story continuesWe project 5% annual earnings per share growth in the coming years, meaning not only that Pfizer should see its share price move higher over time but also that the company has additional capital for dividend raises. We believe the company will raise its dividend indefinitely.Shares trade under eight times this year’s earnings, which is well under our estimate of fair value at 11 times. When combining the potential tailwind from the valuation, the 3.2% yield and 5% projected growth, we get a total annual return potential of about 14%. As such, we rate Pfizer a buy for both income and price appreciation.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comNext on our list of healthcare stocks is Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). The company develops, manufactures and distributes medical devices to hospitals, doctors, clinics and patients worldwide. Medtronic stock has declined 25% year-to-date (YTD), making it a value pick among healthcare stocks.Medtronic produces cardiovascular products, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, monitoring systems and more. It also has a medical surgical portfolio that offers stapling devices, sealing and closure instruments, mesh implants, ventilation therapies and related products. The neuroscience business offers products for various types of surgeries, as well as imaging system robot-assisted spinal procedures and others.Medtronic was founded in 1949. It produces about $30 billion in annual revenue and has a current market cap of $103 billion. It has an extremely impressive dividend increase streak of 45 years, putting it in elite company. That also means Medtronic has stood the test of time and economic weakness. It has raised its dividend through all kinds of market conditions.Shares yield 3.5% today as well, which is more than double the S&amp;P 500. It’s also very high by Medtronic’s own historical norms, which have seen the stock typically yield about 2%. That means the dividend offers exceptional value today for buyers of the stock.Medtronic’s payout ratio is just over half of earnings this year, which is somewhat elevated against historical tendencies. The company has seen somewhat choppier earnings in the past handful of years, but the dividend is quite well covered nonetheless.Speaking of earnings, we expect 6% growth going forward for Medtronic, which should be driven mostly by revenue improvements, as well as some margin expansion associated with it. Finally, the company is buying back a robust number of shares and boosting EPS as a result.With the stock trades under 15 times earnings, versus a fair value estimate of 17 times earnings, Medtronic also offers potential capital appreciation from a rising valuation. When we combine this tailwind with the 3.5% yield and 6% growth, we project total annual returns of about 12%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur final pick for this list of healthcare stocks is UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), a diversified healthcare company that operates in the U.S. It operates through four segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. Through these segments, UnitedHealth has one of the largest healthcare businesses in the world. It offers a huge variety of products. Additionally, the company offers health benefit plans and services for employers of all kinds through its UnitedHealthcare business, as well as individuals. The Optum business collectively offers health management services, software and advisory services, and pharmacy care and medication fulfillment, among others.UnitedHealth was founded in the late 1970s. It generates about $325 billion in annual revenue and trades with a market cap of $500 billion.Like Pfizer, UnitedHealth has a relatively modest dividend-increase streak of 13 years. However, the company has proven to be willing and able to raise its dividend at very rapid rates over time, and we find it to be one of the best dividend growth stocks available today.The yield is modest at 1.2%, owed to the stock’s massive run it has experienced in recent years. That has made it such that the dividend has had a difficult time keeping pace with the share price. Still, the payout ratio is just 30% for this year, and we expect to see very strong dividend growth for many years to come.Not only is the payout ratio low, but we forecast 12% EPS growth in the years to come, meaning ample capital should be available to the management team. The company’s ability to generate revenue growth year after year has turned it into not only a great dividend stock but also a great stock to own for capital appreciation.In total, we expect to see about 9% total returns for UnitedHealth.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

74,5e6b9616-41ae-3d8f-b655-13b7d72edf2a,CCI,2023-01-09,Why Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-crown-castle-inc-nyse-140049390.html,1673186449,STORY,['CCI'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Crown Castle How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:21% = US$1.6b ÷ US$7.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.Does Crown Castle Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Crown Castle has a better ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Crown Castle's Debt And Its 21% Return On EquityCrown Castle clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.77. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Medicine. The recent pandemic was the best reflection of the advancements in the field of medicine. Vaccines were developed at a lightning-fast pace, with the first vaccine for Covid-19 approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only a year after the outbreak. It was developed by a joint effort of two of the most advanced pharmaceutical companies when it comes to R&amp;D - Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The former is an American company while the latter is German.Other top pharma companies include names like Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN).Due to the medicine industry’s role in the improvement of human well-being, it leads to GDP growth through labor productivity and personal spending. The correlation coefficients for this are demonstrable.  The US, Switzerland and Norway are some of the most advanced countries when it comes to the field of medicine, with huge healthcare spending, numerous pharmaceutical companies and sophisticated academia.OutlookMedicine is one of the fastest growing fields in the world. It encompasses the pharmaceutical industry, medical schools and hospitals. The demand for healthcare is expected to increase due to a variety of factors, such as an aging population and advances in medical technology. According to the Pharma Outlook 2030 by KPMG, many trends are shaping the pharma industry for 2030. For instance, the free-for-service payment model is increasingly being challenged by the end-users, hospitals and insurance agencies. They want the pricing model to be designed around the success and the quality of the product. One of the most prominent results of this is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI)’s 2016 value-based contracts with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) for cholesterol drugs, with the insurance agencies receiving discounts if their therapies do not reduce cholesterol levels enough. Story continuesAdvances in big data and machine learning are also likely to allow for the pre-emptive measures against the onset of diseases instead of just treating them. Further, machine learning is also set to play a pivotal role in drug discovery.A recent example is the AlphaFold, a deep learning model by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s subsidiary - DeepMind. It has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, an important leap in drug discovery. Priorly, it had been a challenge that had puzzled molecular biologists for half a century. Major advances are primarily happening on the academic front of medicine, and AI in the field is pervasive. For instance, Harvard University researchers have come up with an automated cancer detection system, which uses AI to find breast cancer by examining lymph node cells. Given the trends, AI is largely going to be an integral field to medicine. Another field that is likely to augment the pharma industry by 2030 is nanotechnology. In this regard, Novartis, in partnership with Proteus, has developed a smart pill that can be swallowed for diagnostics purposes. The pharmaceutical manufacturing market is one of the fastest growing in the world. It was worth $358 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a valuation of $1.2 trillion by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 13%, as reported by Precedence Research.On the other hand, the drug-discovery industry was valued at $75 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 9%, to $162 billion in 2030.Lastly, the hospital industry is projected to be valued at $2 trillion by 2028, after a growth with a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period of 2021-2028. It was valued at $820 billion in 2021.Let’s now move to the 15 most advanced countries in medicine. 15 Most Advanced Countries in MedicinePhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur Methodology For our list of the most advanced nations in medicine, we’ve ranked them based on three reports. These are the following - Legatum Prosperity Index, 2021, Countries’ Citations in Clinical Medicine, by Institute of Scientific Information, and the CEO-World report of the countries with the best healthcare systems in 2021. Legatum Prosperity Index’s health ‘pillar’ measures the extent to which people have access to essential and advanced healthcare services. The Institute of Scientific Information report, on the other hand, is about the number of citations per paper for countries in the field of clinical medicine. Lastly, the CEO-World report is based on a statistical analysis that accounted for factors such as healthcare infrastructure, government readiness, healthcare professionals and quality of medicine among others. We’ve averaged out the rankings for the top countries in the three reports. We haven’t considered the countries that did not appear in more than one report. The data for healthcare spending and physicians per 1,000 people in our listed countries comes from the World Bank.Here are the 15 most advanced countries in medicine:15.

Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) ROE?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/concerned-v-f-corporations-nyse-102433966.html,1673259873,STORY,['VFC'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for V.F How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for V.F is:14% = US$424m ÷ US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.Does V.F Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, V.F has a lower ROE than the average (21%) in the Luxury industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 4 risks we have identified for V.F.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining V.F's Debt And Its 14% Return On EquityV.F clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.96. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

On a month-over-month basis, CPI likely stayed flat.Core CPI, which removes the volatile food and energy components of the report and is closely tracked by the Fed, is also expected to have risen at a slower pace last month, coming in at 5.7% after a 6% increase in November. Over the prior month, core CPI is expected to rise 0.3% after a 0.2% jump in November.Policymakers monitor ""core"" inflation more closely due to its nuanced look at key inputs like housing, while the headline CPI figure has moved largely in tandem with volatile energy prices this year.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.JPMorgan (JPM), the largest consumer bank in the U.S., will also deliver quarterly financial results along with industry peers Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday morning as fourth quarter earnings season gets underway.Wall Street's banking giants — which have warned about the state of the economy, seen tremendous drop-offs in dealmaking revenues, and even begun trimming their workforces — are expected to offer the Street disappointing results.Another 'encouraging' jobs reportOn Friday, U.S. stocks soared after the latest monthly jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 223,000 in December as the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%.While these figures suggest an imbalance between labor supply and demand is still at hand, investors celebrated cooling wage growth as a sign the Fed may scale back its rate-hiking ambitions.Story continuesFor the week, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each gained roughly 1.5% while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1%. All three major averages surged more than 2% Friday.""This is an encouraging jobs report for the Fed that shows the narrow path to a soft landing remains a possibility with wages cooling without requiring widespread job destruction,"" Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments said in a note Friday. ""This print on its own doesn’t clearly support a 25- or a 50-basis-point hike at the next Fed meeting in February, and as a result, Thursday's CPI release could prove crucial for that decision.""The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group of Fed officials that vote on policy changes, is set to convene January 31-February 1 and deliver the first rate increase of 2023 and eighth of the current hiking cycle. Last month, the Fed raised interest rates by 50 basis points, bringing total increases to its benchmark policy rate to 4.25% in 2022.Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, head of multi-asset retail investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said Friday's jobs report adds to a series of economic releases that continue to place equal odds of a 25- or 50-basis-point rate increase at the next meeting. In other words, uncertainty remains.""The [December jobs] report will most likely add to the growing narrative of a disinflationary environment crossing with a robust economy, and therefore a soft landing,"" Wilson-Elizondo said in emailed comments. ""This could prove positive for stocks in the short-term; however, our positioning remains risk-off into 2023.""Wilson-Elizondo added: ""It’s hard to see how risky assets can compete with approximately 5% yields in money market funds until more clarity is delivered on the inflation and growth mix. We expect the Fed to remain restrictive until there is clear evidence that tightness in the labor market is consistently improving.”WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 21: U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Bank earnings lead the wayJPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, along with asset management conglomerate BlackRock (BLK), are all set to report results in a flurry before the market open on Friday.Banks typically benefit from central bank policy tightening, with higher interest rates boosting their net interest income — or the spread between a bank's earnings on lending activities and interest it pays to depositors — and net interest margins. However, challenging market conditions that have dealt a blow to dealmaking, a primary profit driver, are poised to offset other aspects of their business.""We are not likely to see any traction in investment banking, as equity and debt underwriting, as well as merger and acquisition markets, are expected to have disappointing performance,"" Kenneth Leon, research director at CFRA Research, said in a note.Leon also warned of ""significant declines"" in equity underwriting, including IPOs. According to a report on the IPO market last month from EY, 2022 saw just 1,333 initial public offerings worldwide based on data through Dec. 14, with these debuts raising a total of $179.5 billion — a 45% drop in listings raising and 61% fewer dollars raised compared to 2021.Another notable component of bank earnings will be any insights credit card balances and savings accounts offer on the health of U.S. consumers.Data last week from JPMorgan Asset Management, the bank's investment management arm, estimated ""excess savings"" for U.S. households now stand at $900 billion, down from a peak of $2.1 trillion in early 2021 and roughly $1.9 trillion at the beginning of last year. The drop shows inflation has effectively wiped out half of the savings Americans have accumulated since the pandemic began.UNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 22: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives for a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)Even JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon warned in a recent interview that inflation may tip the U.S. economy into recession this year.“Inflation is eroding everything I just said,"" Dimon noted, referring to consumer balance sheets that for now have held up, ""and that trillion and a half dollars will run out sometime midyear next year.""Elsewhere on the calendar, investors will also get get a measure of real average hourly earnings, readings on import and export prices, and a consumer sentiment check from the University of Michigan's closely watched survey.Earnings from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY), which said it was facing bankruptcy last week, Delta Air Lines (DAL), and UnitedHealth (UNH) are also notable reports on tap.—Economic CalendarMonday: Consumer Credit, November ($25.000 billion expected, $27.078 billion during prior month)Tuesday: NFIB Small Business Optimism, December (91.4 expected, 91.9 during prior month); Wholesale Trade Sales, month-over-month, November (0.4% during prior month); Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, November Final (1.0% expected, 1.0% during previous month)Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 6 (-10.3% during prior week)Thursday: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, December (0.0% expected, 0.1% during prior month); CPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, December (0.3% expected, 0.2% during prior month); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, December (6.6% expected, 7.1% during prior month); CPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, December (5.7% expected, 6.0% during prior month); Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, December (-1.9% during prior month, revised to -2.1%); Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, December (-3.0% during prior month, downwardly revised to -3.3%); Initial jobless claims, week ended Jan. 7 (214,000 expected, 204,000 during prior week); Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 31 (1.694 million during prior week)Friday: Import Price Index, year-over-year, December (2.2% expected, 2.7% during prior month); Import Price Index, month-over-month, December (-0.7% expected, -0.3% during prior month); Import Price Index excluding petroleum, month-over-month, December (-0.3% expected, -0.3% during prior month); Export Price Index, year-over-year, December (6.3% during prior month); Export Price Index, month-over-month, December (-0.7% expected, -0.3% during prior month); University of Michigan Sentiment, January Preliminary (60.5 expected, 59.7 prior reading)—Earnings CalendarMonday: Acuity Brands (AYI), AZZ (AZZ), Commercial Metals (CMC), PriceSmart (PSMT), Tilray (TLRY), WD-40 (WDFC)Tuesday: Albertsons (ACI), Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)Wednesday: KB Home (KBH), Shaw Communications (SJR)Thursday: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM),Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), BlackRock (BLK), First Republic Bank (FRC), Wells Fargo (WFC), UnitedHealth (UNH)—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Medicine. The recent pandemic was the best reflection of the advancements in the field of medicine. Vaccines were developed at a lightning-fast pace, with the first vaccine for Covid-19 approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only a year after the outbreak. It was developed by a joint effort of two of the most advanced pharmaceutical companies when it comes to R&amp;D - Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The former is an American company while the latter is German.Other top pharma companies include names like Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN).Due to the medicine industry’s role in the improvement of human well-being, it leads to GDP growth through labor productivity and personal spending. The correlation coefficients for this are demonstrable.  The US, Switzerland and Norway are some of the most advanced countries when it comes to the field of medicine, with huge healthcare spending, numerous pharmaceutical companies and sophisticated academia.OutlookMedicine is one of the fastest growing fields in the world. It encompasses the pharmaceutical industry, medical schools and hospitals. The demand for healthcare is expected to increase due to a variety of factors, such as an aging population and advances in medical technology. According to the Pharma Outlook 2030 by KPMG, many trends are shaping the pharma industry for 2030. For instance, the free-for-service payment model is increasingly being challenged by the end-users, hospitals and insurance agencies. They want the pricing model to be designed around the success and the quality of the product. One of the most prominent results of this is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI)’s 2016 value-based contracts with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) for cholesterol drugs, with the insurance agencies receiving discounts if their therapies do not reduce cholesterol levels enough. Story continuesAdvances in big data and machine learning are also likely to allow for the pre-emptive measures against the onset of diseases instead of just treating them. Further, machine learning is also set to play a pivotal role in drug discovery.A recent example is the AlphaFold, a deep learning model by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s subsidiary - DeepMind. It has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, an important leap in drug discovery. Priorly, it had been a challenge that had puzzled molecular biologists for half a century. Major advances are primarily happening on the academic front of medicine, and AI in the field is pervasive. For instance, Harvard University researchers have come up with an automated cancer detection system, which uses AI to find breast cancer by examining lymph node cells. Given the trends, AI is largely going to be an integral field to medicine. Another field that is likely to augment the pharma industry by 2030 is nanotechnology. In this regard, Novartis, in partnership with Proteus, has developed a smart pill that can be swallowed for diagnostics purposes. The pharmaceutical manufacturing market is one of the fastest growing in the world.

These are the following - Legatum Prosperity Index, 2021, Countries’ Citations in Clinical Medicine, by Institute of Scientific Information, and the CEO-World report of the countries with the best healthcare systems in 2021. Legatum Prosperity Index’s health ‘pillar’ measures the extent to which people have access to essential and advanced healthcare services. The Institute of Scientific Information report, on the other hand, is about the number of citations per paper for countries in the field of clinical medicine. Lastly, the CEO-World report is based on a statistical analysis that accounted for factors such as healthcare infrastructure, government readiness, healthcare professionals and quality of medicine among others. We’ve averaged out the rankings for the top countries in the three reports.

Selling at an average price of US$202, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Target The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TargetOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Harrison, for US$453k worth of shares, at about US$218 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$160. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Target didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Target better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of TargetMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Target insiders own about US$161m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Target Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Target shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Target insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 4 warning signs (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Target.Story continuesOf course Target may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeMacy's (M) dumped some bad news on Friday evening.Management teams for public companies will sometimes think it's clever trying to bury bad news into a weekend in hopes investors will forget it before the opening bell on Monday.The lame tactic rarely works.So let's break down this textbook news dump Macy's pulled on Friday afternoon:Net Sales: Expected to be at the low end to mid-point of guidance for $8.16 billion to $8.40 billion. Analysts were modeling for $8.31 billion in sales, according to Yahoo Finance data.Adjusted EPS: Expected to be within the guidance range of $1.47 to $1.67. Yahoo Finance data shows analysts were banking on $1.60 a share.Key management comment: “Based on current macro-economic indicators and our proprietary credit card data, we believe the consumer will continue to be pressured in 2023, particularly in the first half, and have planned inventory mix and depth of initial buys accordingly,"" said Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette. ""We take a balanced approach to merchandise receipts and remain committed to offering fashion and value across nameplates and channels, with the capacity to adjust in-season buys and chase into areas of strength.""A person poses for a photo at an interactive Macy's holiday window display in New York City, U.S., December 9, 2022. REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoWith this earnings pre-announcement, Macy's essentially issued a profit warning for the first half of 2023 in addition to telegraphing a less-than-stellar holiday season.While Macy's inventory levels look to be in good shape despite the sales miss, look for the Street to slash their profit estimates for 2023 amid margin pressures and a more cautious consumer. The stock is likely dead money — with a downward bias — until we get evidence of a re-acceleration in consumer spending (for Macy's and other retailers, hopefully this happens before the spring selling season).Story continuesBad fourth quarters and outlooks are probably coming from the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL), V.F. Corp. (VFC), Under Armour (UAA), and other suppliers to department stores. lf Macy's is planning first half orders cautiously, best believe rivals such as JC Penney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), and Dillard's (DDS) are doing the same.The negative comments on Target (TGT) last week from Wells Fargo make even more sense in the wake of this Macy's warning. Target's merchandise skews more discretionary than Walmart's (WMT), putting its numbers at greater risk inside of a sluggish spending backdrop. Along those lines, I agree with the cautious pre-earnings analysis on toymakers Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) — lots of excess toy inventory has been seen post peak holiday season.Macy's called out its cosmetics banner Bluemercury as solid. Walgreens (WBA) also said in its earnings release last week cosmetics performed well. The signs point to another good quarter from Ulta (ULTA).Wall Street's vibe on retailers""Inflation in discretionary retail, apparel, handbags, other accessories, shoes, home goods and electronics probably ran 3% in Q4 2022 and will run that or less in Q1 2023. And, they will finish the year running between 2.5% and 3% inflation. Why? We have oversupply again like we have had for the last forty years, not counting 2020 and 2021. We have reduced demand due to the expiration of COVID emergency funds going into the pockets of the consumer. We have rising interest rates reducing the demand for new mortgages and new mortgages drive the sale of home goods. We are back to 2019. We have at least marginally rising unemployment and marginally falling JOLTS. Inflation in discretionary retail is dead."" -Jan Rogers Kniffen, JK Worldwide Enterprises""Continually softer quarter to date footfall alone suggests 4Q sales could be running below or at the low-end of revenue guidance/forecasts. This trend, in addition to the fact that 1) the key 4Q shopping days are mostly behind us, 2) potentially unfavorable year over year weather is on deck for January (despite the easy Omicron lap), 3) retailers still appear to hold high inventory levels (with goals of being “clean” by year end…), &amp; 4) select retailers/brands have already buckled as it relates to raising discounting activity above 2019 levels, heightens our fears that promotional/discounting activity likely worsens from here. This would subsequently pressure 4Q merchandise margin. That said, we admit elevated promotional/discounting activity feels mostly contemplated in conservative 4Q guidance &amp; consensus estimates, &amp; retailers face an easier GM compare versus 3Q."" -Kimberly Greenberger, Morgan StanleyHave a great week.

(NYSE:V), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 4.8% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 3.5%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Visa, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Visa already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Visa's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Visa. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.0%. With 6.0% and 3.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of VisaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Visa Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$235m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Readings for the previous two months were revised lower, while wage growth also eased.The reading eased fears that an overheated U.S. jobs market will prevent inflation from easing further this year, and pushed up expectations that the Federal Reserve will soften its hawkish stance sooner than expected, letting up pressure on gold and other non-yielding assets.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,868.61 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,873.15 an ounce by 19:35 ET (00:35 GMT). Both instruments were trading at their highest level since early-June, after rallying nearly 2% on Friday.The dollar softened further on Monday after reversing most of last week’s gains on the payrolls data, while 10-year Treasury yields also drifted lower.Focus now turns to U.S. consumer price index inflation data due on Thursday for more cues on the path of U.S. interest rates. CPI inflation is expected to have sunk to a one-year low in December, indicating that a series of sharp interest rate hikes by the Fed in 2022 are having their intended effect.These rate hikes walloped gold prices last year, as they pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. But the yellow metal saw a resurgence in interest over the past month, with safe haven demand also coming back into play amid fears of a potential recession in 2023.The Fed is now expected to further slow its pace of interest rate hikes, with a majority of traders pricing in an only 25 basis point hike in February. But the central bank has warned that it could keep rates higher for longer.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated slightly on Monday, but hovered near a seven-month high after optimism over the reopening of China’s international borders triggered a sharp rally in the red metal.Copper futures fell 0.4% to $3.9588 a pound, coming off a 2.6% rally last week.Prices of the red metal shot up after China further eased anti-COVID measures this month, a move markets hope will trigger a quick economic rebound in the world’s largest copper importer.Related ArticlesGold prices rise to 7-month high as hawkish Fed fears ebbOil nudges higher after China opens borders, lifts fuel demand outlookEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Tapestry's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Tapestry How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tapestry is:37% = US$825m ÷ US$2.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.37 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Tapestry's Earnings Growth And 37% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Tapestry has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 21% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Tapestry's moderate 9.1% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Tapestry's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TPR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Tapestry Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Tapestry has a low three-year median payout ratio of 8.4%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 92% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Tapestry has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 29% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Tapestry's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 6% year-to-date, so far. However, with some research, picking out the top-performing stocks for 2023 can set a framework from which to build an investment portfolio that will outperform its peers. Most analysts believe that a potential economic recession will be significantly less severe than the last one. Hence, it’s best to invest in some of the top Dow stocks to buy for the long haul.The names mentioned below are some of the most robust businesses effectively generating incredible free cash flows. These companies have effectively weathered the economic storm this year and continue to march forward with considerable aplomb. Moreover, these stocks are trading at a hefty discount, offering tremendous upside potential.AAPLApple$126.20HDHome Depot$314.00TRVTravelers Companies$186.96CATCaterpillar$239.65CVXChevron$175.36KOCoca-Cola$62.24MCDMcDonald’s$262.15Dow Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockOne of the top Dow stocks to buy is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its success as one of the most influential technology companies worldwide can be attributed to its closed-loop ecosystem. The integrated system enables Apple to produce lucrative, continuously updated products with the latest software and technologies, demonstrating its commitment to innovation and modernization. Coupled with their impressive financial track record, including a consistent improvement in sales and earnings, it’s no wonder that Apple remains a powerful force in the tech sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the news of production issues due to China’s COVID-19 lockdowns, Apple’s position and impressive reputation remain unshakable. Warren Buffet, one of the most decorated investors of all time, has maintained Apple as the largest single holding in his illustrious portfolio. This trust in the company is further evidenced by the fact that its stock is down over 20% from its peak levels at the moment, making it an extremely attractive opportunity for value investors. All signs thus point to this being an excellent period to invest in AAPL stock before the markets recover.Story continuesDow Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comDespite the volatility HD as one of the top Dow stocks to buy, there’s a lot to like about it over the long-term. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is heavily focused on digitalization and sustainability, which puts them in a unique position once the market recovers. The company has also set up an equity line to expand its services and new products for customers. Additionally, Home Depot has taken numerous cost-saving initiatives that have enabled it to increase inventory availability and reduce operating costs. These strategies will help them continue to be a leader within the retail home improvement space even when economic conditions are challenging.With rising interest rates, it is becoming necessary for people to become more involved in DIY projects. The inflationary environment has taken a far larger bite out of real household earnings than normal, thus fostering the need for more DIY projects. As such, it can be viewed as a beneficial situation for Home Depot, which can provide the necessary resources and materials needed to complete them. The cost savings consumers will realize from handyman services repurposed as DIY can turn consumer sentiment and loyalty towards Home Depot, resulting in greater returns for shareholders and prosperity for investors.Dow Stocks to Buy: Travelers Companies (TRV)Red umbrella covering stacks of billsSource: ShutterstockTravelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) is an another one of the top Dow stocks to buy for those wanting to invest in an inelastic enterprise. It has an incredibly strong reach across the United States economy as the second-largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance. With rising rates, this company can be expected to outshine many other stocks as it stands its ground without major problems during booms and busts–great news for investors who are stabilized by security and some assurance that they’ll get a return on their investments. The travel industry is certainly never immune to economic fluctuations and disruption; however, the demand for important insurance policies will remain strong.This is because individuals understand more now than ever that anything can happen in this unpredictable world. The coronavirus pandemic has proven this point beyond a shadow of a doubt as it brought about an unexpected upheaval across the globe. Still, such extreme circumstances may make it difficult for some people to purchase a critical policy – that much must be acknowledged. Nonetheless, travelers can rely on secure, consistent, and predictable entertainment from comprehensive insurance coverage, no matter the volatility of the markets or the state of the economy.Caterpillar (CAT)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is in a strong position to benefit from current economic trends. Washington’s newfound interest in investing in infrastructure projects has been great news for the company, which specializes in providing heavy equipment essential for major building projects. Even better news comes from America’s factory boom, which proves to be an extra lucrative business for CAT, with factories relying on their equipment to keep operations running smoothly. Moreover, the variety of revenue streams makes Caterpillar an appealing proposition for investors seeking profits.The firm had an extraordinary third quarter this year, smashing expectations and setting records for the firm’s performance. It reported a top line of $15 billion and  third-quarter earnings per share of $3.87, an impressive jump from the $2.60 seen a year earlier. Despite challenging conditions with high inflation, operating profits were still able to reach 16.2%, nearly 3% higher than in the third quarter of 2021.Chevron (CVX)For savvy investors, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) looks like an attractive option at the moment. Its recently-released third quarter results highlighted a net profit of $11.2 billion, squeezing it just behind its record-breaking second-quarter earnings this year. Although the company’s profitability was, as expected, affected by lower oil prices, there still remains considerable potential for strong returns in the near future – something investors should certainly consider. Its portfolio of projects and investments is substantial, providing shareholders with much certainty of continued success and stability. Therefore, Chevron appears to be a safe investment choice right now and may bring good returns in the long run.CVX stock has been up over 40% since the start of the year. It’s a remarkable achievement that current investors will likely be celebrating. They have been reaping the rewards of capital gains and enjoy a healthy quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share and a solid yield of over 3%.Coca-Cola (KO)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is an iconic consumer stock that continues to turn heads with its outstanding performances. The legendary Warren Buffet has long been a fan, and his backing provides confidence to investors looking to diversify their portfolios with some big-name stocks. On top of that, Coca-Cola has been increasing its dividends yearly for 60 years now, an impressive feat by any measure and an additional attraction when considering the potential payouts. If I’m looking into consumer stocks right now, Coca-Cola is definitely on my shopping list.Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and many other struggles, Coca-Cola has still managed to bring in strong earnings. Its impressive profit margins are a testament to its tremendous pricing power across the board. Although KO stock may not have been a star performer over the last two years, it’s worth holding for the long haul due to its stellar fundamentals, long-term attractiveness, and consistent track record.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock has proven to be a very rewarding investment for its shareholders over the past 10 years. It has yielded over 13% annual total return in the past decade. It has also demonstrated its commitment to shareholders by paying out $3.92 billion in dividends throughout 2021 and currently offering a yield of 2.30%, making it an attractive choice for anyone looking for reliable dividend income from a sound company with robust future prospects.Despite inflationary pressures hitting everyone’s pocketbooks, McDonalds has managed to remain competitive. On average, the fast food giant has raised prices by 10%, but its third-quarter results demonstrated that it also gained an increasing market share in the low-income consumer sector. That implies that despite price increases, McDonald’s has provided great value and affordability for those with low purchasing power. With these positive results over the past nine consecutive quarters of growth in U.S. same-store and worldwide sales, its pricing strategy is well-founded.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

103,613eda67-f7b0-3b4d-b4b8-152ba9272bf0,CMI,2023-01-09,"With 84% ownership, Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-ownership-cummins-inc-nyse-140057163.html,1673186457,STORY,['CMI'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cummins. View our latest analysis for Cummins ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cummins?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Cummins already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cummins' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cummins. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CumminsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Cummins Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$145m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Cummins. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Cummins , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

105,99397582-bed2-3c05-bb47-ea2223611e5f,DIS,2023-01-09,The End of the Netflix-ization of TV and the Beginning of a New Streaming Bundle,WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/99397582-bed2-3c05-bb47-ea2223611e5f/the-end-of-the.html,1673257860,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS']","[This year may mark the end of the Netflix-ization of that thing we used to call television. The clamor to meet consumers where they are — on their phones and Apple TVs, but most definitely not in front of a television with a cable box and a bundle of linear channels — produced a streaming gold rush that was a boon for writers and directors (and famous people) who could get barely baked projects green-lit without so much as a pitch deck. The rush by legacy media brands to launch streaming platforms was accelerated during the pandemic lockdown of 2020.But with Wall Street no longer in thrall to a potential streaming gold rush that never really materialized, 2023 may be the year the media industry is finally forced to live within it means.More from WWD'The White Lotus' Season 2 Costumes for Jennifer Coolidge, Aubrey Plaza &amp; More'Wednesday' Costumes From Season 1 on Netflix: The Standout Styles'Emily in Paris' Season 3 Premiere Red Carpet Fetes Lily Collins, Ashley Park &amp; More StarsThe streaming wars — the term is something of a misnomer since Netflix won the war before it even commenced — birthed a plethora of new platforms and a glut of content. Much of it forgettable and more than the population of connected consumers could realistically consume. It spurred all manner of irrational exuberance on the part of content providers flush with subscriber cash and hungry for ever more “original” content to feed the digital maw. Lavish development deals rained down on reliable hit makers (Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy) and people who had never seen the inside of a development meeting (the Obamas, Harry and Meghan). Now, the economic headwinds (inflation, recession) are blowing home the roosting chickens.A spate of pre-holiday layoffs rocked the industry — thousands of rank-and-file employees have been pink-slipped, but so have lavishly paid executives, most famously Disney chief executive officer Bob Chapek, who was unceremoniously dumped in the wake of a disastrous earnings report and succeeded by his predecessor who handpicked him, Bob Iger.Story continuesWarner Bros. Discovery shuttered streaming service CNN+, has so far laid off more than 1,000 employees across the company, canceled shows and scratched movies (the completed $90 million “Batgirl”) in favor of write-downs as CEO David Zaslav — saddled with an eye-popping $50 billion in post-merger debt — has promised to find $3 billion in annual savings. Paramount Global nixed its Showtime streaming app, parting ways with veteran executive David Nevins and CBS Entertainment chief Kelly Kahl, while enacting layoffs in multiple departments including marketing and ad sales. Disney rolled out a range of cost-cutting measures including layoffs, hiring freezes and limits on company travel.At Netflix, which lost half its value in 2022 (compared to 17 percent for the S&amp;P 500), hundreds of employees were let go (mostly in the U.S.). Though it still plans to spend about $17 billion annually on content, roughly what it has shelled out in recent years, late last year Netflix launched a lower priced ad-supported tier, after years of mocking the industry standard ad-dollar imperative. (Disney+ also launched an ad-supported tier while Peacock launched as an advertising-based video on demand, or AVOD, service, and Hulu, Paramount+ and HBO Max have all previously offered both ad-supported and premium tiers.)For consumers, the industry’s annus horribilis will mean less content — though viewers will be excused for not noticing. This is not necessarily deleterious if development executives are forced to focus on quality over quantity. (Would Zaslav have canceled HBO’s “Westworld,” shocking the show’s staff and angering fans, if he had less bad TV on its books?)This shift will not take hold everywhere. Amazon — which has the biggest inventory of content with no discernible original content strategy — shows no signs of identifying a strategy. This is, after all, the company that spent $20 million on the well-meaning but middling reviewed documentary “Wildcat” — about an Afghanistan war veteran and an adorable baby ocelot — an enormous amount of money for a nature film. But Amazon will streamline spending, announcing 18,000 layoffs on Wednesday — deeper cuts than expected — in the company’s devices, books and stores divisions, which includes its main site, as well as field and warehouse operations. Apple TV+ will continue apace, though the service has always green-lit far fewer programs compared to its streaming competitors.With such stiff economic headwinds, 2023 likely portends the end of peak TV. The term was coined by FX chief John Landgraf at the dawn of a modern golden era for scripted television, especially hour-long dramas, but also half-hour dramedies. And while streamers are likely to still churn out reality TV and low-budget unscripted content, there will be much more budget scrutiny when it comes to big-ticket scripted programming. “[2022] will mark the peak of the peak TV era,” predicted Landgraf during a conference call with reporters at the semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour last summer.According to the FX Research department, 357 scripted series launched in the first half of 2022, an increase of 16 percent year-over-year. But post-Netflix stock swoon — which happened in April 2022 — the industry is very clearly in retrench mode. During the second half of 2022, the number of commissioned scripted series in the U.S. declined by 24 percent year-over-year, according to U.K.-based research firm Ampere Analysis. The companies that slashed scripted commissions the most were Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global.The saturated streaming market that led to subscriber losses or sluggish growth and is overwhelming consumers with too much content and too many services is also spurring a demand for a streaming bundle that offers consumers the kind of one-stop shopping that the antiquated cable bundle delivered. According to a recent survey from e-commerce data firm Bango, 72 percent of U.S. subscription video on demand (SVOD) respondents said there are “too many subscription services,” while close to 80 percent said they want a single platform to manage all of their subscriptions. As if on cue, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed on Dec. 6 that HBO Max would once again be available on Prime video channels in the U.S.Paramount+, Starz, AMC+ and Hulu also are available on Prime, for a fee. Netflix and Disney+ are not; they don’t need to be. Disney+ reported subscriber growth to 164.2 million for the final quarter of the 2022 fiscal year; across its combined intracompany streaming bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+, the company finished the year with 235.7 million global subscribers, surpassing Netflix’s 223 million.But for smaller services, a bundled approach may be the only way to realize scale in a saturated market. Paramount CEO Bob Bakish has been bullish on the bundle. Paramount+ reported 46 million global subscribers for the third quarter of 2022, rising to 67 million when its other streaming services (including the CBS News streaming service CBSN and CBS Sports HQ) are included.There are impediments to a global bundle that includes competing services — lower revenue and control of a user interface among them. But with economic headwinds continuing to swirl in 2023, the new streaming could begin to look a lot like the old TV.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Colgate-Palmolive, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Colgate-Palmolive. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Colgate-Palmolive. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.8% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$67m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Colgate-Palmolive. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

110,e2e3f498-f4bd-359b-8a02-499441b56f22,CMCSA,2023-01-09,Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 91% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporations-nasdaq-cmcsa-intrinsic-110029652.html,1673262029,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Comcast The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$14.3bUS$15.6bUS$16.5bUS$18.0bUS$19.8bUS$21.1bUS$22.1bUS$23.0bUS$23.8bUS$24.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x18Analyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 6.25%Est @ 4.97%Est @ 4.07%Est @ 3.44%Est @ 3.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$13.2kUS$13.3kUS$13.1kUS$13.1kUS$13.4kUS$13.2kUS$12.8kUS$12.3kUS$11.8kUS$11.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$127bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$406bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$406b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$185bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$313b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$37.9, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Comcast as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ComcastStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like United Rentals (NYSE:URI), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals How Quickly Is United Rentals Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that United Rentals has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that United Rentals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.1 percentage points to 27%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for United Rentals.Story continuesAre United Rentals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of United Rentals, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$106m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add United Rentals To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Rentals' strong EPS growth.

114,3adccb51-96dd-3467-a481-f11b091f9fd8,MCD,2023-01-09,McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) investors will be pleased with their respectable 75% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-investors-pleased-120050149.html,1673265650,STORY,['MCD'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) share price is up 55% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 34% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 4.2% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for McDonald's While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, McDonald's managed to grow its earnings per share at 3.0% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on McDonald's' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for McDonald's the TSR over the last 5 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McDonald's shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.2% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 12% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for McDonald's  that you should be aware of.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth I (TBCIX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-blue-chip-120012871.html,1673265612,STORY,"['TROW', '^GSPC']","[On the lookout for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? Starting with T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth I (TBCIX) should not be a possibility at this time. TBCIX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerT. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of TBCIX. Since T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth I made its debut in December of 2015, TBCIX has garnered more than $28.58 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by Paul Greene who has been in charge of the fund since October of 2021.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 7.11%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 2.71%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. TBCIX's standard deviation over the past three years is 23.75% compared to the category average of 18.61%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 21.17% compared to the category average of 16.34%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.06, which means it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. TBCIX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -3.62, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, TBCIX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.57% compared to the category average of 0.99%. TBCIX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $500,000, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth I ( TBCIX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth I ( TBCIX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.This could just be the start of your research on TBCIXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

118,01f337c0-f98b-3e25-98c9-51fd7ad50f1e,NI,2023-01-09,Is NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) Trading At A 49% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nisource-inc-nyse-ni-trading-101220599.html,1673259140,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC']","[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for NiSource The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$1.33b-US$926.3mUS$100.0mUS$352.0mUS$575.1mUS$833.6mUS$1.10bUS$1.35bUS$1.58bUS$1.78bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 63.37%Est @ 44.95%Est @ 32.06%Est @ 23.04%Est @ 16.72%Est @ 12.30% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% -US$1.2k-US$812US$82.1US$271US$414US$562US$695US$801US$875US$921(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.6bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$38bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$38b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$20bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$27.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NiSource as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NiSourceStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For NiSource, we've put together three fundamental factors you should look at:Risks: For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for NiSource (1 is concerning)  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does NI's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeMacy's (M) dumped some bad news on Friday evening.Management teams for public companies will sometimes think it's clever trying to bury bad news into a weekend in hopes investors will forget it before the opening bell on Monday.The lame tactic rarely works.So let's break down this textbook news dump Macy's pulled on Friday afternoon:Net Sales: Expected to be at the low end to mid-point of guidance for $8.16 billion to $8.40 billion. Analysts were modeling for $8.31 billion in sales, according to Yahoo Finance data.Adjusted EPS: Expected to be within the guidance range of $1.47 to $1.67. Yahoo Finance data shows analysts were banking on $1.60 a share.Key management comment: “Based on current macro-economic indicators and our proprietary credit card data, we believe the consumer will continue to be pressured in 2023, particularly in the first half, and have planned inventory mix and depth of initial buys accordingly,"" said Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette. ""We take a balanced approach to merchandise receipts and remain committed to offering fashion and value across nameplates and channels, with the capacity to adjust in-season buys and chase into areas of strength.""A person poses for a photo at an interactive Macy's holiday window display in New York City, U.S., December 9, 2022. REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoWith this earnings pre-announcement, Macy's essentially issued a profit warning for the first half of 2023 in addition to telegraphing a less-than-stellar holiday season.While Macy's inventory levels look to be in good shape despite the sales miss, look for the Street to slash their profit estimates for 2023 amid margin pressures and a more cautious consumer. The stock is likely dead money — with a downward bias — until we get evidence of a re-acceleration in consumer spending (for Macy's and other retailers, hopefully this happens before the spring selling season).Story continuesBad fourth quarters and outlooks are probably coming from the likes of Ralph Lauren (RL), V.F. Corp. (VFC), Under Armour (UAA), and other suppliers to department stores. lf Macy's is planning first half orders cautiously, best believe rivals such as JC Penney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), and Dillard's (DDS) are doing the same.The negative comments on Target (TGT) last week from Wells Fargo make even more sense in the wake of this Macy's warning. Target's merchandise skews more discretionary than Walmart's (WMT), putting its numbers at greater risk inside of a sluggish spending backdrop. Along those lines, I agree with the cautious pre-earnings analysis on toymakers Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) — lots of excess toy inventory has been seen post peak holiday season.Macy's called out its cosmetics banner Bluemercury as solid. Walgreens (WBA) also said in its earnings release last week cosmetics performed well. The signs point to another good quarter from Ulta (ULTA).Wall Street's vibe on retailers""Inflation in discretionary retail, apparel, handbags, other accessories, shoes, home goods and electronics probably ran 3% in Q4 2022 and will run that or less in Q1 2023. And, they will finish the year running between 2.5% and 3% inflation. Why? We have oversupply again like we have had for the last forty years, not counting 2020 and 2021. We have reduced demand due to the expiration of COVID emergency funds going into the pockets of the consumer. We have rising interest rates reducing the demand for new mortgages and new mortgages drive the sale of home goods. We are back to 2019. We have at least marginally rising unemployment and marginally falling JOLTS. Inflation in discretionary retail is dead."" -Jan Rogers Kniffen, JK Worldwide Enterprises""Continually softer quarter to date footfall alone suggests 4Q sales could be running below or at the low-end of revenue guidance/forecasts. This trend, in addition to the fact that 1) the key 4Q shopping days are mostly behind us, 2) potentially unfavorable year over year weather is on deck for January (despite the easy Omicron lap), 3) retailers still appear to hold high inventory levels (with goals of being “clean” by year end…), &amp; 4) select retailers/brands have already buckled as it relates to raising discounting activity above 2019 levels, heightens our fears that promotional/discounting activity likely worsens from here. This would subsequently pressure 4Q merchandise margin. That said, we admit elevated promotional/discounting activity feels mostly contemplated in conservative 4Q guidance &amp; consensus estimates, &amp; retailers face an easier GM compare versus 3Q."" -Kimberly Greenberger, Morgan StanleyHave a great week.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:25% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 25% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Given the circumstances, the significant 29% net income growth seen by Vertex Pharmaceuticals over the last five years is not surprising.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Vertex Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 28% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is VRTX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 6% year-to-date, so far. However, with some research, picking out the top-performing stocks for 2023 can set a framework from which to build an investment portfolio that will outperform its peers. Most analysts believe that a potential economic recession will be significantly less severe than the last one. Hence, it’s best to invest in some of the top Dow stocks to buy for the long haul.The names mentioned below are some of the most robust businesses effectively generating incredible free cash flows. These companies have effectively weathered the economic storm this year and continue to march forward with considerable aplomb. Moreover, these stocks are trading at a hefty discount, offering tremendous upside potential.AAPLApple$126.20HDHome Depot$314.00TRVTravelers Companies$186.96CATCaterpillar$239.65CVXChevron$175.36KOCoca-Cola$62.24MCDMcDonald’s$262.15Dow Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockOne of the top Dow stocks to buy is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Its success as one of the most influential technology companies worldwide can be attributed to its closed-loop ecosystem. The integrated system enables Apple to produce lucrative, continuously updated products with the latest software and technologies, demonstrating its commitment to innovation and modernization. Coupled with their impressive financial track record, including a consistent improvement in sales and earnings, it’s no wonder that Apple remains a powerful force in the tech sector.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the news of production issues due to China’s COVID-19 lockdowns, Apple’s position and impressive reputation remain unshakable. Warren Buffet, one of the most decorated investors of all time, has maintained Apple as the largest single holding in his illustrious portfolio. This trust in the company is further evidenced by the fact that its stock is down over 20% from its peak levels at the moment, making it an extremely attractive opportunity for value investors. All signs thus point to this being an excellent period to invest in AAPL stock before the markets recover.Story continuesDow Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comDespite the volatility HD as one of the top Dow stocks to buy, there’s a lot to like about it over the long-term. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is heavily focused on digitalization and sustainability, which puts them in a unique position once the market recovers. The company has also set up an equity line to expand its services and new products for customers. Additionally, Home Depot has taken numerous cost-saving initiatives that have enabled it to increase inventory availability and reduce operating costs. These strategies will help them continue to be a leader within the retail home improvement space even when economic conditions are challenging.With rising interest rates, it is becoming necessary for people to become more involved in DIY projects. The inflationary environment has taken a far larger bite out of real household earnings than normal, thus fostering the need for more DIY projects. As such, it can be viewed as a beneficial situation for Home Depot, which can provide the necessary resources and materials needed to complete them. The cost savings consumers will realize from handyman services repurposed as DIY can turn consumer sentiment and loyalty towards Home Depot, resulting in greater returns for shareholders and prosperity for investors.Dow Stocks to Buy: Travelers Companies (TRV)Red umbrella covering stacks of billsSource: ShutterstockTravelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) is an another one of the top Dow stocks to buy for those wanting to invest in an inelastic enterprise. It has an incredibly strong reach across the United States economy as the second-largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance. With rising rates, this company can be expected to outshine many other stocks as it stands its ground without major problems during booms and busts–great news for investors who are stabilized by security and some assurance that they’ll get a return on their investments. The travel industry is certainly never immune to economic fluctuations and disruption; however, the demand for important insurance policies will remain strong.This is because individuals understand more now than ever that anything can happen in this unpredictable world. The coronavirus pandemic has proven this point beyond a shadow of a doubt as it brought about an unexpected upheaval across the globe. Still, such extreme circumstances may make it difficult for some people to purchase a critical policy – that much must be acknowledged. Nonetheless, travelers can rely on secure, consistent, and predictable entertainment from comprehensive insurance coverage, no matter the volatility of the markets or the state of the economy.Caterpillar (CAT)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is in a strong position to benefit from current economic trends. Washington’s newfound interest in investing in infrastructure projects has been great news for the company, which specializes in providing heavy equipment essential for major building projects. Even better news comes from America’s factory boom, which proves to be an extra lucrative business for CAT, with factories relying on their equipment to keep operations running smoothly. Moreover, the variety of revenue streams makes Caterpillar an appealing proposition for investors seeking profits.The firm had an extraordinary third quarter this year, smashing expectations and setting records for the firm’s performance. It reported a top line of $15 billion and  third-quarter earnings per share of $3.87, an impressive jump from the $2.60 seen a year earlier. Despite challenging conditions with high inflation, operating profits were still able to reach 16.2%, nearly 3% higher than in the third quarter of 2021.Chevron (CVX)For savvy investors, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) looks like an attractive option at the moment. Its recently-released third quarter results highlighted a net profit of $11.2 billion, squeezing it just behind its record-breaking second-quarter earnings this year. Although the company’s profitability was, as expected, affected by lower oil prices, there still remains considerable potential for strong returns in the near future – something investors should certainly consider. Its portfolio of projects and investments is substantial, providing shareholders with much certainty of continued success and stability. Therefore, Chevron appears to be a safe investment choice right now and may bring good returns in the long run.CVX stock has been up over 40% since the start of the year. It’s a remarkable achievement that current investors will likely be celebrating. They have been reaping the rewards of capital gains and enjoy a healthy quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share and a solid yield of over 3%.Coca-Cola (KO)a hand holding a phone hovering over the buy button for stocksCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is an iconic consumer stock that continues to turn heads with its outstanding performances. The legendary Warren Buffet has long been a fan, and his backing provides confidence to investors looking to diversify their portfolios with some big-name stocks. On top of that, Coca-Cola has been increasing its dividends yearly for 60 years now, an impressive feat by any measure and an additional attraction when considering the potential payouts. If I’m looking into consumer stocks right now, Coca-Cola is definitely on my shopping list.Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and many other struggles, Coca-Cola has still managed to bring in strong earnings. Its impressive profit margins are a testament to its tremendous pricing power across the board. Although KO stock may not have been a star performer over the last two years, it’s worth holding for the long haul due to its stellar fundamentals, long-term attractiveness, and consistent track record.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock has proven to be a very rewarding investment for its shareholders over the past 10 years. It has yielded over 13% annual total return in the past decade. It has also demonstrated its commitment to shareholders by paying out $3.92 billion in dividends throughout 2021 and currently offering a yield of 2.30%, making it an attractive choice for anyone looking for reliable dividend income from a sound company with robust future prospects.Despite inflationary pressures hitting everyone’s pocketbooks, McDonalds has managed to remain competitive. On average, the fast food giant has raised prices by 10%, but its third-quarter results demonstrated that it also gained an increasing market share in the low-income consumer sector. That implies that despite price increases, McDonald’s has provided great value and affordability for those with low purchasing power. With these positive results over the past nine consecutive quarters of growth in U.S. same-store and worldwide sales, its pricing strategy is well-founded.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

(NYSE:WM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 86% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-120020259.html,1673265620,STORY,['WM'],"[If you want to know who really controls Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Waste Management already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Waste Management's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Waste Management, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$111m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Waste Management .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

128,1f0d2f27-e2f8-33b1-a2a2-ed0e8480a3da,DVA,2023-01-09,Recent uptick might appease DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) institutional owners after losing 29% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-davita-104709290.html,1673261229,STORY,['DVA'],"[If you want to know who really controls DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 8.5% increase in share prices after a year of 29% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of DaVita, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for DaVita ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About DaVita?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in DaVita. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at DaVita's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in DaVita. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 40%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 53% stake.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of DaVitaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that DaVita Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$52m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 40% of the DaVita shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with DaVita (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To see more such companies, go to 5 Biggest Non-Tech Companies in the World by Market Cap.Easy monetary policies, tech revolution, disposable income and societal changes after the coronavirus pandemic injected a euphoria-like optimism in the technology industry, causing a dramatic rise in tech stock valuations. During the summer of 2020, six major tech companies — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Tesla — accounted for about half of the total value of the NASDAQ 100 index. Trends like work-from-home, internet streaming, online gaming, media and entertainment fueled the growth of tech companies. However, all this optimism around tech and growth stocks came crashing down in 2022 as inflation started to go through the roof and the Federal Reserve decided to begin belt tightening. Major tech companies that were betting big on future technologies like metaverse, AI, machine learning and robotics failed to woo investors and saw billions of dollars erased from their market value as investors flocked to value plays. Major growth investors like Cathie Wood suffered huge losses that are expected to continue this year.Technology companies have now started to lay off employees and cut costs as warning calls for a recession in 2023 grow. According to a layoffs tracking website, there were about 150,000 jobs cuts in the tech industry in 2022. That’s despite the fact that the labor market remained strong in the year. Tech companies are expected to increase the number of layoffs as these firms run out of safety nets. Meta Platforms announced over 11,000 layoffs in November. In the same month, Amazon, which has a reputation of being a major tech recruiter, began its biggest layoff initiative in its 28-year history. This layoff plan is expected to affect about 10,000 employees.Tech companies are expected to remain under pressure until the economy comes back to its normal trajectory.Story continuesPixabay/Public Domain Our MethodologyAs investors look beyond tech stocks and try to find old-school, non-tech companies operating in a diverse range of sectors, we decided to give our readers a basic rundown of some of the biggest non-tech companies in the world. For this article we used stock screeners and manual search to list down the biggest companies in the world outside of the technology industry. After that we picked the top 15 companies from this selection based on market cap. These 15 companies are ranked according to their market cap.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Medicine. The recent pandemic was the best reflection of the advancements in the field of medicine. Vaccines were developed at a lightning-fast pace, with the first vaccine for Covid-19 approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only a year after the outbreak. It was developed by a joint effort of two of the most advanced pharmaceutical companies when it comes to R&amp;D - Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The former is an American company while the latter is German.Other top pharma companies include names like Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN).Due to the medicine industry’s role in the improvement of human well-being, it leads to GDP growth through labor productivity and personal spending. The correlation coefficients for this are demonstrable.  The US, Switzerland and Norway are some of the most advanced countries when it comes to the field of medicine, with huge healthcare spending, numerous pharmaceutical companies and sophisticated academia.OutlookMedicine is one of the fastest growing fields in the world. It encompasses the pharmaceutical industry, medical schools and hospitals. The demand for healthcare is expected to increase due to a variety of factors, such as an aging population and advances in medical technology. According to the Pharma Outlook 2030 by KPMG, many trends are shaping the pharma industry for 2030. For instance, the free-for-service payment model is increasingly being challenged by the end-users, hospitals and insurance agencies. They want the pricing model to be designed around the success and the quality of the product. One of the most prominent results of this is Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI)’s 2016 value-based contracts with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) for cholesterol drugs, with the insurance agencies receiving discounts if their therapies do not reduce cholesterol levels enough. Story continuesAdvances in big data and machine learning are also likely to allow for the pre-emptive measures against the onset of diseases instead of just treating them. Further, machine learning is also set to play a pivotal role in drug discovery.A recent example is the AlphaFold, a deep learning model by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s subsidiary - DeepMind. It has solved 98.5% of human proteins’ structures, an important leap in drug discovery. Priorly, it had been a challenge that had puzzled molecular biologists for half a century. Major advances are primarily happening on the academic front of medicine, and AI in the field is pervasive. For instance, Harvard University researchers have come up with an automated cancer detection system, which uses AI to find breast cancer by examining lymph node cells. Given the trends, AI is largely going to be an integral field to medicine. Another field that is likely to augment the pharma industry by 2030 is nanotechnology. In this regard, Novartis, in partnership with Proteus, has developed a smart pill that can be swallowed for diagnostics purposes. The pharmaceutical manufacturing market is one of the fastest growing in the world. It was worth $358 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a valuation of $1.2 trillion by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 13%, as reported by Precedence Research.On the other hand, the drug-discovery industry was valued at $75 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 9%, to $162 billion in 2030.Lastly, the hospital industry is projected to be valued at $2 trillion by 2028, after a growth with a CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period of 2021-2028. It was valued at $820 billion in 2021.Let’s now move to the 15 most advanced countries in medicine. 15 Most Advanced Countries in MedicinePhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOur Methodology For our list of the most advanced nations in medicine, we’ve ranked them based on three reports. These are the following - Legatum Prosperity Index, 2021, Countries’ Citations in Clinical Medicine, by Institute of Scientific Information, and the CEO-World report of the countries with the best healthcare systems in 2021. Legatum Prosperity Index’s health ‘pillar’ measures the extent to which people have access to essential and advanced healthcare services. The Institute of Scientific Information report, on the other hand, is about the number of citations per paper for countries in the field of clinical medicine. Lastly, the CEO-World report is based on a statistical analysis that accounted for factors such as healthcare infrastructure, government readiness, healthcare professionals and quality of medicine among others. We’ve averaged out the rankings for the top countries in the three reports.

138,bdbe81da-3a04-33fd-a4da-38f3300101f1,UNP,2023-01-09,Investing in Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) five years ago would have delivered you a 67% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-union-pacific-nyse-unp-110045417.html,1673262045,STORY,['UNP'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) shareholders have enjoyed a 50% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 34% (not including dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Union Pacific managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Union Pacific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Union Pacific the TSR over the last 5 years was 67%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Union Pacific shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 13% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 18%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Union Pacific better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Union Pacific is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Cisco Systems'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:29% = US$12b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.29 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 29% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 9.8% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Cisco Systems was able to see a decent net income growth of 20% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 22% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CSCO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Cisco Systems Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?While Cisco Systems has a three-year median payout ratio of 54% (which means it retains 46% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Additionally, Cisco Systems has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Cisco Systems' performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.
