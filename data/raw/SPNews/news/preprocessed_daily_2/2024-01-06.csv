However, a huge development outlay raises the risks of cost overruns and lease-up concerns amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment.', 'Alexandria owns Class A/A+ properties in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and the Research Triangle.These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. Moreover, they are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space. As a result, the company is generally able to command high rents at its properties, aiding steady revenues.The soaring demand for life-science assets on the back of the increasing need for drug research and innovation positions the company well to capitalize on this trend. This will likely drive healthy leasing activity and keep the occupancy and rent growth momentum steady. \xa0In December 2023, ARE signed long-term leases with Novo Nordisk and CARGO Therapeutics at its Waltham mega campus in Greater Boston and San Carlos mega campus in the San Francisco Bay Area, respectively.Also, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools being implemented in this industry, AI-focused life science companies require a significant lab footprint to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to train AI-ML models effectively. This is likely to emerge as a key demand driver for Alexandria’s life-science assets in the upcoming period.Alexandria enjoys a solid tenant base of around 825 diversified, high-quality companies. These tenants mainly rely on a central lab-based infrastructure to optimize their research capabilities and workflow, making it difficult for them to switch locations frequently. This ensures steady rental revenue generation for ARE.In order to enhance its operating platform for long-term growth, Alexandria is focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations. Its pipeline of current and near-term projects is expected to generate annual incremental net operating income of $580 million through the third quarter of 2026, which is encouraging.In addition, as part of the company’s capital-recycling efforts, it aims to achieve dispositions and sales of partial interests target of $1.65 billion in 2023 and is well on track.On the balance sheet front, ARE had $5.9 billion of liquidity as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. It enjoys investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings, respectively, rendering it access to the debt market at favorable rates. Hence, with no debt maturities prior to 2025 and a strong financial footing with ample financial flexibility, the company is well-placed to bank on growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and ARE has remained committed to that. In December 2023, the company announced a 2.4% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2023 cash dividend payout to $1.27 per share. Encouragingly, Alexandria increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.56%. Check Alexandria’s dividend history here.Given the company’s decent financial position and a lower payout ratio compared with that of the industry, the dividend rate is likely to be sustainable in the future.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company, with estimates moving marginally northward over the past week.The company’s shares have gained 28.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 19.8%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Alexandria has a substantial active development and redevelopment pipeline. Although this is encouraging for long-term growth, it exposes ARE to the risk of rising construction costs and lease-up concerns amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty.Given the prevailing high interest rate environment, the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the cost of borrowing will likely be on the higher side. Moreover, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts with high interest rates in place.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Rexford Industrial Realty REXR, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK. While PK sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, REXR and STAG carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rexford Industrial Realty’s 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating a year-over-year increase of 11.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stag Industrial’s 2023 FFO per share stands at $2.28, suggesting year-over-year growth of 3.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Park Hotels & Resorts’ 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $2.03, implying a year-over-year rise of 31.8%.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and advanced technology mega campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, today celebrates the 30th anniversary of its one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-generation company. Alexandria pioneered the novel Labspace® niche and created the first-ever REIT uniquely focused on the critically important life science industry with its founding on January 5, 1994. Over the past three decades, the company has transformed life science real estate from a specialty niche to a compelling mainstream asset class, and it remains the only publicly traded pure-play life science REIT.', '""We are grateful and humbled to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Alexandria\'s founding — a truly monumental milestone that is a testament to our stellar family team\'s operational excellence and dedication to our mission-driven business. It is remarkable to reflect on our astounding growth, from our start in basement offices at Jacobs Engineering to our success in creating an irreplaceable life science real estate platform that dominates the asset class we pioneered,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc./Alexandria Venture Investments. ""Thirty years ago, we saw the remarkable early potential of the life science industry, and today we are honored to be the trusted partner to leaders in this secularly growing industry who rely on our essential Labspace assets to advance and help safeguard their mission-critical work on truly groundbreaking therapies and cures. With over 10,000 diseases known to humankind, nearly 90% of which have no approved treatments, the incredible innovation taking place within our Labspace facilities is and will remain a national imperative. We are immensely proud, as Jim Collins has said, to have \'achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior Results, Distinctive Impact and Lasting Endurance,\' and we will continue to build upon these outputs to transition the company into the next generation.""', ""Alexandria's superior results have been accelerated by its first-mover advantage in the top life science clusters, high-quality Labspace assets aggregated in desirable mega campuses, longstanding tenant relationships and highly experienced team with deep life science expertise. The company's execution of its multifaceted platform of internal and external growth continues to generate outstanding long-term total stockholder return (TSR). From its IPO in May 1997 through December 31, 2023, Alexandria has generated a TSR of 1,512%, significantly outperforming major indices over the same period, including the FTSE Nareit Equity Health Care Index's TSR of 980% and the MSCI US REIT Index's TSR of 792% (assuming reinvestment of dividends). Additionally, Alexandria's growth and sustained performance are supported by its fortress balance sheet with no debt maturities prior to 2025, 99.0% of debt at fixed rates, credit ratings ranking among the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs and significant liquidity of $5.9 billion as of September 30, 2023."", ""For 30 years, Alexandria has been making a distinctive impact as the leader in delivering the complex laboratory infrastructure and fostering the holistic ecosystems needed to enable innovation to advance life-changing treatments and cures. Half of all FDA-approved therapies since 2013 have come from Alexandria's tenants, demonstrating the company's meaningful impact on human health. Alexandria is committed to partnering on endeavors that aim to better manage disease and reduce its economic burden on society, including by addressing two of the country's most prevalent and complex public health issues — addiction and mental health — through its social responsibility pillars. According to CDC data, more than 110,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2022, and suicide deaths reached an all-time high of nearly 49,500. In the face of the opioid epidemic in 2017, Alexandria partnered with Verily to pioneer OneFifteen, a personalized, data-driven care model for treating addiction, in Dayton, Ohio — a city with one of the highest per capita overdose death rates in the nation that year. Alexandria\xa0designed and developed a state-of-the-art campus with a full continuum of care, including medication-assisted treatment, residential housing, peer support and\xa0job placement. OneFifteen has treated over 7,500 patients since opening four years ago. Alexandria has also been partnering with the Navy SEAL Foundation since 2010, enabling the foundation to address the increasing need for specialized physical and mental health programs for Naval Special Warfare personnel and their families. Alexandria is supporting the foundation's new, cutting-edge Warrior Fitness Program West Coast facility in San Diego. The holistic facility provides Navy SEAL warriors and veterans with evidence-based support, advanced technology resources and expert personnel to help them physically and mentally recover and rebuild from injuries and trauma, as well as transition to civilian life."", ""Alexandria was founded on the belief that life science companies are most successful when positioned in the epicenter of top innovation ecosystems proximate to world-renowned academic medical institutions, deep specialized talent and ample risk capital. This belief shaped its cluster model, which it has applied to the life science industry in a disciplined manner to drive the company's lasting endurance. Since 1994, Alexandria has strategically and methodically created the highest-quality life science asset base primarily concentrated in high-barrier-to-entry markets and built the leading life science infrastructure platform. As of September 30, 2023, Alexandria has the strategic optionality to almost double the size of its asset base from 41.5 million RSF of operating properties to 75.1 million SF with assets on balance sheet to continue to meet the unique needs of the vital and secularly growing life science industry."", 'About\xa0Alexandria\xa0Real\xa0Estate Equities,\xa0Inc.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

That echoes the comments of two Apple analysts who downgraded the stock this week on iPhone demand concerns.

But what all this means here for some of these suppliers who rely so heavily on Apple's iPhone sales. We're continuing to see some of that pressure here."", ""Taiwan Semiconductor, one of those names here, Myles, that has been under a bit of pressure this week considering the fact that it gets about a fifth of its annual revenue from Apple.

Skyworks, Corvo, a couple of names that have been down closer to 9%, over 9% over the same five-day period, where we've seen shares of Apple fall 6%. So I think it is a reminder that when Apple sneezes, others catch a cold, to use that old cliche. And we see that here, once again, with these names."", ""But I think the question for the overall Apple ecosystem is no one doubts that they're going to continue to sell millions and millions of iPhones. And that they're going to continue to be the dominant player, at least, in the US market in terms of handset share. And I know we're going to get into this, as we get towards their earnings report at the end of this month. It might be the beginning of February, when we have Dan Howley back on set. But it comes down to what's the hardware innovation timeline for them."", ""We know that the headset is really the main driver in terms of hype like a new piece of equipment for Apple people to get-- Apple consumers, and, of course, the Apple fans to get really excited about, as we get into this year. We've seen the services business continue to be the main driver in terms of revenue growth. Though, it's a smaller overall line item on that top line, it grows faster than the other segments."", ""We had the watch problems at the end of last year. I know they've found some interim solutions to that, but are they creating a new business line around AirPods? I think AirPod Max have been somewhat disappointing. Mine are fine. They fit OK. But I think what they've done with the Beats business. There are a bunch of different questions here just around like your Apple stuff. And this gets into like the old, what do I know thing."", ""Every iPhone is the same. But I'm just a guy.

We certainly did not see the number of crowds or the number of sales, at least, expected that we had initially hoped for, many investors had initially hoped for going into this launch."", ""And then he also brought up the fact that looking ahead to the iPhone 16, at least, from his checks. He doesn't anticipate it to be a heck of a lot different than the reception that we're seeing this time around for the latest model. So taking all of that into account, the fact that it's still so reliant on this one piece of hardware. Yes, they are diversifying their business.

An uptick in the cost of key raw materials partly due to the Russia-Ukraine war has also put pressure on the margins of companies in this space.\xa0 \xa0However, favorable global agricultural fundamentals and healthy farm economics augur well for the industry. Fertilizer players such as CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF and ICL Group Ltd ICL are worth a look, notwithstanding the near-term headwinds.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield. Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and boost the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population drives the consumption of fertilizers.', ""What's Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?"", 'Weaker Fertilizer Prices to Hurt Margins: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the war in Ukraine that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike. However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels due to the weakening of demand. Escalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switching to less fertilizer-intensive crops, leading to demand destruction. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Higher global supply driven by increased global operating rates has resulted in a decline in prices. While fertilizer prices have stabilized somewhat, weaker year-over-year prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.High Input Costs a Concern: A spike in key raw material prices poses a headwind to the companies in this space. Prices of both sulfur and ammonia — key inputs for the production of phosphate — remain elevated. Plant shutdowns and maintenance have led to a tight supply of these raw materials, which, coupled with strong demand, has pushed up their prices. As such, fertilizer makers are likely to face short-term margin pressure associated with higher input costs.Agricultural Fundamentals Remain Favorable: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside. Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs last year, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand. Expectations of high levels of planted corn and soybean acres globally also suggest a pickup in fertilizer demand.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bleak Prospects', 'The Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector.

Investing in real estate or buying dividend stocks is a great way to begin.', 'One super easy way to start collecting passive income each month is to combine those options by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) that pay monthly dividends. Stag Industrial (NYSE: STAG), Agree Realty (NYSE: ADC), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) are three top monthly dividend REITs to buy this January to earn income every month in 2024.', 'Stag Industrial is an industrial REIT that owns warehouses and light manufacturing facilities leased to high-quality tenants. The company pays its investors a $0.1225 per share dividend each month ($1.47 annually). That gives it a 3.8% yield at the recent share price. At that rate, a $1,000 investment in Stag Industrial would produce $3.16 of income each month ($37.90 annually). The more you invest in shares of Stag, the more income you can collect each month. ', ""The industrial REIT has steadily increased its dividend payment over the years, driven by rising rental income and a growing real estate portfolio. Leases across the company's portfolio escalate by more than 2.6% annually, providing it with built-in growth. Meanwhile, it can often capture even higher rental rates when existing leases expire, given the strong demand for industrial real estate in its markets. It recently signed two early lease renewals with a tenant at 49% above the prior rate with a 3% annual rental rate escalation for the life of the 63-month term. "", ""Stag Industrial also routinely acquires hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate each year. It had closed $245 million of deals by the end of the third quarter of last year and had another $67.5 million lined up to close early in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, it had about $3.1 billion of potential deals in the pipeline. Rising rents and acquisitions will increase Stag's rental income, which should allow the REIT to continue growing its dividend. "", 'Agree Realty is a retail REIT focused on owning single-tenant properties leased to tenants in sectors resistant to disruption from e-commerce and recessions. Top sectors include grocery stores, home improvement, and tire and auto services. The company invests in net lease properties and ground leases, which generate stable and steadily rising rental income. ', 'The REIT complements the steady rise in its rental income by making new investments. Last year, it spent over $1.3 billion to add 319 properties to its portfolio. Agree Realty acquired almost $1.2 billion of income-producing properties while investing the rest into development projects, including its developer funding platform. The company entered 2024 with over $1 billion of liquidity, giving it plenty of capital to continue making new investments. ', ""Agree Realty's rising rental income and growing portfolio have enabled it to steadily increase its monthly dividend, which yields 4.7%. It raised its monthly payment by 2.9% in December to $0.247 per share ($2.964 annualized). Agree Realty has grown its payout at a 6.1% compound annual rate over the last decade. "", 'Realty Income owns a diversified portfolio of retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties. The REIT has been steadily expanding into new areas to drive growth. It recently made deals to invest in data centers, launch a credit investing platform, and further expand into Europe. That diversified portfolio generates a very stable and growing rental income. ', 'Realty Income is in the process of meaningfully expanding and diversifying its portfolio by acquiring fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal. The deal will increase its cash flow per share by more than 2.5% in 2024.

The retail REIT, having interests in 13,282 retail single-tenant properties, is often praised for its distinctive dividend growth track record. It has paid 639 consecutive monthly dividends and is a Dividend Aristocrat, boasting 29 years of dividend growth. In fact, I believe that the company’s pace of dividend growth could reaccelerate, moving forward. Thus, I am bullish on the stock.', 'Realty Income’s extensive history of consistently increasing dividends stands as a testament to the company’s enduring success. But what is it exactly that sets Realty Income apart when it comes to its ability to consistently increase its dividend compared to its peers? The answer lies in the outstanding expertise of its management and a conservative capital allocation strategy.', 'Realty Income’s leadership has navigated the company adeptly through various economic climates, emerging stronger even during challenging market conditions, such as the Great Financial Crisis and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Do you remember how retail REITs, in particular, were severely affected during 2020 and 2021, as many retailers were forced to pause their operations? Impressively, not only did the company’s rent collections remain robust, but Realty Income even managed to continue to grow its AFFO per share every year despite the underlying challenges flogging the industry. In particular, Realty Income’s FFO/share in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 landed at $3.30, $3.39, $3.59, and $3.90, respectively.', 'The “secret” to Realty Income’s success is investing in properties utilized by tenants that operate in essential industries. These include grocery (11.4% of annualized contractual rent), convenience (10.6%), drug stores (5.9%), and QSR restaurants (5.3%), among other resilient areas. Thus, most of its tenants are powerhouse, recession-proof firms, exemplified by industry leaders such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), 7-Eleven, and Walmart/Sam’s Club (NYSE:WMT), to name a few.', 'These tenants continued to fulfill their rental obligations even during the pandemic, as their operations were hardly disrupted at the time. But beyond highly reliable tenants, Realty Income also enjoys an extended weighted average lease term of about 10 years. This combination translates into very predictable, multi-year cash flows, allowing management to act prudently on future investments without taking on too much risk. In turn, dividend growth hikes have been very consistent and frequent overall.', 'As I just mentioned, Realty Income has managed to achieve a tremendous dividend growth track record due to the underlying qualities attached to its properties and their tenant/lease profiles. In line with its management’s prudent style, dividend increases have slowed in recent years. Sure, FFO/share continued to rise, but it makes sense to be more conservative during the pandemic and in the face of a rising-rate environment. That said, with interest rates likely to start coming down this year, this trend could flip.', 'For context, even though Realty Income has continued to increase its dividend (even multiple times within each year), the company’s LTM (last-12-month) five-year dividend CAGR (compound annual growth rate) stands at just 3.0%. This is down from 7.3% in the equivalent period in 2017.', 'However, with Realty Income growing its FFO/share at a more significant pace, its payout ratio has been on the decline. It was 89% in 2013, 82% in 2017, and 75% based on this year’s projected FFO/share of $4.11. The below-average payout ratio, combined with the possibility of declining interest rates in the coming quarters, which could further enhance profitability, should allow management to accelerate the pace of its dividend hikes.', 'Realty Income boasts an impressive A3/A- rating from Moody’s and S&P, affirming its solid standing. Notably, the company maintains a robust balance sheet, characterized by a remarkable 96% of unsecured debt and 93% of debt at fixed rates. This underscores the high level of confidence creditors have in Realty Income’s creditworthiness.', 'Further reinforcing this confidence is the extended weighted average term to maturity of 6.6 years for its notes and bonds. This lengthy duration positions Realty Income favorably, aligning with the expectation of falling interest rates by the time the company needs to refinance its obligations. This could prove to be a significant tailwind to Realty Income’s FFO/share as the company continues to scale.', 'Turning to Wall Street, Realty Income stock features a Moderate Buy rating based on six Buys and five Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. The average\xa0Realty Income stock forecast of $60.58\xa0implies 4.95% upside potential.', 'Realty Income’s remarkable track record of consistent dividend growth is a testament to its resilient business model and competent management. The company’s focus on essential industries, reliable tenants, and a prudent capital allocation strategy has shielded it from economic downturns.', 'Despite recent conservative dividend increases, the potential for declining interest rates and a declining payout ratio suggests a future acceleration in dividend growth. Coupled with the fact that shares offer a rather attractive dividend yield of 5.3%, Realty Income remains a compelling choice for income-oriented investors, in my view.', 'Disclosure']"

But while the shiny yellow metal may make a great conversation piece or an interesting piece of art, it’s a pretty awful investment.', 'Here are the details on Costco’s deal – and what a legendary investor says you should buy instead. Plus, we’ll talk about the best way to buy gold.', 'Costco is selling gold ingots – two types actually – priced at $2,070 (as of mid-December). While much of the financial press is using the term “bar” to describe the gold – the word conjures images of Hollywood capers with brick-size hunks of the shiny stuff – “ingot” might be the better term here. For a couple grand, you’re buying all of one ounce of gold – fitting easily in your hand.', 'The company is selling the ingots online-only, not through stores, a nod certainly to the riskiness – to customers and itself – of moving so much value around in a small item. Regardless, they’re selling out within hours of posting or reposting the ingots for sale, says the company.', 'Naturally, Costco’s great reputation can make it easier for those on the fence about buying gold. The retailer has made a commitment to fixed mark-ups on its prices, and consumers may even be able to shave a few percent off the price of the gold ingots via cash-back credit cards.', 'But despite the solid buying experience, gold is a bad investment for a variety of key reasons.', 'When you’re dealing with physical bullion, it’s hard not to get worked over by the dealer you’re buying or selling from. Gold dealers have to build in their own pricing margins because they’re not out here risking money for fun. That means you’re going to pay more than the spot price of gold when you buy and receive less when you sell. Just like when you sell your old car to a car dealer, they’re building in their future profit to the next buyer, not simply buying to use the car.', '“With this event, which has garnered a lot of attention, the people who are probably most likely to generate a positive return are the sellers of the gold to Costco and Costco itself,” says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst, Bankrate.', 'Every time you enter or leave the market for physical gold, you’re paying a significant “spread mark-up” for the privilege of doing so, getting clipped on both sides of the transaction.', 'The spread is evident in Costco’s pricing. With the spot price of gold at $2,018 in mid-December, its gold ingots cost about 3 percent more than the fair, market-determined value of gold. But late last year this spread had been as much as 7.3 percent higher. And when you sell your gold, you’ll likely have to settle for a similar discount or more.', 'You’ll be better off if you work with a reputable bullion dealer rather than a pawn shop, and you don’t want to be in any hurry to sell, since that will tend to lower your final realized price as well.', 'People rightly squawk when they pay similarly huge commissions in other contexts, such as the 5 or 6 percent when selling a home. The thing is, commissions on major investment products such as stocks, ETFs and mutual funds are now down to zero. If you want to see how to get fair value for your gold, continue reading below.', 'If you’re buying gold because you expect to get rich, just stop today. The returns on gold pale in comparison to those on stocks or stock funds over time. While gold may outperform over periods of time, the performance of stocks has been vastly superior – here are the numbers.', 'Below are the key performance figures for two prominent ETFs: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which owns physical gold, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of America’s largest companies.', 'Fund', '1 year', '3 year', '5 year', '10 year', '15 year', 'SPDR Gold Shares', '9.6%', '1.3%', '9.3%', '4.7%', '5.4%', 'Vanguard S&P 500 ETF', '23.8%', '9.9%', '15.0%', '11.9%', '13.9%', 'Over every single period cited, the S&P 500 index fund outperforms the gold fund, which was created to track the price of gold by actually owning physical bullion. In other words, it’s not some fancy gimmicked security that owns something else that’s supposed to move like gold.', 'And the long-term returns are what we’re really after, since anything – Beanie Babies, baseball cards, cryptocurrency – can outperform over short periods of time. On that basis, the S&P 500 index fund has racked up average annual returns of 13.9 percent against the gold fund’s 5.4 percent over the 15-year period.', 'The thing is, the disparity becomes even more stark when you do the math to see what this means in actual dollar terms. If you had invested $10,000 in each fund and held for the whole 15-year period, here’s how much money you’d have before taxes:', 'SPDR Gold Shares – $22,009', 'Vanguard S&P 500 ETF – $70,446', 'That’s a massive disparity, and it’s what you’re giving up by buying physical gold. But to get a fairer measure of owning physical gold yourself (and not just through a fund), you should subtract commissions from the total value, too, perhaps 10 percent, reducing your profit further.', 'Run the same calculations over the 10-year period, and it would look still worse for gold. That’s not to take anything away from the SPDR fund, which we’ll applaud in the next section.', 'Unlike other investments such as stock or ETFs, gold has to be kept safe, and if you’re buying a lot of it, insured. In some extreme circumstances, that could cost significant amounts of money. But even if you have just your novelty ingot of gold, you need to be careful, lest a thief quickly pocket the gold and your entire investment. So it’s not something you want just lying around.', '“My fear for those who are viewing gold bars as something more than an expensive collectible, which is the category I’d put it in, they risk the actual loss or theft of them, as well as the costs associated with mark-ups,” says Hamrick.', 'Of course, like jewelry, part of the enjoyment of owning a gold ingot is looking at its luster and even showing it off to others. It’s a fun novelty, even if a dubious investment. So what a shame that its value might make you too scared to display it and rather hide it away.', 'Still, if you don’t keep your gold safe, then it’s likely to eventually be swiped.', 'For the reasons above, buying physical gold is just not that attractive of an investment. However, if you’re dead-set on investing in gold, then you do have an investment option that eliminates some of the bad points of buying bullion: SPDR Gold Shares.', 'Yes, if you want to wager on the price of gold rising, then a better way to do it is by buying a fund that owns physical gold. The price increases in the fund will track the rise in the commodity, minus the fund’s 0.4 percent expense ratio, which is deducted seamlessly from your fund.', 'Buying this kind of gold fund eliminates the difficulty of getting fair value for your gold, since you’ll be able to buy and sell the fund at the fair market price with no incremental brokerage commissions. Plus, you won’t have to pay out of pocket for keeping the gold safe, though arguably you do that implicitly through the fund’s expense ratio, though it’s reasonably low. (Plus, you have potential other investments in gold that let you win in multiple ways.)', 'However, a gold fund simply doesn’t solve for the key issue of gold’s subpar returns. For that, legendary investor Warren Buffett has long advocated owning shares in productive businesses rather than owning a yellow metal pulled from the ground.', '“What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow,” said Buffett in his 2011 letter to shareholders of his company Berkshire Hathaway. He added: “Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.”', 'Buffett has advised individual investors to purchase shares in an S&P 500 index fund and then to add to the holdings over time. By buying and holding an S&P 500 index fund, investors can enjoy the index’s returns – without having any specialized investment knowledge. This approach makes this kind of fund highly accessible for even novice investors looking for strong returns.', 'Here’s how to buy an S&P 500 index fund and what to look out for.', 'Those looking to find attractive returns from Costco’s sale of gold ingots should carefully understand the downsides of investing in physical gold. An investment in the S&P 500 index has provided much superior returns over time and offers investors the power of diversification, too.', 'Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.']"

This is partly seasonal.', 'But of course, we also have had concerns in the markets of oversupply and also OPEC maybe not having as much influence or power over its members to adhere to their quotas when it comes to production cuts. So OPEC wants production cuts.

Sure, artificial intelligence (AI) has been around in some form or fashion for decades, powering a wide variety of everyday activities. The use of facial recognition and voice-controlled assistants on smartphones, tagging of photos on social media, and even recommendations on streaming video and e-commerce sites all come courtesy of AI. However, generative AI is different, capable of creating original content rather than merely analyzing existing information and using it to draw a conclusion.', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been at the forefront of the generative AI boom, thanks to its sizable investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI and its decision to integrate AI into a broad cross-section of its products and services.', 'However, Microsoft just kicked off the new year by announcing one of its biggest changes in the past 30 years. While the change itself might seem trivial at first glance, it speaks to the growing influence of AI in every facet of everyday life.', ""Microsoft recently announced the debut of Copilot, a suite of AI protocols designed to increase productivity when using the company's products and services. When the company released the results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), it revealed that 40% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Copilot as part of Microsoft's early access program. Soon after, Copilot was made generally available to its enterprise customers, and investors have yet to understand the full impact of AI on Microsoft's results. Access to the technology is about to go much wider."", 'In a blog post published on Thursday, Microsoft announced that it was adding a ""Copilot"" key to the Windows PC keyboard. The new key will enable users to launch Copilot at the touch of a button, further expanding Microsoft\'s growing AI reach. While that might seem important at first glance, consider this: It\'s the first major change to the keyboard since the addition of the ""Windows"" key in 1994.', 'The blog post went further, announcing that it was ""making 2024 the year of the AI PC."" Microsoft also teased big changes ahead, heralding a ""significant shift"" in which AI would be ""seamlessly woven into Windows, from the system, to the silicon, to the hardware.""', 'This helps illustrate the speed at which AI is reaching into every corner of technology and highlights the importance of this paradigm shift.', 'Microsoft recognized the groundbreaking potential of generative AI, as evidenced by its $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The company extended its advantage by quickly integrating generative AI into its most popular products and offering a suite of AI tools via Azure. According to CFO Amy Hood, ""The next-generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.""', 'Much of that growth will come from the cloud. During its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft revealed that it was stealing cloud share from its rivals. Azure revenue grew 29% year over year, outpacing Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet\'s Google Cloud, which generated growth of 12% and 22%, respectively. Digging a little deeper, Microsoft said ""roughly three points"" of Azure\'s growth was due to increased demand for AI services.', ""Azure's cloud growth had experienced seven consecutive quarters of slowing year-over-year growth before the recent uptick, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys. The report also noted the increased demand followed the debut of Copilot in September. This supports Microsoft's contention that AI is at the heart of its current growth spurt."", 'While estimates vary, experts concur that the opportunity represented by AI is vast. One of the more bullish prognostications comes from Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, who suggests that AI software alone could generate $14 trillion by 2030. A much more conservative estimate comes from Bloomberg Intelligence, which suggests that generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%, reaching $1.3 trillion by 2032.', 'Putting the potential size of the opportunity aside, Microsoft has successfully positioned itself to benefit from the growing demand for AI, which will ultimately benefit the company and its shareholders.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

The consumer products company is keen on transforming its business to unleash its full potential. The company is focused on strategic growth pillars, which is noteworthy. That being said, the company is not immune to cost inflation.Let’s delve deeper.', 'Kraft Heinz is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance. In fact, robust pricing strategies have been shielding margin performance amid inflation. In the third quarter of 2023, the company’s organic net sales increased 1.7% on favorable pricing to the tune of 7.1 percentage points — stemming from higher list prices to counter escalated input costs. Adjusted gross margin expanded 396 basis points (bps) to 34%, driven by pricing actions undertaken to offset inflation, solid gross supply chain efficiencies and a favorable mix in North America. The continuation of this trend is likely to keep protecting the company’s margin performance.', 'Kraft Heinz is committed to accelerating its profit and enhancing the long-term shareholders’ value. As part of its transformation phase, management unveiled AGILE@SCALE in February 2022. The strategy helps Kraft Heinz to improve its agile expertise and capabilities via partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators.Management is on track to build its innovation pipeline aided by the Agile Innovation Engine. Strength in Kraft Heinz’s AGILE@SCALE and strategic partnerships are generating solutions throughout the value chain to drive growth and efficiency. As part of the AGILE@SCALE strategy, management is building digital-first solutions to fuel gross efficiencies.Kraft Heinz is benefiting from strength in its three key pillars — Foodservice, Emerging Markets and U.S. Retail Grow platforms. In the Foodservice business, management prioritizes higher margin spaces and undertakes customer-friendly innovations to drive growth. Kraft Heinz’s data-driven and repeatable go-to-market model has been yielding across emerging markets. Strength in the company’s Heinz brand bodes well in such markets.', 'Mondelez has been battling cost inflation for a while now. Although offset by pricing, product mix and lower manufacturing expenses, the company’s adjusted gross margin was affected by escalated raw material and transportation costs in the third quarter of 2023. The adjusted operating margin was also partially hurt by input cost inflation. In its third-quarter 2023 earnings release, Mondelez stated that it still expects a double-digit increase in inflation.Focus on growth endeavors is likely to help Kraft Heinz stay afloat amid such cost hurdles.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have increased 16.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 11.8% growth.', 'MGP Ingredients, Inc.

So stock popping in today's trade, Julie. It sounds like this is about beer sales, by the way. Yeah. Bat beer strong, and that helped offset. It looks like weaker kind of wine and spirits business. So specifically, beer division up 4%. And that includes brands like Modelo, Especial, that was apparently a standout in the quarter."", 'We know that import has been kind of gaining apparently, right? So basically, meanwhile, wine and spirits, though, that was actually down about 8%. And some changes in leadership there, too, we should point out. Vice president, it looks like, Robert Hansen, he kind of led the wine and spirits business there, stepping down effective February 29. And CEO Bill Newlands steps in at least interim responsibilities there.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. The numbers in wine are pretty lousy, right? For the full year, they're looking at-- and they're on a different fiscal year. Their fiscal year ends February 29. They say wine and spirits organic sales are going to fall 7% to 9%. Previously, they thought it would be a range of half a percent drop to a half a percent increase. So that's a big downgrade here. And it makes sense then that they're making that change at the top of the wine and spirits business here."", ""They own brands like Kim Crawford, beloved of one of our producers here for what it's worth. But obviously, not beloved by enough people for it to drive those numbers higher here. So it looks like that the Street is happy that they are making that move though at the top and obviously happy that beer is looking a little bit better for the company as well. And if you look at the comparable sales here, roughly in line with estimates, but it's really the beer thing, the beer business that saved it."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Stocks have about 20% in the past 12 months. And the Street's still bullish on this name, by the way, 22 buys, four holds, no sells."", ""JULIE HYMAN: All right. Let's talk about another one here, Medical Properties Trust. It's falling today after the company said it would record about $350 million worth write-downs related to some of its largest tenants that have fallen behind on the rent. Now Medical Properties Trust is not a company we talk about every day, but it's actually the largest hospital owner in the United States."", ""It buys the properties and then sends the lease them back to the operators of these hospitals. And like many companies within the real estate business was very, very active when rates were low. And now the chickens are coming home to roost, so to speak, because it's some of its tenants are falling-- or its largest tenant in particular is falling behind on its rent. At the same time, MPT is also hiring a restructuring advisor to try and figure out what to do about all of this."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. That was the new, it's basically trying to recover unpaid rents right now outstanding loans to one of its tenants, which reportedly here, this is Steward Health Care System, which is dealing with some challenges. And so Medical Properties Trust decides, OK, we're going to provide you with this $60 million bridge loan. Per Bloomberg, that adds to $50 million of unpaid rent and about $250 million of transactions specific and working capital loans owed by Steward. And a company says, listen, we're going to ultimately reduce our exposure to Steward, but no insurance apparently it's going to be able to recover its claims stock, now down about 70% in the past 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And it's interesting when we talk about the real estate investment trust business as not being a monolith that office is troubled but other parts of it are not. Obviously, this is another area of weakness here with this company."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And remember, about a year ago, there were some headlines flying about these guys. This short seller came out swinging and then lawsuits started flying around here. So tough 12 months for this stock for sure.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Finally, let's check out shares of Synopsys down today in a report. They are in advanced talks to acquire Ansys for around $35 million in a stock and cash deal so this one, apparently, again, we're going to pin this on the Wall Street Journal, they've got the story. Might come together as soon as the middle of next week, could be about $400 per share."", 'Talked about, we know, Julie, we actually talked about this on the show, because it first started getting reported I think in December, right?', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yes, yes.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Synopsys Office makes software, it kind of helps engineers design, test chips. Big customers, by the way, for a company, Nvidia, AMD, Intel.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We've talked to the now CEO of the company Sassine Ghazi a couple of times, who took over from the founder of the company effective January 1st. And this is a company that aims to play eventually more in the AI space. But right now, it's pretty integral when you look at the semiconductor ecosystem because of the testing it does."", ""Ansys in a similar business here, does testing here. And they do have a partnership that they have had since 2017. By the way, I should mention, the company declined to comment on this report here. The Journal by the way also says Cadence Design Systems had approached Ansys with an unsolicited offer. And that sort of sparked this whole situation here between the three companies.

Undoubtedly, there’s a lot of profit-taking at play when it comes to tech stocks, some of which may have run up too far, too fast. That said, the long-term fundamentals and AI tailwinds still seem in play. So, don’t let this sell-off cause you to panic. Many Wall Street analysts stand bullish on high-growth firms (such as SNPS, MDB, and ANET), even if their valuations are a tad on the lofty end.', 'At the end of the day, secular growth warrants higher multiples. Therefore, let’s check TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see how the trio of analyst-approved tech bets stand for this new year.', 'Shares of electronic design automation software (EDA) developer Synopsys are off to an ugly start to the year, with shares now down more than 4% year-to-date, or around 14% from their late-2023 highs. Undoubtedly, 2023 was a big year for Synopsys, which clocked in some robust quarters.', 'Still, the party was drawn short as the firm fell on the back of news of potential plans to acquire engineering simulation software developer Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) in a deal that could be worth “over $400 per share.” Clearly, the market didn’t like the price of admission. As you may know, M&A is not always value-creative. Overpay or overestimate synergies from a deal, and an acquisition can be a destroyer of value.', 'Could it be that Ansys is actually worth more in the hands of Synopsys, or the crowd is missing the true value of the firm? Perhaps. Simulation with a bit of artificial intelligence (AI) sprinkled may be the wild card value driver that most are missing.', 'Indeed, EDA is hard to “get” on its own, let alone AI capabilities alongside EDA. Either way, KeyBanc Capital Markets’ Jason Celino is bullish on the firm’s prospects in the AI age, going as far as to call “AI-enabled design” as the biggest “breakthrough” in several decades. I’m inclined to be bullish as well. The hefty price tag on Ansys may prove to be a bargain when you view it through an AI lens.', 'At 62.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), SNPS stock trades at a rich premium to the infrastructure software industry average of 40.3 times. I believe the premium is warranted, given the EDA play’s potential AI edge.', 'Synopsys stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with nine unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average SNPS stock price target\xa0of $624.44 implies 27.4% upside potential.', 'MongoDB is another big 2023 winner that’s waning in the first few days of 2024, off more than 11%. The NoSQL database software firm recently reported spectacular third-quarter numbers, with revenue soaring by a whopping 29.8%. Despite the solid results, it’s been tough to nudge the stock higher after an incredible run in 2023 that saw shares more than double. Indeed, after such a move, great numbers are already a given, making it tougher to move the needle higher.', 'Though 2023 was a fantastic year, the stock’s been consolidating since its early June surge. And it could stay range-bound if the tech sector continues selling off to start the year. A continued dip in MDB ought to be viewed as an opportunity to buy, at least according to many analysts covering the firm.', 'Investment firm Baird went as far as to name MongoDB one of its top picks for 2024. The rise of generative AI stands out as firms poised to gain from its continued rise as we enter year two of the “AI boom.” After such upbeat comments, it’s hard not to be bullish.', 'At more than 117 times forward P/E (that’s above and beyond the infrastructure software industry average), MDB is not for the everyday value investor. The company is in growth mode, and any hiccups could pave the way for a plunge. That said, it’s hard to bet against a firm that seems to have a front-row seat to the rise of AI.', 'MongoDB stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 21 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MDB stock price target\xa0of $463.52 implies 27.9% upside potential.', 'Arista Networks stock is another tech firm that more than doubled last year but finds itself in a bit of a hole to start 2024. Like MongoDB, Arista also stands to get a shot in the arm from the rise of AI. Just ask Citi’s Atif Malik, who hiked his price target by a whopping $80 just last month to $300 from $220, also naming ANET stock one of Citi’s top tech picks. Malik’s new price target entails more than 30% upside from current levels. That’s a solid gain that has me staying bullish.', 'It’s not just the AI boom that has Malik pounding the table; it’s his belief that the firm’s growth is “sustainable.” I think there’s a high chance he’ll be proven spot-on in 2024.', 'If AI is going to take off, networks are going to have to be up to speed, and that’s why Arista is not a company to count out as AI hype shifts from chips to other corners of the tech scene.', 'At 38.1 times trailing price-to-earnings, the stock is also trading at a hefty premium to the hardware industry average of 27.1 times. Given the AI opportunity, it’s a well-earned premium to the peer group, in my view.', 'Arista stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average ANET stock price target\xa0of $238 implies 3.2% upside potential.', 'Don’t let the weak start to 2024 fool you. infrastructure tech stocks with AI exposure could remain robust through the new year.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, BlackRock Inc. BLK and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'NRG Energy, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates as an integrated power company in the United States. Renewed strength in interest rate sensitive utilities provides a durable backing for this industry leader. NRG stock is displaying relative strength, recently surging to 52-week highs even as the general market has encountered volatility early in 2024. Increasing volume has attracted investor attention as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock.', 'NRG is part of the Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry group, which currently ranks in the top 27% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.', ""Quantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success."", 'NRG Energy is involved in producing and selling electricity and related services to residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers. The company generates electricity using natural gas, coal, oil, solar, nuclear, and battery storage. NRG also provides system power, distributed generation, renewable products, and energy efficiency and advisory services.', 'In addition, NRG Energy trades in electric power, natural gas, and related commodities; environmental and weather products; and financial products including forwards, futures, options, and swaps. The company sells energy, services, and products under the NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain, Stream, and XOOM Energy brands.', 'The utility provider has put together an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in November, the company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.62/share, a 5.88% surprise over the $1.53/share consensus estimate. NRG Energy has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.73%.', 'NRG shares received a boost as analysts covering the company have been increasing their 2024 earnings estimates lately. For the full year, earnings estimates have risen 5.3% in the past 60 days. The 2024 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $5.96/share, reflecting a potential growth rate of 17.9% relative to the prior year.', 'NRG shares have advanced more than 67% in the past year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to experience this type of outperformance. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.', 'Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs, widely outperforming the major indices. With positive fundamental and technical indicators, NRG stock is poised to continue its outperformance.', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, NRG Energy has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and NRG continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.', ""NRG Energy's management continues to approve share repurchases with a $950 million accelerated program currently authorized. A 7-9% long-term target dividend growth rate will also further enhance shareholder value. A positive string of acquisitions over the past several years has resulted in realized synergies that bode well moving forward."", ""Backed by a top industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock."", 'Nutrien produces and sells fertilizers and related industrial and feed products. NTR offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products. Based in Saskatoon, Canada, Nutrien also distributes crop nutrients, protection products, and seeds through approximately 2,000 retail locations internationally.', ""A decline in fertilizer prices is leading to reduced revenues and margins. The company's nitrogen business is also expected to face pricing headwinds in the short-term. Moreover, Nutrien's high debt level poses a concern and raises the risk of a potential default."", 'NTR, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which ranks in the bottom 4% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the past year:', 'Candidates in the bottom tier of industry groups can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in an underperforming industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.', 'Along with many other fertilizer stocks, NTR has been lagging throughout the past year. The share price is hovering near 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market remains volatile to begin the New Year.', 'NTR has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters. The company most recently reported a Q3 profit of $0.35/share back in November, missing the $0.71/share consensus EPS estimate by -50.7%.', 'Over the past four quarters, NTR has delivered an average earnings miss of -28.1%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and Nutrien is no exception.', ""NTR has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking into last year's fourth quarter, analysts have decreased Q4 estimates by -18.37% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $0.80/share, reflecting negative growth of -60.4% relative to the year-ago period."", 'Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.', 'As illustrated below, NTR in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock continues to trade below the 200-day moving average (signaled by the red line). The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.', ""While not the most accurate indicator, NTR has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross', wherein the stock's 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. NTR would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen about 20% in the past year alone."", ""A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to return to its former highs anytime soon. The fact that NTR is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend."", 'A series of 52-week lows indicate that the downtrend is likely far from over. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of NTR until the situation shows major signs of improvement.', 'The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is being considered to become the authorized participant (AP) for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which Grayscale and BlackRock Inc. are planning to launch.', 'Apart from GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is being considered as a potential AP for the ETF. This was first reported by Coindesk.', 'BLK became the first asset manager to file for the spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, paving the way for a wave of filings by other asset managers like Fidelity and Invesco.', ""The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to announce its decision on the trading of spot bitcoin ETF's latest by Jan 10, 2024. To date, the approved cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States are those that include future contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The pending approval from SEC will provide investors direct exposure to the price of cryptocurrency without having to purchase them."", 'BlackRock also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF named iShares Ethereum Trust in November 2023. The Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States.', ""While BLK is expanding its cryptocurrency exposure, JPM has been undertaking measures to subdue them. In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers' access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval."", 'JPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.', 'Beside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.', ""Per an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives' positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term."", 'Further, it has been aiming to expand its offerings across the high growth countries.

This apart, GS believes that deal-making activity in the country is likely to receive a boost.', ""Goldman's shares have gained 16.9% over the past six months compared with the industry's 11.3% growth."", 'GS presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).', ""You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here."", ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

We align our business to this concept by integrating environmental considerations into company-wide processes, continually improving our business practices and delivering tangible, positive results related to the environment.', ""It is our desire to preserve the environment for future generations, as we know the long-term viability of our business and the success of our clients are tied to the health and well-being of our planet. That's why we commit to protecting the environment and mitigating negative environmental impacts from our operations."", ""In managing our real estate portfolio, related procurement and facilities services, Northern Trust's Workplace Services function works to reduce the negative environmental impacts of our supply chain. We use energy to power our data centers and facilities, the majority of which are in North America. As a result, the bulk of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from our North American operations. Since we began tracking our carbon footprint (comprised of the carbon dioxide equivalent of all GHGs produced from our operations), we have improved our data collection processes and calculation methodologies to align with the GHG Protocol."", ""Working closely with our building managers, Northern Trust follows the environmentally friendly building strategies and practices outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. More than 12 percent of our buildings are either LEED- or Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREAM)-certified. In addition, we use tracking programs to monitor and manage our environmental performance and calculate our annual carbon footprint."", 'Realizing that climate impacts threaten more than supply chains and physical infrastructure, we made the commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2050, using our 2019 baseline. As of Dec. 31, 2022, we have reduced the emissions of our business operations by more than 5 percent, and reduced our energy consumption by more than 30 percent. In 2022, Northern Trust worked with Climate Vault to reduce carbon emissions through a two-step approach. Climate Vault first purchases and ""vaults"" carbon emission allowances from government-regulated compliance markets. Because the number of permits is capped, keeping them off the market supports the avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions and provides a quantifiable, verifiable reduction in carbon pollution. Climate Vault will then leverage the value of the emission allowances to fund an equivalent or greater amount of carbon removals from new carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies through a bi-annual grant process. Additional information about our GHG emissions can be found in our Statement of GHG Emissions.', 'We are also continuing to expand the types of emissions on which we report, such as the recent additions of water and waste emissions data.', 'WATER AND WASTE', 'We began gathering data on water consumption and waste in our buildings in 2020. In 2022, 27 percent of our portfolio buildings were able to provide water-use data, representing nearly 48 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtonCO2e)/year. This equates to a total of 59,987 kGal of water, or 2,528 gallons per partner.', 'Water In our Limerick office, flush timers have been added to minimize the volume of water used for flushing. Taps/faucets are also spring loaded to enable automatic shut-off after use. Rainwater is also being collected in a rain barrel, and then used for maintenance of the grounds.', 'Similarly, in Luxembourg, rainwater collectors are being used to reduce water consumption and costs.', 'WasteIn 2022, 6,056 MtonCO2e was associated with waste. This equates to 14,580,765 kg of waste, giving an average of 614kg of waste per partner. Of this 14 million kg of waste- 7 percent was recycled, and 93 percent was trash. At Northern Trust, 31 sites, or 29 percent of total sites, report actual waste data. This is an increase of 4 percent of total sites that reported data versus 2021.', 'In India, all sites have moved to common centralized dustbins to dispose of waste in the office and have reduced approximately 80 percent of plastic garbage liners. Arecanut plates and cups are used in place of Styrofoam items, and Lowooden, single-use cutlery is used as an alternative to plastic. In Limerick and London, paper cups have been removed and replaced with travel mugs for partners. Likewise, in Dublin, paper cups have been replaced with porcelain mugs.', 'In 2022 we have made efforts across the entire portfolio to reduce our single-use plastic. We are more than 50 percent single-use plastic-free, when measured against our benchmark. In 2022, our three Chicago offices made the change from plastic utensils and straws to compostable ones.', 'We are also conducting a trial on the use of plastic free bin liners in some areas. Travel mugs were also given out to partners in our Chicago buildings in an effort to reduce single-use cups.', 'To reduce our water and waste footprint, we will continue to work with facilities teams across our portfolio to expand the number of locations supplying this data for our carbon emissions report.', 'Read the full report here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Northern Trust on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Northern TrustWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/northern-trust Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Northern Trust', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

Because it makes seemingly lofty goals very doable. Suppose you wanted to invest $3,000 and double it. That's very hard to do in a year or two because stocks are unpredictable in the short term."", 'But over time, fundamentals tend to steer the boat. It also breaks the math down. Doubling your money by 2030 requires a 12% annual return (average) for the next six years -- much more doable, right?', ""In other words, find a quality business. Buy the stock at a solid price, and wait. That's it."", 'Here are two stocks that fit the bill.', 'Internet company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), a member of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" has already created immense wealth for its shareholders over the past two decades. Today, the company is a cash flow machine that follows a straightforward recipe for steady earnings growth. Its golden goose is its advertising business. The Google search engine and the video platform YouTube are the Earth\'s two most visited sites. It\'s a vast audience, and it monetizes very well.', 'For every revenue dollar Alphabet brings in, roughly $0.30 winds up as free cash flow, cash profits it can deploy as it pleases. The company has generated $77 billion in cash flow over the past year and sits on $120 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Management loves repurchasing shares. The number of outstanding shares has declined by 10% over the past five years. Fewer shares help increase earnings-per-share (EPS), supporting share price growth.', ""Alphabet's cash hoard all but ensures that management will continue propping up its organic growth with repurchases moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by an average of more than 17% annually over the long term. This clears our targeted 12% by five percentage points, a margin of safety for owning the stock."", ""Additionally, shares trade at a forward P/E of 24, which isn't a bargain but arguably a fair value given the expected growth rate. That's a PEG ratio of 1.3. I consider anything under 1.5 attractive, so unless Alphabet's fundamentals deteriorate, investors should realize enough of the company's growth as investment returns to hit the needed 12% to double their investment by 2030."", ""Streaming pioneer Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has been one of Wall Street's best performers since the stock went public in the early 2000s, appreciating more than 39,000%. No longer the small, emerging lottery ticket it once was, Netflix carries a $210 billion market cap today. Netflix has approximately 247 million paying subscriptions worldwide."", ""It lost money for years, investing to produce its content portfolio so it wouldn't rely on third parties (often its competitors). Today, Netflix owns much of what you see when browsing the platform. Its content has even won Emmy and Oscar awards. Finally, Netflix's profits have outrun its production budget, and the company is a cash cow today. Its $5.6 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters is a strong 22% conversion rate."", ""Netflix stopped allowing password sharing in 2023, and its subscriber growth has accelerated once again. Additionally, Netflix has other growth levers to pull, including international expansion and price increases. Can Netflix someday have 400 million subscriptions? 600 million? It's possible as emerging markets develop the discretionary income to afford streaming. Netflix is in over 190 countries, so it's more about penetrating these markets over the coming years."", ""Analysts also believe the future is bright. Consensus estimates for long-term earnings growth average over 23% annually. Even at a forward P/E of 39, a PEG ratio of 1.6 (a touch expensive) leaves room for Netflix's valuation to come down some and still hit 12% annualized investment returns. Nothing is guaranteed, but Netflix seems like a realistic candidate to double up by the decade's end."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

The Wall Street Journal reporting this morning the company is weighing how to generate some revenue from its gaming services in 2024, stock up about 3/10 of 1%.', 'Currently, Netflix gaming is free to all subscribers. Now, the company may be adding in-app purchases or even charging for some of the more sophisticated games on the platform. Feels like Netflix, anything, sports, live events, gaming, Seana, has been a conversation for many years now. Are they going to find new ways to generate revenue?', ""They kind of just went from 0 to 100 with ads in about, I don't know, nine months maybe. And that's been a successful lever for them to pull from the subscriber growth perspective. We've seen that in the last couple of quarters."", ""We've certainly seen that kind of re-- get investors excited once again in the core Netflix story, which is essentially taking more and more market share in how people spend time with screens in front of their faces, which is how people spend most of their time these days. The gaming one to me-- I don't know. Generate revenue-- it's just less interesting to be like, we would like to generate some revenue from this compared to, again, the success they had with the ads business."", ""And I do sort of wonder if Netflix wants to say we're continuing to innovate in our product roadmap, but it feels like they kind of found the answer, at least for the nearterm with the ad-supported tiers."", 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I do agree with that, and especially just because of the fact that when you take a look at the numbers at least released from Apptopia and some of the other data firms that track at least what they think the user base looks like, it only accounts for about 1% right now. Gamers account for about 1% of the users. So very, very small fraction.', 'So exactly to your point in terms of how big of a revenue driver. This is going to be at least in the medium term or immediate term, I should say, excuse me, given those low numbers clearly not going to be anything that investors are going to really change their investment thesis on.', ""But I do think it points to a fact that if this is relatively easy or an easy hurdle here to get over, able to monetize something, that people are starting to use, that's becoming a bigger story within the Netflix playbook here going forward. We've heard executives talk about this time and time again, just their emphasis and what they look to see in terms of growth opportunity here for games."", ""So now they look to monetize it. It's obviously further diversifying their revenue stream, adding another source of revenue here. In the immediate term, though, nothing huge. What these numbers could look like maybe in the longer term, again, unlikely to ever be in comparison to what we've seen from the ad-supported tier. But it could be another reason for investors to be more bullish on this."", 'MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I\'m just-- first, I\'m hearing there\'s a ""Too-Hot-to-Handle"" game.', ""SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I've never played the game."", 'MYLES UDLAND: But it\'s like-- no-- but I guess maybe I\'m not being excited enough about the support, but it is kind of like media empire building 101, right? I mean, it\'s the Mel Brooks bit from ""Spaceballs,"" right? We\'re going to do the lunch boxes, then we\'re going to do the games. We\'re going to do the licensing.', ""So you have a show, it's successful, you make a game, you do a bunch of other stuff. And so here we go. And you make-- you charge money for it. You make money from it."", 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah']"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, BlackRock Inc. BLK and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:', 'NRG Energy, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates as an integrated power company in the United States. Renewed strength in interest rate sensitive utilities provides a durable backing for this industry leader. NRG stock is displaying relative strength, recently surging to 52-week highs even as the general market has encountered volatility early in 2024. Increasing volume has attracted investor attention as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock.', 'NRG is part of the Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry group, which currently ranks in the top 27% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.', ""Quantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It's no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success."", 'NRG Energy is involved in producing and selling electricity and related services to residential, commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers. The company generates electricity using natural gas, coal, oil, solar, nuclear, and battery storage. NRG also provides system power, distributed generation, renewable products, and energy efficiency and advisory services.', 'In addition, NRG Energy trades in electric power, natural gas, and related commodities; environmental and weather products; and financial products including forwards, futures, options, and swaps. The company sells energy, services, and products under the NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain, Stream, and XOOM Energy brands.', 'The utility provider has put together an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in November, the company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.62/share, a 5.88% surprise over the $1.53/share consensus estimate. NRG Energy has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.73%.', 'NRG shares received a boost as analysts covering the company have been increasing their 2024 earnings estimates lately. For the full year, earnings estimates have risen 5.3% in the past 60 days. The 2024 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $5.96/share, reflecting a potential growth rate of 17.9% relative to the prior year.', 'NRG shares have advanced more than 67% in the past year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to experience this type of outperformance. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.', 'Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs, widely outperforming the major indices. With positive fundamental and technical indicators, NRG stock is poised to continue its outperformance.', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, NRG Energy has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and NRG continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.', ""NRG Energy's management continues to approve share repurchases with a $950 million accelerated program currently authorized. A 7-9% long-term target dividend growth rate will also further enhance shareholder value. A positive string of acquisitions over the past several years has resulted in realized synergies that bode well moving forward."", ""Backed by a top industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock."", 'Nutrien produces and sells fertilizers and related industrial and feed products. NTR offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products. Based in Saskatoon, Canada, Nutrien also distributes crop nutrients, protection products, and seeds through approximately 2,000 retail locations internationally.', ""A decline in fertilizer prices is leading to reduced revenues and margins. The company's nitrogen business is also expected to face pricing headwinds in the short-term. Moreover, Nutrien's high debt level poses a concern and raises the risk of a potential default."", 'NTR, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Fertilizers industry group, which ranks in the bottom 4% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the past year:', 'Candidates in the bottom tier of industry groups can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in an underperforming industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.', 'Along with many other fertilizer stocks, NTR has been lagging throughout the past year. The share price is hovering near 52-week lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market remains volatile to begin the New Year.', 'NTR has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters. The company most recently reported a Q3 profit of $0.35/share back in November, missing the $0.71/share consensus EPS estimate by -50.7%.', 'Over the past four quarters, NTR has delivered an average earnings miss of -28.1%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and Nutrien is no exception.', ""NTR has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking into last year's fourth quarter, analysts have decreased Q4 estimates by -18.37% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $0.80/share, reflecting negative growth of -60.4% relative to the year-ago period."", 'Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.', 'As illustrated below, NTR in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock continues to trade below the 200-day moving average (signaled by the red line). The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.', ""While not the most accurate indicator, NTR has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross', wherein the stock's 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. NTR would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen about 20% in the past year alone."", ""A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to return to its former highs anytime soon. The fact that NTR is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend."", 'A series of 52-week lows indicate that the downtrend is likely far from over. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of NTR until the situation shows major signs of improvement.', 'The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is being considered to become the authorized participant (AP) for the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which Grayscale and BlackRock Inc. are planning to launch.', 'Apart from GS, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is being considered as a potential AP for the ETF.

To date, the approved cryptocurrency ETFs in the United States are those that include future contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The pending approval from SEC will provide investors direct exposure to the price of cryptocurrency without having to purchase them."", 'BlackRock also filed for a spot Ethereum ETF named iShares Ethereum Trust in November 2023. The Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States.', ""While BLK is expanding its cryptocurrency exposure, JPM has been undertaking measures to subdue them. In September 2023, JPM stated that its retail bank, Chase, in the U.K. had decided to restrict customers' access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scams and fraud cases. Nonetheless, it has been exploring the concept of launching a blockchain-based deposit token for customers, provided it receives the required regulatory approval."", 'JPMorgan and Goldman as APs for spot Bitcoin ETF would be entrusted with the responsibility of tracking the ETF share price with underlying assets of fund. The companies will be required to create and redeem the shares of ETF, thus supplying the required liquidity.', 'Beside this, Goldman has been focusing on growth in its core strengths of investment banking and trading since it has been pulling back from its consumer lending business. Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion.', ""Per an internal memo circulated last year, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives' positions as it intended to expand its operations in the private credit space.

While the company’s revenues are expected to have witnessed an increase in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, earnings are likely to have declined.In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in net interest revenues (NIR) and lower expenses. The assets under management (AUM) balance witnessed a rise, which, along with marginally higher fee revenues, was another positive.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 8.7%, on average.', '\xa0', 'The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.11, which has been unchanged over the past seven days. The consensus estimate indicates a decline of 14.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.09 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.28 billion, implying a 9.3% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $4.26 billion.', 'Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.21 billion, suggesting a rise of 1.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $2.26 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 4.1%.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $45.86 million, which suggests a 6.7% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $45.6 million, indicating a rise of 6%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $37.24 million, implying a 12.8% rise from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $34.4 million.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $154 million, suggesting a decline of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $143 million, indicating a 24.7% decline.Thus, the consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.29 billion, suggesting a rise of 15.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We also project the metric to be $3.29 billion.Net Interest Revenues: The overall lending scenario has been weak in the to-be-reported quarter amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.While interest rates remained high in the fourth quarter, higher funding costs are likely to have put pressure on interest income growth, as well as margins. Moreover, at its December 2023 meeting, the Federal Reserve paused rate hikes and indicated no further rate increases in the near term.Thus, due to weak loan demand, BK’s interest income is likely to have been negatively impacted in the quarter under review. Also, higher funding and deposit costs are likely to have put pressure on margin growth.The consensus mark for fourth-quarter NIR is pegged at $983 million, indicating a 6.9% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for NIR is pinned at $965.7 million.For 2023, management expects NIR to grow 20% year over year.Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Our estimate for fourth-quarter non-interest expenses is $3.13 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 2.4%.Management expects full-year expenses (excluding notable items) to increase almost 4% year over year.', 'According to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is -1.31%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.', 'A couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.28 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.01% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?', ""For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.31%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.27, delivering a surprise of +11.40%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

And management believes its stock is undervalued as well. The company had an existing authorization plan in place for share repurchases, with the ability to repurchase 1 million shares. However, in November, it added $5 billion in authorization.', ""It's possible, if not likely, that Expedia's management was repurchasing shares during December.

On Dec. 5, the company announced that it had landed new travel partners in Europe, which could help its business grow more."", 'Compared to comparable companies Booking Holdings and Airbnb, Expedia stock looks cheap from a free-cash-flow perspective.

But it's not -- as Q3 results demonstrated, business is good. And there are reasons to be encouraged moving forward."", 'Specifically, Expedia just united its loyalty program across its various platforms, which include the Expedia platform and Vrbo. It will be interesting to watch if this unified loyalty program can drive traffic across the various brands under its umbrella.', ""Therefore, it's understandable why Wall Street was upbeat about the stock in December and why Expedia's management was likely aggressively repurchasing shares.

But there have been significant changes to the U.S. space industry since ULA's formation in 2006, when it was created to dominate government launches and clinch some commercial demand from the then-nascent satellite market."", 'Growth of the commercial market was slower than expected, said Richard McKinney, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Air Force\'s space acquisition unit until 2007. ""But it looks like we\'re about there now.""', ""Amazon's planned Kuiper network is set to bring in crucial launch revenue for ULA. That has helped provide Vulcan with a multibillion-dollar backlog of roughly 70 missions split somewhat evenly between government and commercial customers, Bruno has said."", ""Vulcan's development and ULA's shift away from its Atlas and Delta rockets have made estimates of the company's valuation hard to pin down, but analysts speculate it could be $2 billion to $3 billion."", 'Boeing and Lockheed each have their own competing space units. Lockheed, among other pursuits, has ventured into building moon rovers and made strategic investments in ABL Space, a small-launch startup with plans to build larger rockets in the future.', ""Boeing's space program has struggled, primarily with its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule that rivals SpaceX's more established Crew Dragon. Troubles with Starliner development have cost Boeing some $1.5 billion since 2014."", 'New ownership could allow ULA to innovate beyond the launch sector in ways its corporate parents were unwilling to allow, former ULA chief scientist Sowers said.', '""The charter of the company was fixed, and it was very limiting,"" he said.

If you want to skip our discussion on the drug crisis, you can go directly to the 5 States With The Highest Drug Overdose Death Rates In The US.', 'In the 12-month period ending in July 2023, over 106,000 Americans lost their lives due to drug overdoses, marking a slight decrease compared to the previous year. The reported figure reflects a 1% reduction from the 107,747 overdose-related deaths recorded in the 12-month period ending July 2022. The decline raises questions about potential underreporting or signals a positive shift due to governmental policies and intervention efforts. The United States recorded a continuous annual rise in drug overdose deaths until 2021, after which a decline has been observed. The drug overdose death toll crossed 100,000 in 2021 during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase in the death rates was influenced by disruptions in medical care, higher mental distress, and the widespread availability of certain drugs. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), around 91 million Americans resided in areas facing a shortage of mental health professionals in 2021. With the rates of depression and anxiety rising and the lack of mental health support, individuals turned to substances as a means of reducing their distress.', 'Across states, Washington witnessed the most significant percentage increase in overdose-related deaths, rising by 38.5% between July 2022 and July 2023. In contrast, North Carolina experienced the most substantial decline, with a 23.4% decrease in drug overdose deaths. Meanwhile, Illinois and New York were among the states with the highest drug overdose death rates in the US in 2023. The highest number of deaths reported in 2023 was due to opioids, with opioids responsible for 76% of total overdose-related deaths in the country. This number was slightly lower than the 80% opioid-related deaths predicted for the 12 months ending in July 2023. You can also check out the 20 Cities with the Highest Opioid Deaths in the U.S. here. On the other hand, the reported number of drug overdose deaths involving psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and synthetic opioids (including fentanyl but excluding methadone) saw a significant increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Meanwhile, heroin overdoses witnessed a decline, dropping from 7,066 in July 2022 to 4,542 in 2023 across the country.', ""Pharmaceutical Industry's Role in the Opioid Epidemic"", ""Drug overdose remains a significant contributor to both fatal and non-fatal accidents and injuries, with opioids and stimulants being responsible for the highest number of casualties. Several pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for promoting the use of opioids, leading to addiction. In 2019, Purdue Pharma settled a lawsuit filed by the state of Oklahoma for $270 million, alleging the company's responsibility for thousands of deaths in the state. Purdue Pharma, having paid millions in settlements over the past two decades, has now declared bankruptcy."", 'Four other pharmaceutical companies collectively paid a sum of $26 billion in 2022 to settle lawsuits holding them responsible for the worsening opioid epidemic in the US. These companies include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Cencora Inc (NYSE:COR) (formerly known as AmerisourceBergen), Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH), and McKesson (NYSE:MCK). Johnson & Johnson, a health-tech giant with a global presence, faced controversies not only related to opioids but also concerning harmful ingredients in baby products. In 2022, the company paid $5 billion in a nationwide settlement, which was utilized for healthcare and drug treatment programs. Despite announcing the suspension of opioid production in 2020, it was only after the lawsuit settlement in 2022 that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stopped selling prescription opioid medicine in the United States. This collective effort by states and federal bodies held major pharmaceutical companies accountable for the devastating opioid epidemic. The billions received in settlements have provided support to rehabilitation programs and treatment facilities for substance abuse and addiction. This collaborative action is believed to be a contributing factor to the noticeable decline in the number of opioid-related deaths in the country in the past year.', ""Here's what ClearBridge Investments said about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“The health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large cap pharmaceutical company\xa0Johnson & Johnson\xa0(NYSE:JNJ).

Per EOG Resources, production is not expected to maintain the same growth rate as the preceding year.', 'According to U.S. government estimates, U.S. oil production hit a record peak of 13.25 million barrels per day in September.

This downturn is, in part, linked to a decrease in active drilling rigs, which dropped 20% in 2023.', 'Oil drillers in areas like the Permian Basin and Bakken Shale exceeded analysts’ expectations last year by increasing oil production.

The company intends to sustain activity at its Dorado natural gas play in South Texas, even though it postponed some completions there last year due to low natural gas prices.', 'The slowdown in growth is mostly due to a reduction in drilling within the country.

""It\'s really the future of their company.""', ""The debut mission is a long-awaited milestone after months of various delays in the final stretch of Vulcan's development, and following a testing mishap last year with a Vulcan upper-stage booster. ULA CEO Tory Bruno has said that Vulcan has performed well during recent ground tests."", '""That is an incredibly complicated machine, it\'s tremendously powerful. Everything has to work,"" Bruno said Saturday at Vulcan\'s launch pad. ""It is always inherently risky to fly a rocket. But what we\'re good at is managing that risk.""', ""The mission checklist includes carrying a moon lander that is aiming to make the first U.S. lunar soft landing in half a century. The rocket will be using for the first time engines supplied by Jeff Bezos' space firm Blue Origin."", ""Vulcan's launch also comes as Boeing and Lockheed, which formed ULA in a 2006 merger of their rocket programs, are looking to sell the jointly owned venture, according to three people familiar with the talks."", ""The talks have been a complex, drawn-out process for which Vulcan's launch could have crucial implications, said the sources, who asked not to be identified."", 'ULA declined to comment on any potential deal talks. Bruno has previously said his company could be ripe for an acquisition.', 'Boeing and Lockheed declined to comment.', ""Vulcan's debut launch, scheduled for 2:18 a.m. ET (0718 GMT) on Monday, is the culmination of a years-long development effort sprung largely from ULA's need to replace its current Atlas V rocket. That rocket's Russian-imported engines drew criticism from lawmakers that led to its planned retirement."", ""The retirement of Atlas - plus Vulcan's other rocket, Delta - will leave the 200-foot-tall (60-m) Vulcan to handle dozens of lucrative missions and serve as the company's sole challenger to SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9."", ""Vulcan's debut mission will send a privately built lander from space robotics firm Astrobotic to the moon. But the launch itself will also serve as the first of two certification flights required by the U.S. Space Force before Vulcan can fly Pentagon satellites."", ""Space Force is a core customer for Vulcan - the military branch in 2020 picked ULA's Vulcan and its retiring Atlas V to launch 60% of the Pentagon's missions through around 2027."", ""Priced lower than its predecessors at roughly $110 million per launch, Vulcan will seek to reclaim market share from Falcon 9, which is priced at roughly $62 million per launch. SpaceX's cheaper flights have eroded ULA's dominance of government satellite launches in the past decade."", ""Vulcan will also compete with Blue Origin's forthcoming New Glenn rocket, which uses the same engines as Vulcan."", 'ACQUISITION TALKS', 'Acquisition talks for ULA have been underway for more than a year, with dozens of firms, including Blue Origin, having expressed interest, the sources said.', 'Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment.', ""Boeing's and Lockheed's rationale and timing for selling ULA are unclear. But there have been significant changes to the U.S. space industry since ULA's formation in 2006, when it was created to dominate government launches and clinch some commercial demand from the then-nascent satellite market."", 'Growth of the commercial market was slower than expected, said Richard McKinney, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Air Force\'s space acquisition unit until 2007. ""But it looks like we\'re about there now.""', ""Amazon's planned Kuiper network is set to bring in crucial launch revenue for ULA. That has helped provide Vulcan with a multibillion-dollar backlog of roughly 70 missions split somewhat evenly between government and commercial customers, Bruno has said."", ""Vulcan's development and ULA's shift away from its Atlas and Delta rockets have made estimates of the company's valuation hard to pin down, but analysts speculate it could be $2 billion to $3 billion."", 'Boeing and Lockheed each have their own competing space units. Lockheed, among other pursuits, has ventured into building moon rovers and made strategic investments in ABL Space, a small-launch startup with plans to build larger rockets in the future.', ""Boeing's space program has struggled, primarily with its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule that rivals SpaceX's more established Crew Dragon.

On shares rallied more than 50% in 2023 on what will likely end up being top-line growth of nearly 58%. Conversely, Nike shares tumbled a bit, dragged down by tepid sales growth and a surprise mid-year earnings miss. Analysts' current views of each company suggest more of the same disparity is in the cards."", ""Given the choice between the two right now, however, I'd pick a new position in Nike stock over opening one in On Holding. Nike has more net upside, largely because too many people are looking at the recent past rather than the foreseeable future. Nike boasts four distinct bullish arguments that set the stage for a better 2024."", ""Don't misread the message. Investors have good reason to be a bit suspicious of Nike right now. A superficial glance at its results from its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ended in November) indicates revenue only grew 1%, for instance. The athletic apparel brand also dialed back its full-year sales outlook, pointing to intensifying macro headwinds."", ""Digging deeper into the details of that Q2 report and then putting them in their proper context, however, suggests that many of the problems that have been standing in the company's way of late are now abating or soon will. Four of these impending changes stand out from the rest."", 'Nike is an international brand. But its single-biggest market is North America, where sales fell by 4% year over year last quarter. The importance of this market augmented the impact of that setback.', ""There's a critical detail worth noting here, however. Many of Nike's retail partners have been closing up shop, or are at least restructuring their businesses. Foot Locker, for example, announced early last year that it would begin the closure of up to 400 of its namesake stores plus another 125 of its Champs Sports locations in a sweeping rebranding and rightsizing effort. Eastbay, Foot Locker's direct-mail operation, also ceased operations at the end of 2022."", ""Meanwhile, Maine-based Olympia Sports began shuttering its stores in 2022, and bankrupt Shoe City also called it quits last year, closing down another 39 selling venues. These moves are emblematic of the bigger struggle the retail side of the athletic shoe business is facing at this time. So is Nike's 2% year-over-year constant-currency decline in last quarter's wholesale revenue."", ""Last year was a bit of an anomaly for retailing, though. Many retailers had loaded up on inventory in anticipation of a post-pandemic rebound only to find out that demand -- and even foot traffic -- just wasn't bouncing back as robustly as expected. The fact that so many people are still working from home didn't help either."", ""It's a reckoning, however, that likely peaked in 2023. In fact, the headwind may well fizzle out altogether in 2024."", ""The slow erosion of traditional retailing is being offset by brands' own brick-and-mortar and e-commerce growth. Nike is no exception to this trend. Revenue generated by its own stores improved 4% year over year during the quarter ending in November, while digital sales were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis."", ""Those numbers alone aren't thrilling. But, they're phenomenal on a two-year stacked basis. In the same quarter a year earlier Nike's direct revenue grew 16%, and its online sales improved by a whopping 25% year over year. Those results were a tough act to follow."", ""More important, with about 40% of the company's top line now coming from its own direct sales channels, any future slow-down of third-party retailing is less and less of a problem."", 'Of course, anyone keeping close tabs on Nike for the past couple of years likely recognizes that owning and operating its own stores and online shopping app has presented problems of its own. Specifically, Nike carried a swelling level of inventory in fiscal 2022 that forced major margin-crimping markdowns in fiscal 2023.', 'For perspective, the company ended its fiscal 2022 with inventories of $8.4 billion, up 23% from the same point in time a year earlier. And this inventory bloat worsened last year. End result? Big-time markdowns. Gross margins fell from 46% a year before to 43.5% in the fiscal year ending in mid-2023 -- a ton of money by retailing standards -- as the company sought to shed aging merchandise that was simply getting in the way.', ""This lingering problem, however, finally appears to be resolving. Last quarter's inventory of just under $8 billion was not only down 14% year over year, but was the lowest inventory level the company had reported since early 2022, when the industry first began buying up goods for the consumerism rebound that never fully materialized."", ""Now that its supply is much leaner, profit margins should widen again. Indeed, they'll widen even more now that direct sales and its in-house e-commerce operation account for a bigger piece of its total business."", ""Last but certainly not least, although the past couple of calendar years haven't been stellar ones for Nike, it's still a solid brand name that consumers demand. Brand consulting outfit Interbrand ranks Nike as the seventh-best global brand name of 2023, one spot behind Coca-Cola and two spots ahead of McDonald's. That's impressive."", 'Meanwhile, Nike remains a worldwide market leader in sports apparel, and controls roughly half of the global athletic footwear market, according to data compiled by Statista.This is no small matter.', ""Consumers have a tendency to purchase products made by brands they know and have likely purchased before. That's why it's so difficult to dethrone a market leader once it has established itself. And such companies can often afford to spend enough to ensure they remain ahead of their most threatening rivals."", ""Speaking of that task, newly named Chief Marketing Officer Nicole Hubbard Graham is the right person for the job of helping Nike maintain its lead. She was with Nike for 18 years before leaving in 2021 to help found an ad agency that counted Gatorade, Netflix, and Lululemon Athletica among its clients.

So stock popping in today's trade, Julie. It sounds like this is about beer sales, by the way. Yeah. Bat beer strong, and that helped offset. It looks like weaker kind of wine and spirits business. So specifically, beer division up 4%. And that includes brands like Modelo, Especial, that was apparently a standout in the quarter."", 'We know that import has been kind of gaining apparently, right? So basically, meanwhile, wine and spirits, though, that was actually down about 8%. And some changes in leadership there, too, we should point out. Vice president, it looks like, Robert Hansen, he kind of led the wine and spirits business there, stepping down effective February 29. And CEO Bill Newlands steps in at least interim responsibilities there.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. The numbers in wine are pretty lousy, right? For the full year, they're looking at-- and they're on a different fiscal year. Their fiscal year ends February 29. They say wine and spirits organic sales are going to fall 7% to 9%. Previously, they thought it would be a range of half a percent drop to a half a percent increase. So that's a big downgrade here. And it makes sense then that they're making that change at the top of the wine and spirits business here."", ""They own brands like Kim Crawford, beloved of one of our producers here for what it's worth. But obviously, not beloved by enough people for it to drive those numbers higher here. So it looks like that the Street is happy that they are making that move though at the top and obviously happy that beer is looking a little bit better for the company as well. And if you look at the comparable sales here, roughly in line with estimates, but it's really the beer thing, the beer business that saved it."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Stocks have about 20% in the past 12 months. And the Street's still bullish on this name, by the way, 22 buys, four holds, no sells."", ""JULIE HYMAN: All right. Let's talk about another one here, Medical Properties Trust. It's falling today after the company said it would record about $350 million worth write-downs related to some of its largest tenants that have fallen behind on the rent. Now Medical Properties Trust is not a company we talk about every day, but it's actually the largest hospital owner in the United States."", ""It buys the properties and then sends the lease them back to the operators of these hospitals. And like many companies within the real estate business was very, very active when rates were low. And now the chickens are coming home to roost, so to speak, because it's some of its tenants are falling-- or its largest tenant in particular is falling behind on its rent. At the same time, MPT is also hiring a restructuring advisor to try and figure out what to do about all of this."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. That was the new, it's basically trying to recover unpaid rents right now outstanding loans to one of its tenants, which reportedly here, this is Steward Health Care System, which is dealing with some challenges. And so Medical Properties Trust decides, OK, we're going to provide you with this $60 million bridge loan. Per Bloomberg, that adds to $50 million of unpaid rent and about $250 million of transactions specific and working capital loans owed by Steward. And a company says, listen, we're going to ultimately reduce our exposure to Steward, but no insurance apparently it's going to be able to recover its claims stock, now down about 70% in the past 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And it's interesting when we talk about the real estate investment trust business as not being a monolith that office is troubled but other parts of it are not. Obviously, this is another area of weakness here with this company."", 'JOSH LIPTON: And remember, about a year ago, there were some headlines flying about these guys. This short seller came out swinging and then lawsuits started flying around here. So tough 12 months for this stock for sure.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, definitely.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Finally, let's check out shares of Synopsys down today in a report. They are in advanced talks to acquire Ansys for around $35 million in a stock and cash deal so this one, apparently, again, we're going to pin this on the Wall Street Journal, they've got the story. Might come together as soon as the middle of next week, could be about $400 per share."", 'Talked about, we know, Julie, we actually talked about this on the show, because it first started getting reported I think in December, right?', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yes, yes.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Synopsys Office makes software, it kind of helps engineers design, test chips. Big customers, by the way, for a company, Nvidia, AMD, Intel.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We've talked to the now CEO of the company Sassine Ghazi a couple of times, who took over from the founder of the company effective January 1st. And this is a company that aims to play eventually more in the AI space. But right now, it's pretty integral when you look at the semiconductor ecosystem because of the testing it does."", ""Ansys in a similar business here, does testing here. And they do have a partnership that they have had since 2017. By the way, I should mention, the company declined to comment on this report here. The Journal by the way also says Cadence Design Systems had approached Ansys with an unsolicited offer. And that sort of sparked this whole situation here between the three companies.

Nonetheless, due to home price appreciation, origination volumes (both purchase and refinancing) remained lower than the prior quarter.', 'Hence, being one of the preeminent bank mortgage lenders in the United States, WFC is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income in fourth-quarter 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s fourth-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $187 million, implying a 3.1% fall on a sequential basis.', 'Wells Fargo’s investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of weak fixed-income market performance. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activities are expected to have been headwinds. The consensus mark for investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues is pegged at $2.18 billion, implying a sequentially rise of 1.7%.', 'In the quarter under review, the investment banking (IB) business showed a turnaround from the discouraging performance in the prior three quarters. Green shoots were observed in the capital markets and issuance activities. The major factor driving a better picture was the stabilizing interest rate environment.', 'This is expected to have affected WFC’s IB fees. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $487 million, suggesting a 1% decline from the prior quarter’s reported number.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s total non-interest income is pegged at $7.50 billion, suggesting a 3.2% decline from the prior quarter’s reported number.', 'Expenses:\xa0Wells Fargo’s costs are expected to have continued to flare up in the fourth quarter, given its franchise investments in technology and digitalization efforts. Additionally, severance expenses related to job cuts are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.', 'The company is expected to have kept aside $750 million to less than $1 billion for severance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'Also, non-interest expenses for 2023, excluding operating losses, are anticipated to be $51.5 billion.', 'Asset Quality:\xa0With expectations of an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, Wells Fargo’s credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Moreover, given the heightened market volatility, commercial loan defaults are expected to have risen. Hence, as WFC has substantial exposure to commercial loans, it is likely to have set aside reserves in the fourth quarter.', 'The consensus mark for total non-accrual loans is pegged at $8.51 billion, implying a sequential rise of 6.4%.', 'According to our quantitative model, the chances of WFC beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?', ""For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -13.78%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wells Fargo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $1.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.39, delivering a surprise of +11.20%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Unfortunately, those yields often come with unacceptable trade-offs in the form of significant risk and/or low overall growth prospects. That's not always the case, though."", ""Three Motley Fool contributors think they've found some magnificent high-yield dividend stocks to buy in 2024. Here's why they picked AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (AbbVie): Every good thing must come to an end. AbbVie learned that lesson the hard way last year when its blockbuster immunology medicine Humira ran out of patent protection in the U.S. The result was a steep decline in the company's sales and a rather unimpressive stock performance."", ""Yet, AbbVie is still raising its dividend payouts. And as a Dividend King, it is now in its 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases. Management isn't too worried about the company's Humira-related issues and thinks the business can continue supporting a solid dividend program. That's partly because of AbbVie's two other immunology therapies, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are doing a decent job of filling parts of the gaping hole left by Humira."", ""It's also because of a broad lineup that includes AbbVie's Botox franchise. That's to say nothing of AbbVie's deep pipeline that boasts several dozen programs, some of which feature brand-new products. AbbVie thinks it will return to top-line growth in 2025. In the meantime, income-seeking investors should hold onto their shares of the company."", ""AbbVie's excellent track record and robust underlying business will be fine even in this post-Humira world. Meanwhile, the drugmaker offers a dividend yield of 3.88% -- well above the S&P 500's average of 1.62%. AbbVie's payout ratio of 42% is also pretty conservative and leaves enough room for more dividend hikes."", ""It seems clear that Humira's patent cliff did not sink AbbVie's business or its dividend program. The drugmaker remains a top income stock for 2024 and beyond, in my view."", 'David Jagielski (Bristol Myers Squibb): Pharma giant Bristol Myers Squibb is coming off a bad year in 2023, with its share price falling 29%. But this is still a growth-oriented business that has the potential to be a great long-term investment. It also pays a dividend which today yields an impressive 4.6%.', ""Bristol Myers raised its dividend last month by more than 5%. It marked the 15th straight year that the healthcare company boosted its payouts. And for 92 straight years, the company has paid a dividend. That's an incredible track record given all that has happened during that stretch, including wars, recessions, and many other challenges the business has had to endure."", 'Investors today, however, are discounting the stock heavily. In addition to a high debt load, the company is facing multiple patent cliffs for top-selling drugs, including Eliquis and Opdivo, which are losing patent protection this decade. And that has investors worried about its future; at just seven times its estimated future profits, Bristol Myers stock comes incredibly cheap today.', ""While the headwinds the company is facing are worrisome, there are still growth opportunities ahead for Bristol Myers. The company has a strong pipeline, and it estimates that by 2029, its new products will bring in $25 billion in new revenue. That's a big chunk for a business that generates about $45 billion in sales annually."", ""Bristol Myers' strong track record for growth and acquisitions and overall versatility over the years make this an incredibly underrated and potentially undervalued dividend stock to buy right now. Although there is some risk with the stock, it shouldn't be enough to deter investors from investing in one of the top healthcare companies in the world."", ""Keith Speights (Pfizer): Some might say that Pfizer's dividend is about the only thing going for it these days. I'll readily admit that the big drugmaker's dividend yield of nearly 5.8% is appealing. As great as Pfizer's dividend is, though, I don't believe for a second that it's the company's only redeeming quality."", 'Sure, Pfizer delivered a dismal stock performance last year. Its share price is now more than 50% below the peak set in 2021. Sales are declining. So are profits. Does that make Pfizer a lost cause? Nope.', ""Pfizer stock is oversold, in my view. Shares currently trade at only 13.2 times expected earnings and 2.5 times trailing-12-month sales. The company's problems stem from plunging demand for its COVID-19 products Comirnaty and Paxlovid. But even if Pfizer didn't make a penny from COVID, it would still be attractively valued compared to other big pharma stocks."", ""I also think that many investors are overlooking Pfizer's non-COVID growth prospects. The company projects that it will add $45 billion in new revenue by 2030. New drugs and new indications for existing products make up $20 billion of that total, with the remainder expected to come from business-development deals."", ""Those aren't pie-in-the-sky projections. Pfizer has already launched several new products, notably including multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio and RSV vaccine Abrysvo, that should help. It's also already enjoying a boost from business-development deals such as the acquisitions of Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics, and Seagen."", ""I'll admit that the future of Pfizer's COVID franchise remains uncertain. However, the stock is about more than just COVID. As a result, Pfizer looks like a magnificent dividend stock to buy this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

It has new management at the helm to take over for the dominant digital wallet.

That represents a price improvement of more than 100% over the next year."", ""Here's why Faucette and his team see much more potential in PayPal than the market currently gives it credit for."", ""PayPal has a massive head start on other branded e-commerce checkout platforms. As such, it's accepted by 83% of the top 500 online merchants in the U.S., according to Morgan Stanley research. Importantly, that number continues to climb higher as management pushes its branded checkout button with merchants."", ""By comparison, PayPal's next closest competitor, Apple, boasts 48% acceptance. Note that Apple Pay is only available on Apple devices, so it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. (Sorry, had to do it.) Swedish buy now, pay later company Klarna is the next closest, with just 19% acceptance."", ""PayPal's big advantage in attracting merchants is that it brings a lot of users. It counts 393 million consumer accounts using its digital wallet. Not only does that reduce the amount of friction for those users to check out (no fussing with entering credit card details), it gives PayPal the data it needs to ensure low fraud rates. The ability to reduce fraud could save merchants using PayPal millions of dollars."", ""While PayPal has done an excellent job getting more merchants to use PayPal's branded checkout, it hasn't had the same success with Venmo. Morgan Stanley analysts point out this remains a big opportunity, especially as the user demographics grow into higher spending age groups."", 'Just 7% of the top U.S. merchants accept Pay with Venmo. When Faucette asked about it on PayPal\'s third-quarter earnings call, newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss said, ""We expect that both from a customer demand perspective as well as a merchant demand perspective, we will continue to drive acceptance ubiquity for Venmo.""', 'Behind the scenes, PayPal offers merchants the ability to process payments through its unbranded Braintree platform. PayPal is uniquely positioned to bundle its branded checkout (PayPal or Venmo) with its unbranded checkout (Braintree), offering merchants a discount for taking both. That makes it easier to establish merchant relations and cements its data advantage.', ""There's a reason PayPal shares have been beaten down over the last couple of years: It's facing a hangover from the pandemic-fueled growth of e-commerce. It's fighting against higher interest rates and inflation, weighing down on consumer spending. And it's seen margin contraction, as Braintree has been growing faster than its branded checkout services."", 'Chriss wasn\'t shy about pointing out the challenges the company faces. ""I believe our cost base and complex structure is slowing us down,"" he told analysts in November. ""We have opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses, helping further drive operating leverage.""', 'The company grew revenue 8% in the third quarter, and management forecast another 7% to 8% growth for the top line in the fourth quarter. That could accelerate in 2024. Transaction volume growth has outpaced revenue growth, and foreign-exchange headwinds could dissipate after a strong year for the dollar in 2023.', ""There's also room for margin expansion. Management expects to improve its operating margin 75 basis points for full year 2023. Finding more ways to cut costs, return to user and merchant growth, and leverage its network should lead to sustainable margin improvements over time."", ""In the meantime, PayPal remains a free cash flow-generating machine. It expects to generate $4.6 billion in free cash flow for 2023. And it's using that cash to repurchase shares."", ""PayPal bought back $4.4 billion worth of stock through the first nine months of 2023 and planned for an additional $600 million in share repurchases for the fourth quarter. Not only does the aggressive share repurchase plans support strong earnings-per-share growth, it indicates management's feelings that the stock is undervalued."", 'Faucette certainly agrees. With shares trading around 12x its trailing earnings, the stock looks like a bargain. Merely maintaining revenue growth at 8% and buying back shares should result in EPS growth that more than justifies that valuation.

As a result, major players in the space are forced to compete on price -- a dynamic that can impact a company's bottom line."", 'But amid the competitive landscape, one company in the industry looks potentially undervalued. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) may not be a company that is synonymous with monster growth, but its combination of strong cash flow and a high dividend yield could make it attractive for passive income investors.', ""Let's dig into Verizon's business and assess why 2024 could be a great time to open a position."", ""In addition to competition from the likes of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Comcast, Verizon also faces intense pressure from the rise in streaming services. This has caused customer churn to increase, which impacts the company's revenue and profitability. Unsurprisingly, Verizon's top line has decreased about 3% year over year through the first nine months of 2023, which ended Sept. 30."", ""But even as revenue decelerates, Verizon has found ways to sustain robust free cash flow. Through Sept. 30, Verizon's total free cash flow increased 18% year over year to $14.6 billion. The consistent generation of cash flow not only allows Verizon to pay off its debt but also to reward shareholders in the form of a dividend."", ""The chart above illustrates Verizon's dividend growth during its tenure as a public company. The basic takeaway is that throughout its corporate history, Verizon has demonstrated its commitment to loyal shareholders time and again. In fact, back in September, Verizon increased its dividend for the 17th consecutive year. That milestone alone makes me feel pretty confident that the company's dividend isn't going away."", ""The chart above shows that Verizon's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.3 is far below its 10-year average. Moreover, it also pales in comparison to competitors T-Mobile and Comcast, which trade at forward P/E ratios of 20.7 and 11.2, respectively."", ""The deterioration of Verizon's forward P/E ratio makes sense on some level, given the amount of competition among other telephone companies and streaming platforms. However, I think that these concerns are rooted more in perception as opposed to reality -- thereby cratering Verizon's stock to overly depressed levels."", ""I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a company that manages cash flow such that paying a dividend isn't in jeopardy even in the face of decelerating revenue. While the stock is likely not going to handily beat the S&P 500, dividend investors might be eager to scoop up shares at its current 7% yield.

The company was a notable laggard on the heavy-hitter lineup that is the large-cap S&P 500 index, plummeting by nearly 65% over the course of the year. Meanwhile, the index it's a part of zoomed more than 24% higher. The S&P 500 stocks did well, then, despite being burdened by Lumen."", ""Following that long-tail rout, Lumen has kicked off 2024 by trading well under $2 per share. Perhaps that makes it quite the bargain for discount-minded investors. Let's explore."", 'Lumen is a company in the middle of a long transition. Years ago, when it was known as CenturyLink, it devised a somewhat counterintuitive strategy to concentrate on legacy landline telecom operations. That was in sharp contrast to industry incumbents AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ), which pushed hard into mobile telephony.', 'We can see which approach is winning the day. Verizon is consistently profitable and has generally managed to grow its top line despite already-considerable size and scale (AT&T, which hived off its entertainment assets in 2022, is a more complicated story). Lumen, by contrast, has suffered several annual revenue declines in a row and has booked headline net losses in four of the trailing five years.', ""Under its newish CEO, former Microsoft U.S. president Kate Johnson, the company is attempting a turnaround. Sensibly enough, it's trying to pivot to more high-demand telecom segments while shaving costs."", ""However, there are challenges to this approach. Yes, the company can offer very speedy broadband internet access thanks to its extensive fiber network. However, other high-bandwidth options abound in the U.S. market. The company's ambition to be an important provider for businesses makes it one of numerous service providers jockeying for position."", ""What makes this situation particularly challenging is that the telecom industry is a serious capital consumer. It's ferociously expensive to build out and maintain capacity in this business. To be a competitor, Lumen took on a heavy debt load. Although that has lightened somewhat, it still stood at more than $19.7 billion as of the end of its most recently reported quarter."", ""To put those borrowings in perspective and compare them to peers, Lumen's debt-to-equity ratio -- an important balance sheet yardstick for stocks -- is just short of 9 at the moment. Those for both Verizon and AT&T, companies that have never been shy to go the debt route for financing, are well under 2."", 'Last October, Lumen got a bit of a break with creditors holding over $7 billion of its debt. These lenders agreed to extend the maturities of the securities at the heart of those borrowings out to 2029 and 2030. Additionally, those obviously flexible businesses agreed to provide $1.2 billion worth of new financing.', ""That's encouraging, but it only gives Lumen more time to retire the debt; that credit doesn't just melt away. Also, with interest rates currently being high relative to recent historical levels, interest payments on borrowings -- especially that new $1.2 billion -- aren't going to be cheap."", ""When a company is struggling with its finances, one lever it can pull is a dividend cut or suspension. Lumen elected to do this in late 2022, and there's no sign of the payout coming back. To put it mildly, investors weren't pleased, as the company had been considered something of an income stock."", 'Uncomfortably for Lumen, other telecom biggies are happy to pay a dividend and do so generously. At the moment, Verizon hands out a quarterly distribution of nearly $0.67, which yields quite a meaty 6.8% at the current share price. Not to be outdone, AT&T dispenses a bit under $0.28 every quarter for a competitive yield of 6.5%.', ""So those two incumbents are clearly in better fundamental shape than Lumen. The question is, can the latter's turnaround lift the company to success?"", ""I have some serious doubts. The telecom game is a tough one to play and an easy one in which to fall well behind. In the best case, Lumen's recovery (assuming it happens at all) will take years. I don't see a compelling reason to invest in a business that's such a long shot, particularly when there are solid income stocks in the same sector for the taking. I wouldn't place a bet on Lumen."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lumen Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lumen Technologies, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lumen Technologies wasn't one of them.

With many companies ramping up their purchases of its class-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's revenue shot through the roof. That boom is far from over, and the stock has already responded to the sales jump incredibly."", ""In 2023, the stock rose nearly 240%. That's a magnificent return, but what would have happened if you had held Nvidia for slightly longer than that -- say, starting in 2020? Well, the results and lessons learned might surprise you."", ""The first thing to understand about Nvidia's business is that it is cyclical. Its GPUs are used to run arduous workloads like gaming graphics, engineering simulations, drug discovery, cryptocurrency mining, and creating AI models. The business booms when consumers are flush with cash and companies are willing to invest in their computing capabilities."", ""Before the AI gold rush, the previous two Nvidia booms were spurred by cryptocurrency miners. Because GPUs are used to mine digital currencies, many people bought thousands of the company's chips to perform the task. This caused a sales spike in 2018 and 2021."", 'But the problem with booms is that they are usually followed by a bust, which is exactly what happened with Nvidia.', 'When the cryptocurrency market collapsed in 2019 and 2022, demand for GPUs evaporated, causing the company to post multiple consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Before the AI competition took off, Nvidia was still dealing with declining GPU sales, but the shot in the arm provided by AI quickly reversed its fortunes.', 'So, if you look at how much money you would have made by investing $10,000 in Nvidia at the start of 2020, you would have experienced quite the roller coaster ride.', 'In late 2021 (at the height of the market for many tech stocks and cryptocurrencies), Nvidia had turned a $10,000 investment into more than $50,000. But that figure was down to about $20,000 in just a few short months. In 2023, AI lifted the stock significantly, turning that original $10,000 into an incredible $82,000.', ""There are two important lessons about Nvidia's stock that this hypothetical exercise provides:"", ""It is a cyclical company. Most of its sales aren't subscription-based, so its incredible revenue right now might not seem so incredible by next year. As a result, investors need to consider how much demand the AI market can support. Once this limit is reached, expect sales to fall, which should cause the stock to collapse."", ""You must buy and hold companies for the long term. Many investors likely sold Nvidia stock in 2022 when it fell apart. While they were still up from their 2020 investment price, it wasn't nearly as much as if they had just held shares through the difficult times."", ""So what should investors do with Nvidia's stock now? In my opinion, if you don't own any Nvidia stock now, it might not be a great time to establish a position due to its high valuation."", ""However, this could be a terrible decision if the market for Nvidia's GPUs is much larger than I expect. So, taking a smaller position (no more than 1% of your portfolio) might not be a bad idea."", ""If you've held on to Nvidia's stock for this long, it's likely a substantial part of your portfolio due to its recent performance. Taking some gains here is wise, as the shares are highly valued and still cyclical (as many investors might be forgetting)."", ""Nvidia's stock has gone through a few boom-and-bust cycles; I don't know when the next bust is coming, but I think it's prudent to prepare should it come soon."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Supermicro sells highly configurable servers needed to run heavy workloads like AI applications.', ""Supermicro also has a close relationship with Nvidia, so it can squeeze the best performance out of each of Nvidia's GPUs found within these servers. With multiple companies purchasing new equipment to run these workloads, Supermicro benefits from the trend that has caused Nvidia's stock to skyrocket."", ""These tailwinds will benefit Supermicro in its fiscal year 2024, ending June 30, as management projects annual revenue to be about $10.5 billion, a 47% increase over fiscal year 2023. While that may not be as explosive as Nvidia's growth, Supermicro's stock is also priced cheaply, trading for just 16 times forward earnings."", 'Super Micro Computer represents an affordable alternative to Nvidia, making it a strong buy in January.', ""Microchips power the equipment used in these servers. There are only a few foundries worldwide, but the largest and most popular is Taiwan Semiconductor. Its popularity stems from its contract manufacturing status, which means it only makes chips for clients; it doesn't sell its own. As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor could be making chips side by side with a client's competitor."", 'Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor can make the smallest chips in the world, with its 3nm (nanometer) chips reaching full-scale production this year. Additionally, the next generation of chips (2nm) is slated to begin production in 2025.', 'That will keep Taiwan Semiconductor at the cutting edge of the semiconductor foundry companies, maintaining its competitive advantage.', 'While TSMC is amid a supply glut, management believes that this downturn is nearly over, making TSMC a great pick for a recovery in 2024.', 'Finally, Alphabet is one of the most popular AI investments in the market.

Gemini is the first model to outperform human experts in the massive multitask language understanding test, making it the most sophisticated model available. This will allow Alphabet to monetize this model, as anyone developing a generative AI platform will want to use the most accurate tools possible."", ""Alphabet also has a strong AI cloud computing offering in Google Cloud. Instead of purchasing a server from a company like Super Micro Computer, a company may decide to rent computing power from Alphabet. With more than 60% of the world's top 1000 largest companies and over 50% of AI start-ups using Google Cloud, it has a solid foothold in cloud computing."", ""This makes Alphabet a great AI investment for 2024, even if nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising.

There were some big winners to close out 2023, with Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) leading the pack up a huge 30% in December.', ""But the two biggest disappointments in December were Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Disney (NYSE: DIS), which both lagged the index's 4.5% gain and were both in the red for the month. Is that an investment opportunity?"", ""Procter & Gamble's shares fell roughly 4.5% in December. That's a big nine percentage points behind the Dow's gain. It caps a year in which the stock basically went sideways, down roughly 3% for the full 12-month span. Some might consider that dead money, but there are some things to like about the consumer staples giant."", ""For starters, P&G owns some of the most iconic consumer brands in the world. It holds leading positions in most of the niches in which it operates, often at the high end of the price range. It has the financial strength to invest heavily in research and development, marketing, and distribution, making it a very important partner for retailers. There's no reason to believe that it is about to give up its place as a key pace setter in the consumer staples space."", ""Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend annually for over 65 consecutive years, making it a highly elite Dividend King. The yield is roughly 2.5%, which isn't huge but is about middle of the road, historically speaking. Meanwhile, the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are a bit below their five-year averages, while price-to-book and price-to-cash flow are a bit above. It doesn't exactly look like P&G is cheap, but it also doesn't seem overpriced."", 'For investors who want an industry-leading company with a proven track record of paying reliable dividends, Procter & Gamble is probably worth a closer look. Just go in knowing that you are paying full fare.', ""Disney just reinstated its dividend, which it suspended in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. That cut made complete sense, given the importance of the company's parks, cruise ships, and movies (shown in movie theaters) to the top and bottom line. The world has learned to live with COVID, so now those businesses are normalizing and the dividend is back."", ""Only the investment story here isn't that simple. In fact, 2023 was a very volatile year for the stock, which was up more than 25% in the early months, but ended the year up just 4% following a brief dip into negative territory. The roughly 2.5% drop in December was simply Disney limping out of a hard year."", ""There has been a lot going on at the business. Some segments have, indeed, been fairly strong, notably the parks and cruises. But there have been a number of problem areas, like movies and traditional television. Even streaming services have been something of a mixed bag, with improving performance showing up as smaller losses. That means the business is still a net drag. And the company is dealing with a number of activist investors who aren't happy even after the company brought back former CEO Bob Iger."", ""From a valuation perspective, Disney's price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book value ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio are all well below their five-year averages. Price-to-earnings is higher, but the five-year average is biased high because of losses suffered during the pandemic. So Disney looks relatively cheap, but there are still material issues to consider business-wise. For example, traditional television is faltering, and streaming, which is expected to replace it over time, isn't yet profitable. The movie division has seemingly lost its way, an admission from Iger, and the planned slate of movie releases needs to be revamped."", ""It probably wouldn't be a massive mistake to buy Disney, but it looks like a turnaround story right now. More conservative investors will probably want to tread with caution and, perhaps, await further signs of progress before jumping aboard."", 'It is hard to suggest that either P&G or Disney are screaming buys. P&G is a well-run company trading at what seems to be a fair price, which might make it attractive for dividend investors worried about income consistency over valuation.', ""Disney is an iconic media company that's fallen on hard times. There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen right now, including the returning CEO and activist investors seeking changes of their own. The stock appears cheap, but there's a reason for that, and it might be advisable for risk-averse investors to watch from the sidelines for a little bit longer before investing."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

For a quick overview of 5 such stocks, read our article 5\xa0Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.', 'Markets are off to a slow start in 2024 as investors go into a wait and see mode regarding the Fed’s plan of action for possible rate cuts this year. While the NASDAQ slid in the first few days of the year and some circles are voicing skepticism over the Magnificent Seven’s ability to carry forward the gains seen in 2023, long-term analysts believe technology stocks have more room to run in 2024. Part of the reason why many notable analysts are bullish on the technology sector is the power of AI and generative AI software’s benefits for common people.', 'Josh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently talked on CNBC about the reason behind the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown said that there is a lot of profit-taking activity going on right now as investors saw remarkable returns from the technology sector in 2023, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. Brown said that as a wealth manager he can totally understand the logic of taking profits early in the year especially after such a spectacular rally. Brown, however, emphasized that the decline in tech stocks might look like these companies are “stumbling” but that is not the case.', 'Josh Brown also said that 2024 is the year when AI goes from “concept to product.” While he is not totally happy with their valuations,\xa0 Alphabet and Amazon are the top two tech stocks to own according to Brown because of their AI catalysts.', 'Wise investors know that a decline in stocks for a week or two or even a few months for that matter means nothing when seen in the long run. Tech companies working on products and services that impact millions of people around the world with strong balance sheets are expected to keep gaining momentum in the months and years to come. That’s why many analysts and money managers are piling into these stocks.', 'In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some of the top technology stock picks of billionaire Ken Griffin.', ""Ken Griffin of Citadel Investment Group Methodology For this article we scanned Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC's 13F portfolio for the third quarter of 2023 and picked the fund's top 12 technology stock picks. Some notable names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)."", 'Ken Griffin’s Stake: $319M', 'Ken Griffin’s Citadel decreased its stake in ride-sharing platform company Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\xa0by 11% in the third quarter. The fund still owns a $319 million stake in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).', 'Citi analyst Ronald Josey added Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\xa0to his top picks for 2024. Here is what the analyst said about these companies:', '“Underlying these themes are companies that, in our view, are stronger than they were a year ago. Most have gone through cost reductions and optimizations themselves resulting in sustainable margin expansion and stronger overall balance sheets.”', 'RiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Uber Technologies, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:UBER): UBER was the top contributor in the quarter following a better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report and 3Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $33.6 billion were up 16% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17 billion grew 25% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 12% from last year. 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $916 million, up $552 million year over year, significantly beat Street estimates of $845 million and the company generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Management guided to continuing growth in 3Q Gross Bookings (17%-20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $975-1,025 million).', 'UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments, the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”', 'Ken Griffin’s Stake: $319M', 'AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Inc. ranks 11th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Griffin’s fund increased its stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) by 182% in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a $319 million stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).', 'As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).', 'Miller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was\xa0AT&T Inc.\xa0(NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.', 'AT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”', 'Ken Griffin’s Stake: $324M', 'Even though Ken Griffin’s hedge fund cut its stake in social media platform company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\xa0by a whopping 53% in the third quarter, the fund still ended the period with a $324 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).', 'Overall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is enjoying a bullish view from analysts and hedge funds since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) successfully executed cost cutting and integrated AI in its products that led to huge usage growth.', 'Like Meta, hedge funds are also buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).', 'Blue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“On February 24, 2023,\xa0Meta Platforms, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:META) released Llama, their LLM project, with the code being open-source but the training weights being kept proprietary. Nonetheless, within a week the training weights were leaked for the project. This release of the weights for 65 billion parameter model was a huge gift for open-source programmers to begin experimenting upon. Within weeks, other developers were creating innovations building on the model. There has been a race towards developing low-budget fine-tuning projects that can be trained for specific applications at the cost of a few hundred dollars in some cases. Some of these LLM projects can even be run on individual computers rather than data centers.', 'After the voluntary release of Llama’s architecture as open-source, the leak of the model weights ended up being a blessing in disguise for Meta. The innovation and improvements that followed were all built on Meta’s AI codebase. They were able to get these innovations without needing to pay any of the open-source developers for their efforts. This also demonstrates that the business advantage of the large tech companies is not in their models or AI codebase. Any innovations that the companies develop are unlikely to stay within the walls of the companies due to the mobility of researchers being poached between companies by recruiters. However, as these new model improvement technologies are made, the big tech companies have a scale advantage. They will be able to employ it into models that have more data, more compute budget, more parameters and therefore more intelligence in the resulting neural net.”', 'Ken Griffin’s Stake: $355M', 'Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) ranks 9th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin.

Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings Inc.

No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.', 'As part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.', 'Booking Holdings, the world’s leading online travel agency, continues to benefit from a strong global travel environment with particular strength in Europe, Booking Holdings’ core market. Fears of peak ‘revenge travel’ following COVID-19 lockdowns have been misplaced in our view. We assess current travel volumes to be only slightly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 trends, with some regions, particularly outbound travel from China, still relatively depressed. Anyone who has travelled anywhere recently will be nodding when we say hotel rates have increased meaningfully in recent times. Accommodation providers are generally doing quite well, but the increased hotel rates have been necessary to offset inflation in costs such as employee salaries and additional cleaning services. As Booking Holdings ‘clips the ticket’ of accommodation spend, the company has benefitted from increased average daily hotel rates. Importantly, Booking Holdings continues to invest in its business, improving the reach, quality and range of services it provides, resulting in gains in market share and an extension of its industry leadership position. Booking Holdings is now more fairly valued by the market, but still provides attractive base case risk-adjusted returns and remains one of the larger investments in the Fund.”', 'Ken Griffin’s Stake: $552M', 'Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)\xa0is one of the best technology stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin.

This behemoth in the industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) space is experiencing solid demand for its portfolio of strategically located industrial facilities in some of the world’s busiest distribution markets.', 'The expansion of the e-commerce market has been a key demand driver for Prologis’ modern facilities in recent years. Services such as same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile assets in high-income urban areas are witnessing solid pricing, occupancy and rental growth.', 'In addition, companies are making concerted efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, propelling the demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks.', 'To find out whether Prologis, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will continue with its rally this year, let’s delve deeper into the fundamentals of the underlying asset category. We’ll also analyze the outlook of this asset category in the context of the macroeconomic factors that are likely to shape the industrial real estate market this year.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'As we step into 2024, the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the benchmark interest rate steady and the forecast of three rate cuts this year has cheered REIT investors. Given such favorable conditions, it is likely that commercial real estate investment activity will pick up pace this year.', 'As for the industrial real estate asset category, demand is expected to remain buoyant as growth in industries and expansion of the e-commerce market continue. Companies’ efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies will drive logistics infrastructure demand in the upcoming period. This bodes well for industrial real estate landlords like Prologis, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR and Stag Industrial STAG.', 'Per a CBRE Group, Inc. CBRE report, occupiers are focused on strengthening their supply chains by adding more import locations, onshoring or nearshoring more manufacturing operations and adequately staffing their distribution centers. E-commerce will continue to portray steady growth over the next decade, leading retailers and their suppliers to add more warehouse and distribution space.', 'Despite these promising signs, the asset category will likely face a few near-term headwinds. An expected stabilization of the U.S. industrial market in 2024 will lead to rent growth moderation. Per the CBRE report, rent growth is expected to moderate to 8%. Also, new deliveries in the early part of the year will cause the overall vacancy rate to rise and weaken pricing power.', ""Nonetheless, given Prologis’ portfolio of strategically located industrial facilities in some of the busiest distribution markets globally, it is well-poised to benefit from the favorable industrial real estate fundamentals. The company's properties are primarily located in large, supply-constrained infill markets in close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities, enabling quick product delivery to clients. Given occupiers’ efforts to expand in such locations, PLD, a prominent player in this space, is likely to continue experiencing robust demand for its properties."", 'The company is actively banking on its growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million. Such expansion moves have added greater scale to Prologis’ portfolio over the years and increased its capabilities.', 'In the past two years, Prologis closed two major acquisitions. In June 2023, it acquired nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced its presence in the key U.S. markets. In 2022, PLD closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion.', 'Prologis also has a high number of build-to-suit development projects, highlighting the advantageous location of its land bank, as well as the demand from its multi-site customers, many of whom are focused on e-commerce. The sites are positioned near large population centers suited for serving as the last mile warehouse before goods are delivered to consumers. For 2023, it is expected to carry out development starts ranging from $3 billion to $3.5 billion.', 'On the balance sheet front, this industrial REIT maintains a healthy balance sheet position, with no significant debt maturities until 2026. As of Sep 30, 2023, its liquidity amounted to $6.9 billion. It also enjoyed credit ratings of A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard & Poor’s, as of the same date, enabling it access to the debt market at favorable rates. Given its balance sheet strength, the company seems well-positioned to carry on with its growth endeavors.', 'Further, REITs are widely known for their regular dividend payouts as this offers stable income with a good inflation upside shield. With rate cuts expected on the line this year, dividend yields for REITs are likely to be attractive compared with the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts, making them a desirable investment choice.', 'Encouragingly, in the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.58%. Given the company’s solid operating platform, opportunities for growth, a decent financial position compared with the industry and our year-over-year growth projection of 27.2% for 2023 core FFO, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable over the long run. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.', 'Therefore, despite the elevated supply in this space gaining attention, this industrial real estate behemoth has the capability to tide over the near-term industry challenges with its solid portfolio, accretive buyouts and healthy financial position, placing it well for a promising performance this year.', 'Rexford Industrial Realty\xa0currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Pentair (NYSE:PNR) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Pentair is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.15 = US$803m ÷ (US$6.4b - US$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Pentair has an ROCE of 15%.

The company has employed 74% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 15%. Since 15% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", 'The main thing to remember is that Pentair has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 85% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.', ""One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Pentair and understanding this should be part of your investment process."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Occidental Petroleum's TSR for the last 3 years was 201%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Occidental Petroleum shareholders are down 6.2% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 22%.

On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.1% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

In other words, management aims to improve its profit margins while growing revenue at a mid-single-digit rate."", 'Following the spin-off from General Electric in early 2023, management has taken many routes to expand profitability. They include taking a more focused approach to pricing and ""product platforming"" (developing products that work off a common platform), investing in products powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and enhancing its software mix.', 'In addition, GE Healthcare has a significant opportunity in the growing field of theranostics\xa0(using agents to deliver drugs to precise areas), not least because it manufactures the agents used to diagnose, monitor, and guide drug delivery and the high-ticket imaging equipment.', ""However, I digress. The key to the move in December is probably the biggest driver of GE Healthcare's long-term margin expansion and growth plans, namely new product introductions (NPI). NPIs not only drive demand growth but also tend to come with higher margins.

The Fed’s December FOMC meeting minutes clearly indicate a sizable percentage of cut in the benchmark interest rate this year. A rate hike is a remote possibility as the majority of FOMC members want to see the full effect of existing interest rate range of 5.25-5.5%. The inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022.', 'A lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth speeding up investment by businesses. In 2022, small-cap companies suffered from record-high inflation, a soaring interest rate and fear of an impending recession. However, in 2023, this segment of the economy found some relief from these three concerns. The rate cut will further boost mid and small-sized enterprises.', 'A lower interest rate regime will be beneficial high-growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. Several companies in these spaces depend on cheap source of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in these stocks.', 'The global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system’s bypassing of China.

The long-term trend of Wall Street is very much bullish. However, markets are likely to fluctuate in the short-term due to profit booking on stretched valuation or unforeseen external disturbances like geopolitical conflicts or erratic behavior of energy prices.', 'In this regard, every dip will be a good buying opportunity even for those stocks that have skyrocketed in 2023 and have strong potential for 2024 and beyond.

There were some big winners to close out 2023, with Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) leading the pack up a huge 30% in December.', ""But the two biggest disappointments in December were Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Disney (NYSE: DIS), which both lagged the index's 4.5% gain and were both in the red for the month. Is that an investment opportunity?"", ""Procter & Gamble's shares fell roughly 4.5% in December. That's a big nine percentage points behind the Dow's gain. It caps a year in which the stock basically went sideways, down roughly 3% for the full 12-month span. Some might consider that dead money, but there are some things to like about the consumer staples giant."", ""For starters, P&G owns some of the most iconic consumer brands in the world. It holds leading positions in most of the niches in which it operates, often at the high end of the price range. It has the financial strength to invest heavily in research and development, marketing, and distribution, making it a very important partner for retailers. There's no reason to believe that it is about to give up its place as a key pace setter in the consumer staples space."", ""Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend annually for over 65 consecutive years, making it a highly elite Dividend King. The yield is roughly 2.5%, which isn't huge but is about middle of the road, historically speaking. Meanwhile, the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are a bit below their five-year averages, while price-to-book and price-to-cash flow are a bit above. It doesn't exactly look like P&G is cheap, but it also doesn't seem overpriced."", 'For investors who want an industry-leading company with a proven track record of paying reliable dividends, Procter & Gamble is probably worth a closer look. Just go in knowing that you are paying full fare.', ""Disney just reinstated its dividend, which it suspended in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. That cut made complete sense, given the importance of the company's parks, cruise ships, and movies (shown in movie theaters) to the top and bottom line. The world has learned to live with COVID, so now those businesses are normalizing and the dividend is back."", ""Only the investment story here isn't that simple. In fact, 2023 was a very volatile year for the stock, which was up more than 25% in the early months, but ended the year up just 4% following a brief dip into negative territory. The roughly 2.5% drop in December was simply Disney limping out of a hard year."", ""There has been a lot going on at the business. Some segments have, indeed, been fairly strong, notably the parks and cruises. But there have been a number of problem areas, like movies and traditional television. Even streaming services have been something of a mixed bag, with improving performance showing up as smaller losses. That means the business is still a net drag. And the company is dealing with a number of activist investors who aren't happy even after the company brought back former CEO Bob Iger."", ""From a valuation perspective, Disney's price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book value ratio, and price-to-cash flow ratio are all well below their five-year averages. Price-to-earnings is higher, but the five-year average is biased high because of losses suffered during the pandemic. So Disney looks relatively cheap, but there are still material issues to consider business-wise. For example, traditional television is faltering, and streaming, which is expected to replace it over time, isn't yet profitable. The movie division has seemingly lost its way, an admission from Iger, and the planned slate of movie releases needs to be revamped."", ""It probably wouldn't be a massive mistake to buy Disney, but it looks like a turnaround story right now. More conservative investors will probably want to tread with caution and, perhaps, await further signs of progress before jumping aboard."", 'It is hard to suggest that either P&G or Disney are screaming buys. P&G is a well-run company trading at what seems to be a fair price, which might make it attractive for dividend investors worried about income consistency over valuation.', ""Disney is an iconic media company that's fallen on hard times. There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen right now, including the returning CEO and activist investors seeking changes of their own. The stock appears cheap, but there's a reason for that, and it might be advisable for risk-averse investors to watch from the sidelines for a little bit longer before investing."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.
