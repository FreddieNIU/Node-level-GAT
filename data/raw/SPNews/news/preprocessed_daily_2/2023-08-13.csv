(NYSE:XYL) Stock's On A Decline: Are Poor Fundamentals The Cause?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xylem-inc-nyse-xyl-stocks-135520089.html,1691848520,STORY,['XYL'],"[With its stock down 8.3% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Xylem (NYSE:XYL). Given that stock prices are usually driven by a company’s fundamentals over the long term, which in this case look pretty weak, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators. Specifically, we decided to study Xylem's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Xylem How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xylem is:3.6% = US$352m ÷ US$9.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Xylem's Earnings Growth And 3.6% ROEIt is quite clear that Xylem's ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 5.5% seen by Xylem was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Xylem's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 8.2% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for XYL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Xylem Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Xylem has a high three-year median payout ratio of 61% (that is, it is retaining 39% of its profits). This suggests that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This goes some way in explaining why its earnings have been shrinking. With only very little left to reinvest into the business, growth in earnings is far from likely. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Xylem visit our risks dashboard for free.Moreover, Xylem has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 8.4%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Xylem. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ralph Derrickson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.Ralph Derrickson: Thank you. Good afternoon, investors, and welcome. Joining me today is Cheryl Wynne, BSQUARE’s Chief Financial Officer. Before we go any further, we’d like to remind you the call is being webcast and a recording of the call and the text of our prepared remarks will be available on the BSQUARE website. During today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. In our commentary, we may also refer to GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the cautionary text regarding forward-looking statements contained in BSQUARE’s earnings release issued today and on our website at www.bsquare.com under Investors.All per share amounts discussed today are fully diluted numbers where applicable. We will be taking questions after our prepared remarks. For anyone who would like to arrange a follow-up conversation with us, please send an e-mail to investorrelations@bsquare.com. This mailbox is monitored regularly and you will get a response within one business day. Let’s start by having Cheryl take us through the Q2 results in detail and I’ll continue with my remarks after that. Cheryl, why don’t you get us started?Cheryl Wynne: Thank you, Ralph, and good afternoon, investors. Today I’ll be providing an overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Let’s take a look now at the components of our results. I’ll start with a review of our income statement and then move to a discussion of our liquidity. Most of my comparisons will be to the first quarter of 2023. I’ll let you know when I’m comparing to other periods. Total revenue for the second quarter was approximately $6.5 million, which was a decrease of $1.6 million or 20% from the first quarter. The Partner Solutions segment was the primary driver of the decrease with a $1.5 million decline. Edge to Cloud revenue decreased $100,000. Despite the revenue decline, total gross profit increased by $90,000.Story continuesLet’s take a look at our revenue and gross profit results at a segment level, starting first with Partner Solutions. Partner Solutions revenue decreased $1.5 million or 21% quarter-over-quarter. The decline is the continuation of a general trend that we’ve seen in this segment for quite some time now. Partner Solutions gross profit increased to $164,000 and gross margin rate improved 6.8 percentage points. The gross profit decrease driven by the revenue decline was offset by margin rate improvement, primarily related to rebate credits earned through Microsoft’s distributor incentives program. These credits are recorded as a reduction of Partner Solutions cost of revenue, and have always had a favorable impact on Partner Solutions gross profit.However, the impact this quarter was greater as there were changes to the program. As a result of the changes, we recorded one-time adjustments of approximately $300,000 that favorably impacted Partner Solutions gross profit. In the Edge to Cloud segment revenue was $774,000, which was a decrease of a $100,000 compared to the first quarter. The decline was driven by reduced professional services provided to one of our customers who is transitioning to a new technology platform. The revenue decrease was the primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter gross profit decline of $77,000. Turning our attention now to expenses. Total operating expenses were $2 million, which was a $300,000 increase compared to the first quarter. The increase was entirely driven by selling, general and administrative or SG&amp;A costs as our research and development costs were flat quarter-over-quarter.Of the $300,000 increase in SG&amp;A about two thirds was due to a decrease in the recognition of cooperative rebate funds from Microsoft. We record these co-op funds as a reduction of marketing expense in the period the expenditure is approved. Timing related to the process of submitting claims and receiving expenditure approval can cause fluctuations in the amount of co-op funds recognized each quarter. Please note that going forward, due to the changes in Microsoft’s distributor incentive program, the full amount of rebate from Microsoft will be recognized as a reduction of Partner Solutions cost of revenue. None of it will be recognized as a reduction of marketing expense because there will no longer be requirements related to how the funds are spent.The remaining $100,000 increase in SG&amp;A was due primarily to an increase in professional fees related to our Annual Shareholder Meeting and strategic transaction activity. As you may recall, during the third quarter of 2022, we implemented an investment strategy intended to take advantage of favorable interest rates while maintaining a focus on liquidity. Our Q2 results include $390,000 of interest income. We intend to continue investing our cash reserves for the foreseeable future until there is an alternative use of the reserves that will produce a higher return for our shareholders. Our loss from operations for the quarter was $650,000, which was a deterioration of $300,000, compared to the first quarter driven by the SG&amp;A cost changes discussed earlier.Net loss for the quarter was $300,000 or $0.01 per diluted share compared to the first quarter net loss of a $100,000 less than a $0.01 per diluted share. On a year-to-date basis, loss from operations was $1.1 million and improvement of $500,000 compared to the same period in 2022. Year-to-date net loss was $300,000, an improvement of $1.2 million, compared to the first half net loss of $1.5 million in 2022. Turning now to our liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $33.4 million on June 30, 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to December 31, 2022. $660,000 of the decrease was driven by share repurchases and $1.5 million was due to changes in our working capital accounts. As a reminder, we announced a plan to repurchase up to $5 million worth of our common stock.Top 20 Electronic Gadgets for a Smart HomeZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.comDuring the first six months of 2023, we repurchased approximately 550,000 shares for just over $660,000. Since program inception, we have repurchased approximately 730,000 shares for just over $860,000. The repurchase program expired on June 30, 2023 and was not renewed, which Ralph will speak to in a moment. This concludes my summary of our second quarter results and I’ll turn it back to Ralph now.Ralph Derrickson: Thank you, Cheryl. The decrease in Partner Solutions revenue is disappointing, but consistent with the year-over-year decline in Microsoft OS licensing revenue that we have discussed on previous calls. Embedded product developers are increasingly turning to Linux and Android for their operating system in an effort to lower their product costs, especially for the smaller footprint devices. That said, we are winning new customers for Windows IoT with superior service and technical support, aggressive pricing, and giving them a path to device management and IoT operations. Unfortunately, revenue from new customers is not keeping pace with erosion from customers whose products are going end of life or are switching to alternatives for their OS software.We continue to work closely with Microsoft to share our experience and help them to strengthen the story for Windows IoT in the embedded market. But our expectation is that keeping licensing revenue erosion under 15% would be an achievement. Let’s turn our attention now to our bottom line and our efforts to run the business as efficiently as possible. As I’ve shared on the last three calls, achieving breakeven operations is a priority. Our progress towards that goal is most evident in the difference in year-to-date results. 2023 year-to-date operating results are $500,000 better than 2022, a 31% improvement. Further, our net loss improved by $1.2 million, a 78% improvement as our bottom line results were bolstered by interest income. The operating improvements came in part as a result of the staffing reductions we made in December of last year and efforts across the Board to reduce expense.These improvements are playing out in our operational cash consumption as well. Stepping back from operations, I’d like to turn our attention to what is happening on the strategic front. During the Q1 2023 earnings call, I said that we were not going to continue the status quo and that action would be taken in a timeline measured in months and quarters. As we shared in the earnings press release today, we have been working with Telegraph Hill Advisors, a San Francisco based investment bank to run a process to explore the full range of strategic options for generating shareholder value. There isn’t more information to share now, but rest assured we are moving thoughtfully and as aggressively as the process allows. While the process is running, we opted not to renew the share repurchase program.We don’t believe the current share price captures the full potential value of the company. Getting back to operations. We will continue to run the business as efficiently as possible and look for opportunities to demonstrate the potential for SquareOne to become the basis of a high margin SaaS business. We haven’t talked about SquareOne since we announced late last year that we were dialing back marketing, but that doesn’t mean we’ve stopped all efforts. In fact, we are an active evaluation with a number of companies who are considering SquareOne as the basis for their device management needs and other customers considering SquareOne as the basis for their IoT system. We have made significant architectural improvements to Square One that will allow developers to extend the core functionality via plugins and web socket.Notably, this allows us to use AI and ML at the edge and in the cloud to build sophisticated systems that allow individual devices to contribute data and participate in shared decision making. All of these capabilities can be seen on the SquareOne evaluation site on our website that gives customers up to 30 days of access to SquareOne at no charge. Concluding then we will continue to serve our customers with superior products and services. At the same time, we will strive to maximize the operational assets of the business while aggressively pursuing strategic options. The Board, Cheryl and I are balancing those priorities with the objective of developing options and opportunities to return value to our shareholders.

She has confronted many of the industry's biggest names, with major lawsuits against Facebook parent Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT).Not all of them have produced victories, resulting in some political blowback in Washington and skepticism that her strategy is to lose so Congress will change antitrust laws.Khan, now 34, rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.""The article argued modern antitrust laws weren't equipped to tackle the tech industry's anticompetitive behavior because they were too focused on pricing as a means of determining consumer harms.FTC Chair Lina Khan, preparing to testify before a House committee last month. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Those laws, she argued, needed to be rethought to bring Big Tech companies to heel. Now she is attempting to rein in these companies as chair.""Love or hate her, [Khan] has a very clear vision of what the role of the FTC is and what the role of the chair is,"" former Federal Communications Commission Chair Harold Furchtgott-Roth told Yahoo Finance. ""And that vision is a very aggressive and ambitious one and she’s taking every step possible to make that vision become a reality.""The FTC declined to comment.The US scrutiny of Big TechKhan isn’t the only government official going after the nation's biggest tech companies.The Department of Justice and a collection of state attorneys general are suing Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google in two consolidated cases launched during President Trump’s administration, alleging the company abuses its market power across search and search advertising to squeeze competition.Story continuesThose cases go to trial next month before the US District Court of the District of Columbia, which has dismissed some of the claims.Google said ""we look forward to showing at trial that promoting and distributing our services is both legal and pro-competitive.""Khan is juggling cases against several other giants. In one case against Facebook-owning Meta, the FTC under Khan tried to block Meta's acquisition of virtual reality fitness company Within.Her agency is also trying to force the social media juggernaut to split apart Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, in a separate case filed before Khan took over as chair.Another target: Microsoft. Khan has fought to prevent the Windows maker from completing its acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI).But Khan’s biggest test will be her challenge against Amazon. The suit, according to Politico, will likely focus on Amazon’s e-commerce business and whether it puts unfair pressure on sellers who use its marketplace.These arguments echo complaints made by the state of California and Washington DC, which argued that Amazon’s pressure on these sellers forced them to hike prices outside of the Amazon platform.Amazon has denied those claims, saying sellers set their own prices and that Amazon makes no effort to prevent them from offering lower prices elsewhere. The case filed by Washington DC was thrown out by a judge last year, and the California case is ongoing.An Amazon worker moves boxes last month in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)If FTC does decide to sue Amazon, it would be Khan's second case against the company. A separate lawsuit the commission filed in July accuses Amazon of tricking consumers into signing up for its Prime service and purposely making it difficult to cancel those subscriptions.Amazon declined to comment.Pushback in WashingtonKhan’s efforts, however, haven’t always been successful. In July, a federal judge blocked the commission’s request for an injunction seeking to keep Microsoft from completing the deal. The FTC has since pulled out of its in-house suit, and will likely negotiate with Microsoft over potential concessions for the deal.The commission also failed in its battle to prevent Meta from being able to purchase VR company Within.During a July hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, some Republicans pounced on Khan’s failures, calling her a ""bully"" and arguing that her leadership of the agency had been a ""disaster.""But at least one expert says that the FTC is moving in the right direction despite recent misses.""I think the FTC is doing the right thing in trying to rein in mergers and challenging self-preferencing rules,"" Stanford Law School Professor Mark A. Lemley told Yahoo Finance.""I think they have run up against 40 years of entrenched (and outdated) attitudes that disfavor antitrust law, which has led to them losing cases in the courts that they clearly should have won,"" Lemley added. ""It's not obvious to me how we can change that judicial resistance without legislation.""Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)Khan’s prior losses against tech firms also have little to do with the FTC’s chances in any potential case against Amazon, explained NYU School of Law professor Eleanor Fox.""I know the press makes a huge deal of losing the first case and losing the second case, but the fact is…it was just lost because of proof of fact,"" Fox said. ""And it really doesn't say a lot about what will happen next time in a big case.""Khan’s potential tussle with Amazon would be among the most important battles between the Biden Administration and Big Tech. Whether it actually plays out at all could depend on Khan’s showdown with the company next week.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our analysis of the edible oil industry and innovations that come from changing health preferences, read 8 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World. Palm oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed (canola) oil are among the most consumed edible oils in the world. The global edible oil industry has experienced significant growth since the demand for dietary fats and oils has seen a parallel increase. The global edible oil industry was valued at $212.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% between 2022 and 2027 to reach $$268.9 billion by 2027. Of this, the two top global edible oils by consumption, namely palm oil and soybean oil, are the biggest stakeholders. According to Precedence Research, the market value of palm oil was $65.08 billion in 2022, and at a CAGR of 5.2%, it will reach $107.53 billion by 2032. Likewise, the market value of soybean oil was recorded to be $48.16 billion in 2021 and will reach $60.08 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 3.21%, according to Fortune Business Insights.We have already covered some crops that produce the most popular edible oils, like soybean and corn oil, and are absolutely necessary for the world's survival. Learn more in 20 Most Grown Crops In The World.Companies Banking On The Edible Oil Industry Besides their obvious use in food, some of the most consumed edible oils have now found their way into the fuel industry. Green diesel, also called renewable diesel or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), is a biofuel produced from renewable sources. It is produced through a refining method named 'hydrotreating, unlike traditional biodiesel (which is made through transesterification). The feedstocks for green diesel include vegetable oils (like soybean or palm oil), animal fats, and waste residues. Chemically, green diesel is very similar to petroleum-based diesel, so it can be used directly in diesel engines without any modifications.Story continuesGiven the rising demand for green diesel, many companies have started diversifying their edible oil supply chains to allocate some of their stock to biofuels. For instance, to compete in the green diesel market, Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) have announced to build a $350 million soybean crush in Spiritwood, North Dakota. The plant, called Green Bison Soybean Processing Plant, will produce soybean oil to be used as renewable diesel feedstock, among other regular uses. The joint venture is expected to produce 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil that will be then supplied to Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) as a feedstock for renewable diesel. Since Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) has an extensive logistics network and the plant will be in a major soybean-producing region, its production and processing capacity will be unmatched. President of Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) 's Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds business, Greg Morris, said:""This exciting new project allows us to partner with North Dakota farmers to further advance the role of agriculture in addressing climate change through the production of low carbon feedstocks for products such as renewable diesel.""Further, the ADM's president of North America Oils, Biodiesel, and Renewable Chemicals, Ken Campbell, added: ""The need for lower-carbon, more sustainable products is one of the fundamental trends underlying ADM's strategy and purpose, and we're proud to continue to scale up our leadership in this critical area.""As the state-of-the-art project of Marathon Petroleum Corp, (NYSE:MPC) and ADM will have a processing capacity of 150,000 soybean bushels per day, it's surely going to be fundamental in the region's self-sufficiency in oil production.Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is another global leader in sourcing and supplying oilseed and grain products. The company operates in the edible oil supply chain by procuring, processing, and distributing oil products. Very recently, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) acquired a state-of-the-art oil refinery from Fuji Oil in Louisiana to expand its foothold in the edible oil market. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) aims to serve its customers through the newly acquired oil facility in the second quarter of 2023. Bunge's President of Food Solutions, Aaron Buettner, said: ""This acquisition delivers on our long-term strategy to expand our value-added oils business by accelerating reach across North America.""We have already covered the 12 Biggest Palm Oil Companies in the World; read this intelligent study to learn about the market's main entities.Let's now proceed with the top edible oils by consumption. 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The WorldOur Methodology We found the world's favorite edible oils from the Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations (UN FAO) database. Notably, we used the latest annual production on file of these oils as a proxy of their consumption since there's limited credible data on their per-year use. Also, for two of the most popular cooking oils globally, we derived the consumption figures from their seed production, which we will explain later. Based on our findings, here are the leading edible oils in worldwide consumption: 15. Safflower Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 69517 metric tons Safflower oil is produced from the seeds of the safflower plant (Carthamus tinctorius). Major safflower oil producers include India, the United States, and Mexico. In India, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are the leading safflower-cultivating states because of their appropriate weather. Notably, the oil has witnessed an upsurge in demand due to its health benefits as it is rich in unsaturated fats and low in saturated fats, which resulted in its inclusion in foods and supplements.14. Mustard Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.212 million metric tonsMustard oil is extracted from the seeds of the mustard plant and is a staple in many South Asian cuisines, especially in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. India is the world's largest producer and consumer of mustard oil. The country's Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana states are the primary mustard-cultivating regions. Besides culinary usage, mustard oil is also employed in medicines and has applications in therapeutic massage. Like castor oil, we found the estimated annual consumption of mustard oil based on the fact that the average yield of mustard seeds is 38.5%. With this formula, here's what annual mustard consumption would look like:Mustard seed production in 2021: 0.551 million tonsAverage oil production from mustard seeds: 38.5%0.551 million tons (seed production) x 0.385 (oil content) = 0.212 million tons or 212,135 tons.13. Castor Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.892 million metric tonsCastor oil comes from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant, which is native to tropical areas in Eastern Africa. Owing to agricultural advancements, the plant is now cultivated in other regions as well. For instance, India is a leading producer of castor oil, followed by Brazil and China. Economically, castor oil is also an essential industrial raw material in the manufacture of cosmetics, soaps, lubricants, and some pharmaceuticals. Since there were no official figures on the annual production/consumption of castor oil, we took castor oil seeds' annual production from the UN FAO database. Then, on average, castor oil seeds produce 40-50% oil, so using the mid-point of 47.5% can provide a safe number.So we calculated the annual consumption using this formula:Castor oil seeds = 1.88 million Average oil production from seeds = 47.5%1.88 million tons (seed production) x 0.475 (oil content) = 0.892 million tons or 892,000 tonsThe final consumption figure for castor oil stood at 0.892 million metric tons annually. 12. Flaxseed Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.955 million metric tons Linum usitatissimum is the only source of flaxseed oil, which is celebrated for its rich alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content, a form of omega-3 fatty acid. Canada and China dominate flax production, but Russia and Kazakhstan also contribute to global supply. Flaxseed oil's health benefits in cardiovascular wellness and inflammation reduction have recently boosted its demand in health-conscious people.11. Sesame Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 1.34 million metric tons Sesame oil is pressed from sesame seeds and boasts a distinctive nutty aroma. Its flavor profile makes it a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Myanmar, India, and China are top producers of sesame oil and drive its market value up to $4.12 billion. Like other most consumed edible oils, this one also has uses in traditional medicines like Ayurveda. The oil's antioxidant properties have made it a key export commodity in the aforementioned countries.10. Coconut Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 2.61 million metric tons Coconut oil is produced from the kernel of mature coconuts in the Philippines, Indonesia, and India. The major exporters of coconut oil are, again, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. India isn't a major exporter of coconut oil because of its vast domestic consumption.  Notably, coconut has a moderate smoke point, so it is not used for high-heat cooking, like the deep fryers used in commercial kitchens. The oil's moisturizing attributes have made it a staple in skincare and haircare formulations.9. Olive Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 3.37 million metric tonsOlive oil is a cornerstone of Mediterranean diets, where it is pressed from green olives. Unsurprisingly, Spain, Italy, and Greece are the top consumers and prime producers of this cherished oil. The economic influence of olive oil in these regions is also profound, as it shapes agricultural practices and export strategies. Click to continue reading 8 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World.Suggested Articles15 Most Consumed Crops in the World15 Most Consumed Meats in the World15 Most Consumed Cheeses in AmericaDisclosure: None. 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

For more destinations, head on over to Top 5 Medical Tourism Destinations in the World.Every year millions of people travel from one country to another in search of specialized medical care. Likewise, people book trips to countries for various medical procedures, from cosmetic surgery to dental work to orthopedic procedures. The rise of healthcare costs and health tourism destinations that offer quality healthcare perks has given rise to a medical tourism market growing at a compound annual growth rate of 21.1%.While the market was valued at $11.56 billion in 2022, it stagnated significantly following the COVID-19 pandemic that closed borders. The sector experienced a 46.9% decline as people's movement was restricted significantly. The easing of travel restrictions is the catalyst that fueled a bounce back, starting in late 2021, with the market growing from $13.98 billion and expected to be worth $53.51 billion by 2028.According to the Medical Tourism Association, over 14 million people travel to other countries annually for medical care. Technological advancements in the healthcare sector in some countries, characterized by the launch of new medical devices, limited treatment, and non-invasive surgeries, fuel tourism for medical procedures. Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE:CAH) is one of the companies that benefit from a booming medical tourism sector as it offers healthcare services and products around the globe. As people seek treatments in the US, Canada, or Europe, they are likely to leverage one of Cardinal Health's customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, and clinical laboratories. The company provides products and solutions to almost all US hospitals, over 60,000 US pharmacies, and more than 10,000 clinics for specialty doctors. It also offers more than 46,000 products for home healthcare to more than 3.4 million patients. The company has a digital platform to help patients follow their medication plans, reaching over 23 million patients and over 60 payers.Story continuesHCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is another top healthcare stock that benefits from a booming medical tourism sector. HCA had 182 hospitals and about 2,300 sites for outpatient care, such as surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and clinics for doctors, in 20 US states and the UK, as of June 30, 2023. The stock is already up by more than 20% for the year on investing billions of dollars to advance its facilities, systems, and equipment to offer high-quality healthcare services capable of attracting medical tourists. The company has also adopted patient-centered practices, such as providing multilingual staff, cultural sensitivity training, and concierge services, to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of medical tourists.Medical tourism becoming a multibillion empire has seen many countries invest billions of dollars to advance their healthcare systems in the race to attract medical tourists. Healthcare organizations and governments in some of the top medical tourism countries are investing billions of dollars to secure the right tools, resources, and talent to rank higher and attract millions of patients annually.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), which manufactures and markets products that enhance the quality of minimally invasive care, is at the heart of the global medical tourism destination. The top medical tourism destination increasingly relies on the company's da Vinci Surgical System to enable complex surgeries using a minimally invasive approach. As more people flock to these countries, the company benefits from increased sales of its solutions. In addition, disruption in the aviation industry continues to enhance the growth of the medical tourism industry. Low-cost airlines make it easy for people to move between countries in search of various treatment options. With some medical procedures costing six figures in developed countries like the US and the UK, many people are being forced to look elsewhere where the procedures cost as little as four figures. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is one of the airlines that benefits from Americans traveling to Latin American nations, including Mexico and Argentina, in pursuit of cost-effective medical procedures.  People are increasingly leaving the US to Malaysia, Thailand, Costa Rica other countries in pursuit of dental procedures, plastic surgery, and cancer treatments that cost up to 60% less. In 2020, 290,000 Americans went abroad for dental procedures. Healthcare costs are 80% lower in Malaysia and 70% lower in Mexico compared to the US.According to the Medical and Health Tourism Congress, medical treatment is cheaper in most Asian countries than in private hospitals in the US. For instance, a heart bypass surgery in Thailand costs nearly nine times less at $13000 to $113,000 in the US. Hip replacement in Thailand costs about $7800 compared to $50,000 in the US.  The lower costs of medical care contribute to an increasing number of medical tourists in Asia compared to North America. Medical tourists flock to most countries expecting to save 25% to 75% on various procedures and treatment options. Depending on the country, savings can reach 90% compared to the home country. For instance, medical services in Panama cost between 40% and 70% less than in the US and Canada.Top 20 Medical Tourism Destinations in the WorldAgencies and countries are increasingly setting up less expensive healthcare programs in the race to attract a high volume of foreign visitors from developed countries. The flow of patients from developed countries to other countries in search of affordable treatments is making medical tourism a considerable norm.Amid the robust growth, choosing a healthcare destination is proving to be a big challenge for consumers around the globe. The situation is becoming trickier as the media continues to sell multiple risks of moving from one country to another in pursuit of various medical treatments.Nevertheless, the Medical Tourism Index has sought to make it easy for patients worldwide to make informed decisions on the countries to visit for the best healthcare services. The index evaluates the country's healthcare system and procedures based on various indicators.Our MethodologyOur list of the world's top 20 medical tourism destinations is based on the Medical Tourism Index. We analyzed the countries based on three key main metrics. First, we considered the Destination Environment, focusing on the country's socioeconomic and cultural factors that determine whether it's easy to move in and out of treatment.Secondly, we considered the medical tourism infrastructure in the countries, focusing on the level of communication in the countries, the competent programs on offer, and finally, the medical travel facilitation. The quality of the facilities and services offered was the final metric analyzed to rank the countries as top medical tourism destinations.We ranked the countries based on the medical tourism index score. The highest-ranking countries are best known for their advanced medical systems and ability to offer some of the most complicated procedures at highly affordable rates. Another factor considered is the availability of treatment options without any long wait times.Top Medical Tourism Destinations in the World20. ArgentinaMedical Tourism Index Score: 66.26Destination Environment: 16/46Medical Tourism Industry: 18/46Quality of Facilities and Services: 25/46Argentina has one of the best healthcare systems in Latin America that includes a variety of doctors, dentists, and specialists that can carry out even the most complex procedures.

19,c1fe947f-391c-3541-8a0e-0f565db4ed7b,MAT,2023-08-13,He's 'just Ken' but will the 'Barbie' movie change his popularity?,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hes-just-ken-barbie-movie-130653159.html,1691845613.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — On and off the big screen, it's Barbie's world and Ken is just living in it.As reflected in Greta Gerwig's blockbuster movie that tackles the legacy Mattel's famous doll, Barbie has always been more popular than Ken. For every Ken doll sold today, there’s generally eight to 10 Barbies sold, according to Jim Silver, a toy industry expert and CEO of review site of TTPM.It's unclear if Warner Bros' “Barbie,” which was also co-produced by Mattel, will increase Ken production and sales. But Silver noted that the movie “gave Ken more attention than Ken has received"" in decades.Ken was first introduced back in 1961, two years after Barbie hit store shelves. But he hasn't had nearly the same impact on the Barbieverse since.“Barbie’s world is about Barbie. And (to some), Ken may be an accessory of sorts,"" said Ed Timke, an assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University, pointing to years of marketing that has, naturally, put Barbie at center stage.The new attention around Ken following “Barbie’s” release has also received pushback. Many note that the movie is about Barbie — not Ken — and that's where the spotlight should stay.Still, the dynamic between the film’s Barbie and Ken may get people to reflect some big questions about gender as well as Ken's own evolution over the years.Who is Ken as a toy and how has he changed?Ken's relationship to Barbie has been up for debate since the two hit the toy aisle together. While Mattel long-advertised Ken as Barbie's boyfriend — and even detailed their 2004 split and subsequent reconciliation seven years later — many also saw Ken as Barbie's best friend, and sometimes queer icon. One 1993 version of Ken in particular, Earring Magic Ken, became notably popular among LGBTQ consumers, the New York Historical Society notes. At the time, Mattel denied the Earring Magic Ken was queer and later pulled him from shelves.Story continuesOther popular versions of Ken ranged from the tuxedo-wearing 1984 Dream Date Ken, to 1978 Superstar Ken and 1979 Sun Malibu Ken, which became one of the doll's most iconic looks (as reflected in Ryan Gosling's character). While Ken has gone through far fewer career changes than Barbie, his resume boasts job titles like astronaut, barista, country western singer and doctor.“A wonderful thing is that through play, children are free to have their dolls take on any type of role that they wish,” said Ann Herzog, a clinical instructor of child life and family-centered care at Boston University.She also underlined the importance of diversity in toy collections and providing “open-ended play opportunities and not to endorse stereotypes that the Barbie collection and dolls in general are only specific to a particular gender.”While children of all genders, including young boys, have played with Barbie and Ken over the years, Timke notes that “there’s definitely the gendering of marketing toward girls” for both figures, pointing to contrasts in advertising for products historically seen as “boy toys,” such as G.I. Joe. That legacy, as well as other socialization, still impacts who plays with certain toys today.Still, Ken — like Barbie — has evolved over time and become more diverse, particularly after Mattel rolled out more skin tones, body types, hairstyles and more for Ken dolls in 2017. Some Kens also have prosthetic legs, wheelchairs and hearing aids. Increases in diverse representation — with similar changes seen since 2016 for Barbie — has boosted the dolls' popularity and comeback sales, Silver said.Will Barbie (and Ken) sales increase following the movie’s release?Mattel did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for data or comment on specific Ken and Barbie sales seen before and after “Barbie's” July 21 release. But according to market research firm Circana, Barbie sales overall for the U.S. toy industry increased 40% in the last two weeks of July compared with the same period in 2022.Circana doesn't break out Ken from Barbie sales. Still, “I suspect that, with the movie, sales of Ken dolls will experience a strong lift in sales,"" Juli Lennett, VP, U.S. toys industry advisor at Circana, wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Additional experts also expected a spike in interest, but weren't sure about the long run.Lennett did note that the top-selling “Barbie” movie item for those last two weeks of July was the Barbie Gingham Dress followed by the Ken Doll Set. Between those two items, Barbie outsold Ken nearly two to one, she said.For the second quarter of 2023, which ended weeks before the movie’s release, worldwide sales of Barbie to retailers excluding adjustments actually fell 6%. Mattel executives told analysts that sales had improved in July, and it expects the movie will have a halo effect on the brand for years to come.There was a carryover of inventory across the toy industry for the first half of the year, Silver explains, noting that record sales in the first years of the pandemic led to over-buying at the end of 2022. He predicts a rebound in Barbie sales heading into the holiday season, when toy spending is high and after “Barbie” eventually makes its way to streaming.And of course, sales following “Barbie’s” release won’t be limited to the toy aisle. Other branded products are also gaining popularity from the film, including Ken-focused swag like “I am Kenough” sweatshirts and other “Ken-ergy” apparel, are currently for sale by Mattel, as well as from third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and Walmart.]"

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Amgen's shares on or after the 17th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 8th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.13 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$8.52 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Amgen has a trailing yield of approximately 3.2% on its current stock price of $262.51. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Amgen has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Amgen Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Amgen paid out 55% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 45% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Amgen's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 41% per annum for the past five years. The current payout ratio suggests a good balance between rewarding shareholders with dividends, and reinvesting in growth. With a reasonable payout ratio, profits being reinvested, and some earnings growth, Amgen could have strong prospects for future increases to the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Amgen has delivered 19% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Amgen an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Amgen's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Amgen looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.In light of that, while Amgen has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Amgen you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:NRG) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a US$8.4b market cap stock, it seems odd NRG Energy is not more well-covered by analysts. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing given that there are less eyes on the stock to push it closer to fair value. Is there still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NRG Energy’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for NRG Energy What Is NRG Energy Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy NRG Energy today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $41.84, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that NRG Energy’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will NRG Energy generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extreme expected decline in the top-line over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. Even with a larger decline in expenses, it seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for NRG Energy.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? NRG seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NRG for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on NRG should the price fluctuate below its true value.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

24,33f3c94f-5ae0-3aec-b8e2-dde4668ae741,NEE,2023-08-13,3 Cheap Battery Stocks That Smart Investors Will Snap Up Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cheap-battery-stocks-smart-182613460.html,1691346373,STORY,"['ENR', 'NEE', 'ENPH']","[The 21st century is truly the time for battery stocks to shine!The cheap battery stocks of today could provide the generational wealth of tomorrow. The world continues to increasingly rely upon them to meet climate needs. Everything is being electrified in the push to move away from hydrocarbons. As a result, we have a higher demand for batteries to store energy as well.Battery stocks are growing in value every year as they continue to replace oil and coal. Some investors may look suspiciously at a stock that has risen over 1000% in a short time. Doesn’t that mean it’s clearly overbought?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet a rapidly growing company may indeed be undervalued if the market doesn’t appreciate its rapid and continued growth. And when improved technology and political will work together, decarbonization will continue to bring explosive growth. Some of the best cheap battery stocks are those that have already seen a massive run-up. But they’re still cheap because they have much further to run.So with an eye toward the future, let’s examine these three battery stocks smart investors should buy now.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWhile Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is best known for its solar power micro-inverters, its batteries may help it achieve even higher highs.With a wide variety of batteries for home storage, Enphase pairs solar power with battery backup quite efficiently. That makes them the clear choice for people reducing their carbon footprint. America and many of the world’s nations are struggling to achieve their climate goals. Subsidies and tax breaks have made solar power with batteries the perfect renewable energy for homeowners.Although Enphase has already achieved explosive growth, its financial position makes it still a cheap battery stock. In Q2 2023 Enphase had revenue of $711 million, over a third more than its revenue of $530 million prior year. Likewise in Q2 2023, Enphase had net income of $157 million, over twice as much as its Q2 2022 net income of $78 million.Story continuesThe bottom line? Enphase is growing by leaps and bounds every quarter. The world’s increasing focus on renewable energy to fight climate change means Enphase will have a growing business for years to come. And that makes them one of the best cheap battery stocks for smart investors.Energizer (ENR)a line of AA batteries to represent battery stocks. best battery stocks to buySource: ShutterstockEnergizer (NYSE:ENR) is battery company famous for its “Energizer Bunny” advertising campaign. As a battery brand that has a strong mindshare in the public consciousness, they have the potential to grow earnings by smart cost cutting. Most known for personal batteries, ENR is a leader in car batteries and home-solar batteries.In the news recently, Energizer caught political flack for its plan to close a Wisconsin factory and move production overseas. But such a move may be necessary to drive down production costs. Operating on thin margins and high volume, such cost savings will be needed to maintain future profits.In terms of financial outlook, Energizer has been mostly stable. Their Q1 2023 earnings report showed net sales unchanged from a year earlier at $684 million. However, thanks to cost cutting, Q1 2023 net earnings grew to $40 million, up from prior year earnings of $19 million.Energizer also offers a dividend, which at current prices sits at 3.24%, over twice the average of the S&amp;P. So while revenue may not be growing, Energizer is exceptionally valuable for a dividend investor. The bottom line is that cost cutting, stability, and a good dividend make Energizer a wise second battery pick to buy.NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comLet’s keep in mind that large battery infrastructure is also a need. Economies of scale mean large power providers are the best positioned to transition the world’s energy economy to renewables and batteries.That’s where NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) comes in, having more energy storage than any other company in the U.S. At 2.67% according to current prices, the combination of good growth and a strong dividend makes NextEra a cheap battery stock for any investor. As continued growth is likely, NEE is planning to bring between 32,700 MW to 41,800 MW of renewable and storage capacity online between 2023 and 2026.Financially, NextEra’s growth seems assured, as does the safety of its dividend. NextEra’s Q2 2023 earnings report showed operating revenue of $7.3 billion. That figure is over 40% greater than its Q2 2022 operating revenue of $5.2 billion. NextEra also reported Q2 2023 net income of $2.6 billion, over twice as much as prior year net income of $1.1 billion. Growing by leaps and bounds, this large-scale renewables plus storage battery makes it the third choice in my picks.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our stock market analysis and a discussion of what makes a stock cheap, then head on over to 5 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. Investing comes in all sorts of flavors and options to suit whatever risk appetite an investor might have. For those that want to grow their money, the market is full of high growth stocks whose prices trade at significantly higher levels than their earnings per share. For those that are unwilling to take risks, value stocks offer a semblance of stability as their share price is mostly in line with earnings which makes the risk of a downturn significantly lower than the high growth companies.One popular way of determining whether a stock is expensive or cheap is the price to earnings ratio. A cheap stock, as intuitive as it might sound otherwise, is not one whose share price is low. Instead, in the financial world, the 'cheapness' of the stock is measured through the ratio of its share price with its earnings. Now, since there are different earnings estimates of a firm, there are different P/E ratios as well. The true value of a company, or the real value, is the one at which its shares trade on the stock market. And its real EPS is the latest reported value in an annual release. The P/E ratio which uses the real values is called the price to current earnings ratio, or the current P/E ratio in short. A P/E ratio that takes into account the firm's latest performance is the trailing P/E ratio that uses the EPS value in the four latest quarters.However, being the busy bees that they are, analysts are busy working their magic with a firm's balance sheet and income statements. These financial reports can be used to project a company's future financial performance, and a derived EPS value from these is an estimate of how well a company can perform in the future. This EPS can also be used with the existing share price, for a ratio officially dubbed as the price to forward earnings or the forward P/E ratio.Story continuesYet, calculating a P/E ratio does not tell anything on its own about whether a firm is expensive or cheap. Instead, this metric is compared with peer values to determine where the firm stands. This bit is necessary since firms belonging in different industries often have wildly different P/E ratios. A firm's earnings are dependent on several factors, and the ratio of its profit to sales is called the profit margin. Companies, such as banks or software companies often have higher profit margins since they do not have to deal with expensive inputs for their products unlike manufacturing or industrial firms. These costs also affect the P/E ratio, and hence, each industry has its own ratios.To understand this principle, consider Aswath Damodaran's collection of P/E ratios of different industries. Capital intensive sectors such as home building, steel manufacturing, and oil and gas exploration and production have current P/E ratios of less than 30. Compare this with the fact that software companies, non-bank financial services, and advertising agencies all have a P/E ratio greater than 100 and you'll understand the need of using peer values in an analysis. Of course, this is not a hard and fast rule when it comes to guessing what a firm's P/E ratio will be. After all, this value also reflects the share price, and for some capital intensive sectors such as aerospace, the market might be valuing the shares sufficiently high enough to cause the P/E ratio to jump.Moving forward to the stock market, it looks like the beast of inflation that has roiled investors might finally be on its way back inside the bottle. Inflation in July came below what analysts were expecting, and to build to this, American consumers seem to be quite optimistic as well. The University of Michigan's consumer survey is a widely used metric to judge what Americans might be expecting for the future. And the survey's latest (and preliminary) results show that the year ahead inflation expectations stand at 3.3% in August to be slightly down from 3.4% in July.For the stock market, August is often a slow month as traders generally choose to enjoy a summer vacation. However, the market does not shut down, and right now, it's looking as if there might be some profit taking going on when it comes to big tech names such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). They rank among the best performing stocks this year, but performance in August has been muted as investors remain uncertain about whether the Federal Reserve might finally stop hiking interest rates especially since core inflation is still not below the central bank's preferred 2% reading.Additionally, the damp market sentiment is being influenced by other factors as well, one of which is the equity risk premium. This measures the difference between the earnings yield of the S&amp;P 500 and the yield of a ten year bond. The number shows how much more investors can expect a stock to yield when compared to a bond, and the data for Q2 shows that the figure fell to nearly 4% by Q2 2023 end - its lowest value since the 2008 Great Recession and financial crisis. This concerning figure shows that stocks might be getting overvalued a bit, which can lead to a surprising correction later on.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best inexpensive stocks to buy right now, out of which the top picks are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right NowSupannee Hickman / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the best inexpensive stocks to buy right now, we made a list of the forty largest companies with a price to trailing earnings ratio of lower than 20 and an average analyst rating of Buy.

29,c3ee133f-1b75-3bdd-a174-91142eabb23b,VFC,2023-08-13,The five-year loss for V.F (NYSE:VFC) shareholders likely driven by its shrinking earnings,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-loss-v-f-nyse-122604000.html,1691929564,STORY,['VFC'],"[Long term investing is the way to go, but that doesn't mean you should hold every stock forever. We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Spare a thought for those who held V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) for five whole years - as the share price tanked 78%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 56%.The recent uptick of 6.2% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. View our latest analysis for V.F In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years over which the share price declined, V.F's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 30% each year. This change in EPS is reasonably close to the 26% average annual decrease in the share price. This implies that the market has had a fairly steady view of the stock. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of V.F's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, V.F's TSR for the last 5 years was -72%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in V.F had a tough year, with a total loss of 54% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand V.F better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with V.F (at least 2 which are concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Richard Carucci, Interim Independent Chairman of Board of the company, who spent a stonking US$764k on stock at an average price of US$19.09. Not only is that a big swing, but it increased their holding size by 34%, which is definitely great to see. View our latest analysis for V.F The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At V.FIn fact, the recent purchase by Richard Carucci was the biggest purchase of V.F shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$20.61. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the V.F insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months V.F insiders were buying shares, but not selling. They paid about US$25.40 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does V.F Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.8% of V.F shares, worth about US$60m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The V.F Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Insiders likely see value in V.F shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing V.F. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for V.F you should be aware of, and 2 of these make us uncomfortable.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Alibaba's 'all-around clean quarter'Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) shares climbed Thursday after the China-based e-commerce giant posted fiscal Q1 adjusted core income Thursday that topped analyst estimates, boosted by strong consumer spending during a major shopping event in China in June.Recent economic data, including numbers earlier this week showing a contraction in consumer prices, have sparked concerns over a sluggish post-pandemic recovery in China, the world's second-largest economy.But combined revenues at Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall retail platforms still grew by 12% in the June quarter to 114.95B yuan (1 yuan = $0.1387), fueled by increased purchasing activity during the 618 shopping festival.Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud division rose to 25.12B yuan thanks in part to demand for its artificial intelligence computing products, in the latest sign of surging interest in the nascent technology.DZ Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold on this news, and Benchmark - which also calls the stock a buy - called the print an ""all-around clean quarter.""Benchmark added that Alibaba’s new “consumer-centric approach has started bearing early fruit” as the company undergoes “a fundamental turnaround,"" and said it believes ""a sustainable higher margin profile warrants earnings upward revision and a rerating on the stock"" as multiple strategic assets ""are back on a high-growth trajectory.""Benchmark's price target on BABA is $180.U.S.-listed shares closed up 4.6% Thursday, but stepped back 2.1% for the week to $95.72.PayPal breaks new ground with stablecoin launchPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has become the first large financial services company to launch its own stablecoin, as the group looks to fuel the adoption of digital tokens for payments.Story continuesThe stablecoin - a type of crypto token pegged to an asset like the dollar - will be known as PayPal USD and backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, PayPal announced Monday. Paxos Trust Company will issue PayPal USD.Eligible customers in the U.S. will now be able to purchase PayPal USD to make transfers between PayPal and external wallets, send person-to-person payments, and fund purchases.The move comes as PayPal, which has been impacted by an easing in online spending after the pandemic, attempts to boost the digital payment options available to customers. Shares are down 40% over the past year - including a 16% slide last week on gross profit concerns after its earnings release - although the stock perked up by 2.7% Monday on the stablecoin news.The stock retreated 2.4% for the week to $61.54.Lyft shares take a wild ride after earningsLYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares seesawed last week on earnings and management commentary, ultimately finishing the week higher.The company said on Wednesday that Q2 adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.16, beating expectations for a $0.01 loss, and revenue of $1.02 billion met the consensus figure. It also sees Q3 revenue of $1.13B to $1.15B, higher than Wall Street estimates.While shares rose initially on Wednesday, they quickly fell during the session on cautious management commentary.Bernstein analysts said the results show that headwinds facing Lyft's business will continue to persist through the rest of the year, but added, ""We appreciate management getting out ahead of the tough Q4 set-up and offering some rough guidance.""Bernstein said investors can now focus on 2024, which it believes should see a reacceleration in revenue, but said: ""the underlying earnings power and FCF generation of the model remain outstanding questions.""Susquehanna said management commentary led ""to another noisy report,"" noting that its ""competitive pricing initiative will continue to weigh on the unit economics, and the upcoming insurance renewals could add some noise on the cost side later in the year.""After its 10% slide Wednesday, however, shares more than erased that loss in the next session after the company said in a blog post that it will start displaying advertisements on its app as it looks to create a more stable source of revenue.The move should help Lyft, whose business is completely dependent on ride-hailing, and it should also boost CEO David Risher's turnaround plans.Lyft said it has partnered with adtech company, Rokt, to sell ads, and that its advertising partners include Bilt Rewards, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Audible, and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Universal Pictures.Shares closed the week up 4.9% to $11.38.Roblox plummets on soft earnings, then picks up a couple upgradesRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) shares were in free fall Wednesday after the company reported a Q2 loss of $0.46 per share, $0.02 worse than the expectations.At the same time, the key metric of bookings came in at $780.7 million versus the $785.4M consensus, and the platform saw Average Daily Active Users (DAUs) rise 25% to 65.5 million.Shares fell 22% on the news Wednesday - a sell-off that triggered upgrades at both Morgan Stanley and Wedbush.Morgan Stanley upped the stock to Equal Weight given what they see as a more balanced risk-reward from current levels.And Wedbush upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37, arguing that Roblox “may have the most compelling growth trajectory among the video game names in our coverage universe after taking into account its user base size, its new products, and the potential to revisit its approach to profits.”“The risk/reward profile has become favorable to the upside,” the analyst said in a note to clients.Shares gained nearly 4% Thursday after the upgrades, but were still down by over 20% for the week to $29.82.Twilio comes in well ahead of targetsTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) recorded Q2 EPS of $0.54, far better than the consensus target of $0.30, and revenue climbed 10% vs. a year earlier to a better-than-expected $1.04 billion.Communications revenue was $913.1M, up 10% year-over-year, while Data &amp; Applications revenue came in at $124.6M, representing a 12% year-over-year increase.For Q3, the company expects EPS in the range of $0.33-$0.37, comfortably above the $0.30 consensus, although it also sees revenue at $998B to $99B, lower than the $1.02B average analyst estimate.Following these results, Argus upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $72, and Barclays hiked the company's price target by $10 to $60 per share.""Messaging volume stabilization supports stronger revenue beat and improving FY24 outlook, but we would like to see more contribution from the Data &amp; Applications segment,"" Bernstein analysts said.Bernstein said that, on an adjusted basis, the guidance is ""the highest quarterly revenue guide they've ever had.""Shares were up 2.2% Wednesday and advanced 1% for the week overall, closing Friday at $61.94.Scott Kanowsky, Senad Karaahmetovic, Liz Moyer, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.***Get ready to supercharge your investment strategy with our exclusive discounts.Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity to access cutting-edge tools, real-time market analysis, and expert insights.

If you want to skip our analysis of the edible oil industry and innovations that come from changing health preferences, read 8 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World. Palm oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed (canola) oil are among the most consumed edible oils in the world. The global edible oil industry has experienced significant growth since the demand for dietary fats and oils has seen a parallel increase. The global edible oil industry was valued at $212.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% between 2022 and 2027 to reach $$268.9 billion by 2027. Of this, the two top global edible oils by consumption, namely palm oil and soybean oil, are the biggest stakeholders. According to Precedence Research, the market value of palm oil was $65.08 billion in 2022, and at a CAGR of 5.2%, it will reach $107.53 billion by 2032. Likewise, the market value of soybean oil was recorded to be $48.16 billion in 2021 and will reach $60.08 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 3.21%, according to Fortune Business Insights.We have already covered some crops that produce the most popular edible oils, like soybean and corn oil, and are absolutely necessary for the world's survival. Learn more in 20 Most Grown Crops In The World.Companies Banking On The Edible Oil Industry Besides their obvious use in food, some of the most consumed edible oils have now found their way into the fuel industry. Green diesel, also called renewable diesel or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), is a biofuel produced from renewable sources. It is produced through a refining method named 'hydrotreating, unlike traditional biodiesel (which is made through transesterification). The feedstocks for green diesel include vegetable oils (like soybean or palm oil), animal fats, and waste residues. Chemically, green diesel is very similar to petroleum-based diesel, so it can be used directly in diesel engines without any modifications.Story continuesGiven the rising demand for green diesel, many companies have started diversifying their edible oil supply chains to allocate some of their stock to biofuels. For instance, to compete in the green diesel market, Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) have announced to build a $350 million soybean crush in Spiritwood, North Dakota. The plant, called Green Bison Soybean Processing Plant, will produce soybean oil to be used as renewable diesel feedstock, among other regular uses. The joint venture is expected to produce 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil that will be then supplied to Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) as a feedstock for renewable diesel. Since Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) has an extensive logistics network and the plant will be in a major soybean-producing region, its production and processing capacity will be unmatched. President of Archer-Daniel-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) 's Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds business, Greg Morris, said:""This exciting new project allows us to partner with North Dakota farmers to further advance the role of agriculture in addressing climate change through the production of low carbon feedstocks for products such as renewable diesel.""Further, the ADM's president of North America Oils, Biodiesel, and Renewable Chemicals, Ken Campbell, added: ""The need for lower-carbon, more sustainable products is one of the fundamental trends underlying ADM's strategy and purpose, and we're proud to continue to scale up our leadership in this critical area.""As the state-of-the-art project of Marathon Petroleum Corp, (NYSE:MPC) and ADM will have a processing capacity of 150,000 soybean bushels per day, it's surely going to be fundamental in the region's self-sufficiency in oil production.Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is another global leader in sourcing and supplying oilseed and grain products. The company operates in the edible oil supply chain by procuring, processing, and distributing oil products. Very recently, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) acquired a state-of-the-art oil refinery from Fuji Oil in Louisiana to expand its foothold in the edible oil market. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) aims to serve its customers through the newly acquired oil facility in the second quarter of 2023. Bunge's President of Food Solutions, Aaron Buettner, said: ""This acquisition delivers on our long-term strategy to expand our value-added oils business by accelerating reach across North America.""We have already covered the 12 Biggest Palm Oil Companies in the World; read this intelligent study to learn about the market's main entities.Let's now proceed with the top edible oils by consumption. 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The WorldOur Methodology We found the world's favorite edible oils from the Food and Agriculture Organization of The United Nations (UN FAO) database. Notably, we used the latest annual production on file of these oils as a proxy of their consumption since there's limited credible data on their per-year use. Also, for two of the most popular cooking oils globally, we derived the consumption figures from their seed production, which we will explain later. Based on our findings, here are the leading edible oils in worldwide consumption: 15. Safflower Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 69517 metric tons Safflower oil is produced from the seeds of the safflower plant (Carthamus tinctorius). Major safflower oil producers include India, the United States, and Mexico. In India, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are the leading safflower-cultivating states because of their appropriate weather. Notably, the oil has witnessed an upsurge in demand due to its health benefits as it is rich in unsaturated fats and low in saturated fats, which resulted in its inclusion in foods and supplements.14. Mustard Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.212 million metric tonsMustard oil is extracted from the seeds of the mustard plant and is a staple in many South Asian cuisines, especially in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. India is the world's largest producer and consumer of mustard oil. The country's Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana states are the primary mustard-cultivating regions. Besides culinary usage, mustard oil is also employed in medicines and has applications in therapeutic massage. Like castor oil, we found the estimated annual consumption of mustard oil based on the fact that the average yield of mustard seeds is 38.5%. With this formula, here's what annual mustard consumption would look like:Mustard seed production in 2021: 0.551 million tonsAverage oil production from mustard seeds: 38.5%0.551 million tons (seed production) x 0.385 (oil content) = 0.212 million tons or 212,135 tons.13. Castor Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.892 million metric tonsCastor oil comes from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant, which is native to tropical areas in Eastern Africa. Owing to agricultural advancements, the plant is now cultivated in other regions as well. For instance, India is a leading producer of castor oil, followed by Brazil and China. Economically, castor oil is also an essential industrial raw material in the manufacture of cosmetics, soaps, lubricants, and some pharmaceuticals. Since there were no official figures on the annual production/consumption of castor oil, we took castor oil seeds' annual production from the UN FAO database. Then, on average, castor oil seeds produce 40-50% oil, so using the mid-point of 47.5% can provide a safe number.So we calculated the annual consumption using this formula:Castor oil seeds = 1.88 million Average oil production from seeds = 47.5%1.88 million tons (seed production) x 0.475 (oil content) = 0.892 million tons or 892,000 tonsThe final consumption figure for castor oil stood at 0.892 million metric tons annually. 12. Flaxseed Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 0.955 million metric tons Linum usitatissimum is the only source of flaxseed oil, which is celebrated for its rich alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content, a form of omega-3 fatty acid. Canada and China dominate flax production, but Russia and Kazakhstan also contribute to global supply. Flaxseed oil's health benefits in cardiovascular wellness and inflammation reduction have recently boosted its demand in health-conscious people.11. Sesame Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 1.34 million metric tons Sesame oil is pressed from sesame seeds and boasts a distinctive nutty aroma. Its flavor profile makes it a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Myanmar, India, and China are top producers of sesame oil and drive its market value up to $4.12 billion. Like other most consumed edible oils, this one also has uses in traditional medicines like Ayurveda. The oil's antioxidant properties have made it a key export commodity in the aforementioned countries.10. Coconut Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 2.61 million metric tons Coconut oil is produced from the kernel of mature coconuts in the Philippines, Indonesia, and India. The major exporters of coconut oil are, again, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. India isn't a major exporter of coconut oil because of its vast domestic consumption.  Notably, coconut has a moderate smoke point, so it is not used for high-heat cooking, like the deep fryers used in commercial kitchens. The oil's moisturizing attributes have made it a staple in skincare and haircare formulations.9. Olive Oil Latest Annual Consumption: 3.37 million metric tonsOlive oil is a cornerstone of Mediterranean diets, where it is pressed from green olives. Unsurprisingly, Spain, Italy, and Greece are the top consumers and prime producers of this cherished oil. The economic influence of olive oil in these regions is also profound, as it shapes agricultural practices and export strategies. Click to continue reading 8 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World.Suggested Articles15 Most Consumed Crops in the World15 Most Consumed Meats in the World15 Most Consumed Cheeses in AmericaDisclosure: None. 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils In The World is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

For more destinations, head on over to Top 5 Medical Tourism Destinations in the World.Every year millions of people travel from one country to another in search of specialized medical care. Likewise, people book trips to countries for various medical procedures, from cosmetic surgery to dental work to orthopedic procedures. The rise of healthcare costs and health tourism destinations that offer quality healthcare perks has given rise to a medical tourism market growing at a compound annual growth rate of 21.1%.While the market was valued at $11.56 billion in 2022, it stagnated significantly following the COVID-19 pandemic that closed borders. The sector experienced a 46.9% decline as people's movement was restricted significantly. The easing of travel restrictions is the catalyst that fueled a bounce back, starting in late 2021, with the market growing from $13.98 billion and expected to be worth $53.51 billion by 2028.According to the Medical Tourism Association, over 14 million people travel to other countries annually for medical care. Technological advancements in the healthcare sector in some countries, characterized by the launch of new medical devices, limited treatment, and non-invasive surgeries, fuel tourism for medical procedures. Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE:CAH) is one of the companies that benefit from a booming medical tourism sector as it offers healthcare services and products around the globe. As people seek treatments in the US, Canada, or Europe, they are likely to leverage one of Cardinal Health's customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, and clinical laboratories. The company provides products and solutions to almost all US hospitals, over 60,000 US pharmacies, and more than 10,000 clinics for specialty doctors. It also offers more than 46,000 products for home healthcare to more than 3.4 million patients. The company has a digital platform to help patients follow their medication plans, reaching over 23 million patients and over 60 payers.Story continuesHCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is another top healthcare stock that benefits from a booming medical tourism sector. HCA had 182 hospitals and about 2,300 sites for outpatient care, such as surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and clinics for doctors, in 20 US states and the UK, as of June 30, 2023. The stock is already up by more than 20% for the year on investing billions of dollars to advance its facilities, systems, and equipment to offer high-quality healthcare services capable of attracting medical tourists. The company has also adopted patient-centered practices, such as providing multilingual staff, cultural sensitivity training, and concierge services, to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of medical tourists.Medical tourism becoming a multibillion empire has seen many countries invest billions of dollars to advance their healthcare systems in the race to attract medical tourists. Healthcare organizations and governments in some of the top medical tourism countries are investing billions of dollars to secure the right tools, resources, and talent to rank higher and attract millions of patients annually.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), which manufactures and markets products that enhance the quality of minimally invasive care, is at the heart of the global medical tourism destination. The top medical tourism destination increasingly relies on the company's da Vinci Surgical System to enable complex surgeries using a minimally invasive approach. As more people flock to these countries, the company benefits from increased sales of its solutions. In addition, disruption in the aviation industry continues to enhance the growth of the medical tourism industry. Low-cost airlines make it easy for people to move between countries in search of various treatment options. With some medical procedures costing six figures in developed countries like the US and the UK, many people are being forced to look elsewhere where the procedures cost as little as four figures. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) is one of the airlines that benefits from Americans traveling to Latin American nations, including Mexico and Argentina, in pursuit of cost-effective medical procedures.  People are increasingly leaving the US to Malaysia, Thailand, Costa Rica other countries in pursuit of dental procedures, plastic surgery, and cancer treatments that cost up to 60% less. In 2020, 290,000 Americans went abroad for dental procedures. Healthcare costs are 80% lower in Malaysia and 70% lower in Mexico compared to the US.According to the Medical and Health Tourism Congress, medical treatment is cheaper in most Asian countries than in private hospitals in the US. For instance, a heart bypass surgery in Thailand costs nearly nine times less at $13000 to $113,000 in the US. Hip replacement in Thailand costs about $7800 compared to $50,000 in the US.  The lower costs of medical care contribute to an increasing number of medical tourists in Asia compared to North America. Medical tourists flock to most countries expecting to save 25% to 75% on various procedures and treatment options. Depending on the country, savings can reach 90% compared to the home country. For instance, medical services in Panama cost between 40% and 70% less than in the US and Canada.Top 20 Medical Tourism Destinations in the WorldAgencies and countries are increasingly setting up less expensive healthcare programs in the race to attract a high volume of foreign visitors from developed countries. The flow of patients from developed countries to other countries in search of affordable treatments is making medical tourism a considerable norm.Amid the robust growth, choosing a healthcare destination is proving to be a big challenge for consumers around the globe. The situation is becoming trickier as the media continues to sell multiple risks of moving from one country to another in pursuit of various medical treatments.Nevertheless, the Medical Tourism Index has sought to make it easy for patients worldwide to make informed decisions on the countries to visit for the best healthcare services. The index evaluates the country's healthcare system and procedures based on various indicators.Our MethodologyOur list of the world's top 20 medical tourism destinations is based on the Medical Tourism Index.

36,2593fbcb-0396-373e-8f60-1c3c1b6121c5,WRK,2023-08-13,"Earnings Update: Westrock Coffee Company, LLC (NASDAQ:WEST) Just Reported Its Second-Quarter Results And Analysts Are Updating Their Forecasts",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-westrock-coffee-company-llc-120805631.html,1691928485,STORY,['WRK'],"[Westrock Coffee Company, LLC (NASDAQ:WEST) just released its latest quarterly report and things are not looking great. It was a pretty negative result overall, with revenues of US$225m missing analyst predictions by 5.8%. Worse, the business reported a statutory loss of US$0.35 per share, much larger than the analysts had forecast prior to the result. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. See our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Westrock Coffee Company's four analysts is for revenues of US$907.4m in 2023. This reflects an okay 2.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory losses are forecast to balloon 65% to US$0.34 per share. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$927.3m and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.018 in 2023. There looks to have been a significant drop in sentiment regarding Westrock Coffee Company's prospects after these latest results, with a minor downgrade to revenues and the analysts now forecasting a loss instead of a profit.There was no major change to the consensus price target of US$14.00, signalling that the business is performing roughly in line with expectations, despite lower earnings per share forecasts. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Westrock Coffee Company, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$15.00 and the most bearish at US$13.00 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Westrock Coffee Company is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.Story continuesOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Westrock Coffee Company's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2023 expected to display 4.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 14% over the past year. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 2.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Westrock Coffee Company's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts are expecting Westrock Coffee Company to become unprofitable next year. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Westrock Coffee Company analysts - going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here.Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Westrock Coffee Company (1 is significant!) that we have uncovered.Have feedback on this article?

38,142b62ae-d584-30fa-8b43-224487f299b0,SNA,2023-08-13,Why You Might Be Interested In Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-snap-incorporated-120558526.html,1691928358,STORY,['SNA'],"[Readers hoping to buy Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Snap-on's shares before the 17th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.62 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.48 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Snap-on has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current share price of $270.34. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Snap-on If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Snap-on paying out a modest 34% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 41% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Snap-on's earnings per share have risen 14% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Snap-on has lifted its dividend by approximately 16% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Snap-on? We love that Snap-on is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Snap-on, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Snap-on is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Snap-on and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

39,92d7244d-5227-36e8-a515-acadd1ce5db1,VZ,2023-08-13,Can Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-110025245.html,1691924425,STORY,['VZ'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:22% = US$22b ÷ US$97b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verizon Communications has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityVerizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.63. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Verizon’s primary goal in the immediate aftermath is to restore basic connectivity so residents and first responders can connect with the critical resources they need.Verizon service has been restored along Hwy-37 in Ulupalakua and Keokea and to the Upcountry (including but not limited to Kula, Pukalani, Makawao, and along the North Shore of Maui). Partial service to a portion of West Maui from Maalaea and the Maui Chin to the South through Lahaina Civic Center to the North.There is significant structural damage to cell sites serving Lahaina, so Verizon engineers are working to move a mobile cell site to restore partial service in that community. Verizon engineers are moving tethered drones into the Western area of Maui today that – when fully deployed – will provide cell service from the air for search, rescue and recovery efforts underway. In the Honokowai area, fiber which connects cell sites to the rest of the network is out of service. Verizon engineers are working to connect those cell sites using a satellite connection instead. Satellite links have far less capacity than the fiber typically used for connecting cell sites to the rest of the network, so customers may experience slower speeds and capacity constraints until fiber connections can be restored.Story continuesAdditional disaster response engineers landed in Maui yesterday, bringing with them deployment network assets. Verizon’s DIRT team (Dedicated Impact Response Team) and MERIT team (Major Emergency Response Incident Team) are also in Maui and responding as the situation evolves.Verizon continues to engage local and state EOC contacts to prioritize restoration and arrange for logistics to bring more equipment to Maui. Verizon disaster recovery teams will continue to be on site today to restore prioritized locations.While Verizon works to restore the network, there may be inconsistent and partial restoration of network coverage. Verizon recommends using text and call and to avoid data-heavy applications.Customer relief:Verizon is offering free device charging and bottled water to customers of any carrier at the Pu`unene retail store located at 80 Ho`okele Street, Suite 440, Kahului, HI 96732.

The fund is currently being used to support communities affected by the wildfires on Maui.Text to Give: Verizon customers can help The Salvation Army in their disaster relief efforts by texting the word WILDFIRES to 52000 and $10 will be added to their Verizon bill and donated to The Salvation Army upon confirmation of the billing zip code. All of the funds raised will provide food, shelter, emotional and spiritual care, and other much-needed services to those affected on the Big Island and Maui.The American Red Cross was first on the scene and “working with officials and partners to provide evacuees with a safe place to stay, food to eat, and emotional support during these challenging times.” They are helping anyone and everyone in need after this disaster. When it’s safe, Red Cross teams will help with damage assessment and prepare to expand relief efforts when needed.You can help the people affected recover by texting HAWAII to 90999 for a one-time $10 donation. 100% of the funds will go directly to immediate emergency assistance and long-term community rebuilding efforts.Supporting our First Responders: Our Verizon Response and Verizon Frontline Crisis Response teams remain available 24/7 to coordinate with first responders.

DWAC's interpretation of this was that by obtaining shareholder approval to extend the liquidation timeline by three months - until September 8, 2024 - it can similarly prolong the agreement's ""Outside Date"" for that same duration.

If you want to skip our analysis of the warehousing industry, then head on over to 5 Best Warehouse and Self-Storage Stocks To Buy. Some sectors are related closely to economic growth, and one such sector is the warehousing industry which serves the needs of manufacturing and logistics companies. Warehouses play a crucial role in these firms' operations. For the manufacturing segment, they can either store raw materials or finished goods before shipment, and for retailers, particularly large firms such as  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), they are the backbone of operations since a warehouse has to be strategically located to ensure that it is placed close to customers and to shipping hubs.Along with being an integral part of corporate operations, warehouses also serve the regular consumer. This is primarily in the form of self-storage units, that allow people to store their prized possessions or other belongings safely and securely. Broadly, warehousing and self-storage facilities are part of the industrial sub segment of the real estate market. Depending on the nature of the operator, these facilities can also be operated by entities called Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) which are specialized firms required to pay out most of their profits as dividends in order to maintain a tax exempt status. For more details on REITs, you should check out 15 Worst Performing REITs in 2023.While on the surface a warehouse might appear to be as glamorous as some other facilities, the sector is one of many that has seen its operations become revitalized due to technology. As part of its functioning, a standard warehouse has several operations. These start from receiving products, storing them, then picking them, packing them, and shipping them as per demand requirements. And in each of these stages of operations, technology has started to play its role. Warehouse personnel have come to rely extensively on robots these days to aid them in picking or sorting goods. Additionally, a warehouse's floor layout is also optimized depending on the nature of its products and the product flow. For consumer oriented warehouses, such as those operated by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the flow of products from entry to exit is different than say for industrial warehouses that hold raw materials or finished goods for industrial companies.Story continuesThe warehousing sector is quite important these days when we consider the turmoil that has roiled the real estate sector. This imbalance and slowdown in the industry has been primarily due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes since not only do builders require easy access to cheap capital for building large projects, but property management companies also need to secure long term credit for mega projects. A high interest rate increases the short term borrowing costs for construction firms, and it impacts the management firms too since writers of long term credits might be unwilling to issue new instruments until they have a clear picture of long term interest rates. The high rate environment coupled with the changed dynamics industry has hit the office real estate segment particularly hard and already caused some debt defaults by large companies.The office real state space is facing difficulties in reversing the losses it has faced since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent impact that work at home trends had on office occupancy. As an illustration of this turmoil, consider the fact that delinquencies in the office sector touched 5% in July 2023 as they more than doubled over the year-ago figures. However, considering the delinquency rates only the industrial real estate segment is performing relatively well despite a high interest rate environment since its delinquency rate is the lowest in the industry and actually dropped in July.However, the broader industrial and manufacturing sector paints a different picture. This segment is crucial to the health of the warehousing industry since higher output naturally increases the demand for warehousing. Data from the Institute For Supply Management (ISM) shows that July marked the 9th consecutive month of a decline in the manufacturing sector in America. At the same time, producer inflation is also going up, which is fueling worries that the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation might not be over since higher producer prices have the potential to translate into higher prices for the consumer down the road.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best warehousing and self-storage stocks to buy based on hedge fund interest. Some top warehousing and self-storage stock picks in this list are Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BJ), and WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.

Dividend payouts are a great way to give you some extra income. I always appreciate a company that takes care of its shareholders by paying a respectable dividend.Other investors will reinvest those dividends into their portfolios, where they can grow their positions even quicker and build out their portfolios. These investors are usually pre-retirement, but the practice can lift your investments and make your retirement more comfortable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut to count on this kind of income, it’s essential that your dividend stocks be consistent and reliable. The worst thing an income investor can face is to find out that their quarterly payment is cut or, even worse, vanishes.You don’t have to worry about that kind of scenario with the following stocks. They all have good grades in my Portfolio Grader and my Dividend Grader tool.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a snack-food company cooking up some pretty tasty returns. And the dividend is just the icing on the cake.Mondelez has some popular brands, including Oreo cookies, Cadbury candies and Toblerone chocolate. Revenue and earnings are strong as the company is riding some price increases to improved profitability.Revenue in Q2 was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was 76 cents, both better than analysts’ expectations for $8.19 billion and 69 cents EPS.The company offers a dividend yield of 2.2%, with increases in the last 11 years. With a payout ratio of 48%, the dividend seems secure.MDLZ stock is up 13% this year. It has “A” ratings in both the Portfolio Grader and Dividend Grader.Story continuesConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comUpstream oil and gas company ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) probably isn’t the first oil company you think of. But if you’re looking for dependable dividend stocks, then maybe it should be.ConocoPhillips explores, produces, transports and markets oil, natural gas and liquified natural gas. The Houston company operates in 13 countries, producing 1.79 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first six months of the year.There’s plenty more where that comes from. COP says it has 6.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserve.Earnings for the second quarter include $12.88 billion in revenue and $1.94 in earnings per share. Both fell below analysts’ estimates, which isn’t horribly surprising considering that oil prices have been lower this year.But despite that, the dividends continue to flow. ConocoPhillips distributed $5.8 billion in dividends and buybacks so far this year and plans to distribute $11 billion by the end of the year.COP has a dividend yield of 1.7% and the payout’s increased annually for the last six years. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Halliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comI’ve had my eye on Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) for a while now. Thanks to elevated energy prices, the oilfield equipment and services company had a good 2022. And while those prices dipped slightly in 2023, I still think the company’s in good shape.Halliburton’s revenue continues to be on a steady projected increase. The company reported $20.3 billion in revenue last year and is expecting $23.7 billion this year and then $25.8 billion in 2024.Q2 earnings came in at $5.8 billion, up 14% from a year ago. And while the company narrowly missed analysts’ estimates for revenue, it managed an earnings beat by recording EPS of 77 cents while the Street expected 75 cents.HAL stock also provides a dividend yield of 1.6%. The stock is up 38% since mid-May and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a big company on the verge of getting bigger. The semiconductor company has a deal to buy cloud computing company VMWare (NYSE:VMW) for $69 billion. The transaction already has a preliminary OK from regulators in the U.K.I like the deal for Broadcom because of what it means for the company’s work in artificial intelligence.AI, particularly generative AI, is the hot sector on Wall Street right now, and any company worth its salt is working on ways to incorporate AI into its processes.VMWare helps integrate multi-cloud systems, which are getting more important as more companies work on AI and embrace a cloud networking system. And Broadcom says that its semiconductor revenue from AI businesses should grow from 15% to 25% next year.Broadcom stock is up more than 90% this year and has a dividend yield of 2%. It gets “A” ratings in both the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.Scorpio Tankers (STNG)A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San FranciscoSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.comBased in Monaco, Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) is an international shipping company. It transports refined petroleum products and crude oil by sea.The company operates a fleet of 112 tankers with an average fleet age of less than eight years. The company says keeping a modern, efficient fleet helps make it a good corporate citizen. It has lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of material transported. And it takes its ESG responsibilities seriously, meeting or exceeding ESG-related guidelines.This should be a good year for shippers like Scorpio. The International Energy Agency says global oil demand is projected to hit 102.1 million barrels daily this year, which would be a record high.Much of that growth is projected to be in China, which is easing long-standing Covid restrictions.The company reported Q2 revenue of $329.3 million and net income of $132.4 million, or $2.40 per share.It also provides a dividend yield of 2%.STNG stock can be volatile. You can expect plenty of hills and valleys as the stock price will fluctuate with the energy market. But as a dividend stock, STNG is reliable. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Paccar (PCAR)A sign for Paccar (PCAR) in front of greenery.Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comBased in Bellevue, Washington, Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) designs and manufactures premium heavy- and medium-duty trucks.

It helps keep the economy going.Results for the second quarter included $8.88 billion in revenue and earnings of $1.22 billion, with a net income of $2.33 per share.

With a major portion of the global populace now vaccinated against Covid viruses, the positive additions to the revenue for healthcare companies is finally blowing over. Despite that, the sector hasn’t lost its importance and is poised for further growth in the future.The S&amp;P 500 Health Care Index, which tracks the performance of healthcare companies included in the S&amp;P 500 Index, has lost nearly 1.0% of its value year-to-date, as compared to a 16.39% growth for the S&amp;P 500 Index.The decline in healthcare stock prices can be attributed to multiple factors including the global macroeconomic environment, slowdown in the initial public offering (IPO) markets, as well as a decline in M&amp;A activity across the industry. During the first five months of 2023, pharmaceutical and biotech companies spent $85 billion on acquisitions, compared to a measly $35.6 billion in the same period of 2022.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Tractor Supply How Fast Is Tractor Supply Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Tractor Supply's EPS has grown 20% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Tractor Supply maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 11% to US$15b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Tractor Supply's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Tractor Supply Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$24b company like Tractor Supply. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$59m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Tractor Supply, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Tractor Supply's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$10m in the year leading up to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Should You Add Tractor Supply To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Tractor Supply's strong EPS growth. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that Tractor Supply is worth keeping an eye on. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Tractor Supply that we have uncovered.Although Tractor Supply certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Dividend payouts are a great way to give you some extra income. I always appreciate a company that takes care of its shareholders by paying a respectable dividend.Other investors will reinvest those dividends into their portfolios, where they can grow their positions even quicker and build out their portfolios. These investors are usually pre-retirement, but the practice can lift your investments and make your retirement more comfortable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut to count on this kind of income, it’s essential that your dividend stocks be consistent and reliable. The worst thing an income investor can face is to find out that their quarterly payment is cut or, even worse, vanishes.You don’t have to worry about that kind of scenario with the following stocks. They all have good grades in my Portfolio Grader and my Dividend Grader tool.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a snack-food company cooking up some pretty tasty returns. And the dividend is just the icing on the cake.Mondelez has some popular brands, including Oreo cookies, Cadbury candies and Toblerone chocolate. Revenue and earnings are strong as the company is riding some price increases to improved profitability.Revenue in Q2 was $8.5 billion and earnings per share was 76 cents, both better than analysts’ expectations for $8.19 billion and 69 cents EPS.The company offers a dividend yield of 2.2%, with increases in the last 11 years. With a payout ratio of 48%, the dividend seems secure.MDLZ stock is up 13% this year. It has “A” ratings in both the Portfolio Grader and Dividend Grader.Story continuesConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comUpstream oil and gas company ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) probably isn’t the first oil company you think of. But if you’re looking for dependable dividend stocks, then maybe it should be.ConocoPhillips explores, produces, transports and markets oil, natural gas and liquified natural gas. The Houston company operates in 13 countries, producing 1.79 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first six months of the year.There’s plenty more where that comes from. COP says it has 6.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserve.Earnings for the second quarter include $12.88 billion in revenue and $1.94 in earnings per share. Both fell below analysts’ estimates, which isn’t horribly surprising considering that oil prices have been lower this year.But despite that, the dividends continue to flow. ConocoPhillips distributed $5.8 billion in dividends and buybacks so far this year and plans to distribute $11 billion by the end of the year.COP has a dividend yield of 1.7% and the payout’s increased annually for the last six years. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Halliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comI’ve had my eye on Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) for a while now. Thanks to elevated energy prices, the oilfield equipment and services company had a good 2022. And while those prices dipped slightly in 2023, I still think the company’s in good shape.Halliburton’s revenue continues to be on a steady projected increase. The company reported $20.3 billion in revenue last year and is expecting $23.7 billion this year and then $25.8 billion in 2024.Q2 earnings came in at $5.8 billion, up 14% from a year ago. And while the company narrowly missed analysts’ estimates for revenue, it managed an earnings beat by recording EPS of 77 cents while the Street expected 75 cents.HAL stock also provides a dividend yield of 1.6%. The stock is up 38% since mid-May and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a big company on the verge of getting bigger. The semiconductor company has a deal to buy cloud computing company VMWare (NYSE:VMW) for $69 billion. The transaction already has a preliminary OK from regulators in the U.K.I like the deal for Broadcom because of what it means for the company’s work in artificial intelligence.AI, particularly generative AI, is the hot sector on Wall Street right now, and any company worth its salt is working on ways to incorporate AI into its processes.VMWare helps integrate multi-cloud systems, which are getting more important as more companies work on AI and embrace a cloud networking system. And Broadcom says that its semiconductor revenue from AI businesses should grow from 15% to 25% next year.Broadcom stock is up more than 90% this year and has a dividend yield of 2%. It gets “A” ratings in both the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.Scorpio Tankers (STNG)A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San FranciscoSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.comBased in Monaco, Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) is an international shipping company. It transports refined petroleum products and crude oil by sea.The company operates a fleet of 112 tankers with an average fleet age of less than eight years. The company says keeping a modern, efficient fleet helps make it a good corporate citizen. It has lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of material transported. And it takes its ESG responsibilities seriously, meeting or exceeding ESG-related guidelines.This should be a good year for shippers like Scorpio. The International Energy Agency says global oil demand is projected to hit 102.1 million barrels daily this year, which would be a record high.Much of that growth is projected to be in China, which is easing long-standing Covid restrictions.The company reported Q2 revenue of $329.3 million and net income of $132.4 million, or $2.40 per share.It also provides a dividend yield of 2%.STNG stock can be volatile. You can expect plenty of hills and valleys as the stock price will fluctuate with the energy market. But as a dividend stock, STNG is reliable.

59,3a3833fb-1419-3eaf-a6b9-df4ebfe8c48b,OXY,2023-08-13,An excellent week for Occidental Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:OXY) institutional owners who own 55% as one-year returns inch higher,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/excellent-week-occidental-petroleum-corporations-120032205.html,1691928032,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Occidental Petroleum's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 5 shareholders own 53% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 55% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$58b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 1.2% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Occidental Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Occidental Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 25%. With 10% and 6.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Dodge &amp; Cox and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$160m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Occidental Petroleum. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 25% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Occidental Petroleum is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit concerning...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Ulta Beauty’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) shareholders have enjoyed a 76% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 49% (not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.3% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Waste Management, it has a TSR of 93% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 4.0% in the last year, Waste Management shareholders lost 4.7% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 14% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Waste Management .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) shareholders have seen the share price rise 44% over three years, well in excess of the market return (26%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 13% in the last year , including dividends .On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.LyondellBasell Industries was able to grow its EPS at 2.3% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of LyondellBasell Industries, it has a TSR of 74% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that LyondellBasell Industries has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 13% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 3% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

You must always keep in mind that the ultra-wealthy play by a different set of rules. To these top-tier powerbrokers, losing a few million on trades might not seem like much. However, to most regular folks, that would be absolutely crippling.Still, what I do appreciate about top stocks billionaires load up on is that the rich didn’t get this way because they had a penchant for losing money. No, these folks aim to go to the “big dance” every time. And with those handy 13F disclosures, you might be able to get a piece of the pie.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn that compelling note, below are the top stocks billionaires are buying.Apple (AAPL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comRepresenting easily one of the most popular consumer technology brands in the world, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) requires no introduction. Because of its prominence, it’s no surprise that AAPL ranks among the top stocks billionaires are buying. In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) – led by CEO Warren Buffett – acquired $3.01 billion worth of shares, per HedgeFollow.According to data from Stockcircle, Apple represents 49.27% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio. It’s also the conglomerate’s biggest holding. Further, the Oracle of Omaha loves the tech giant. As Barron’s stated, Buffett appreciates that Apple keeps repurchasing stock and thereby increasing Berkshire’s percentage ownership with no effort on the latter entity’s part.To be fair, Apple isn’t a perfect idea among billionaires’ favorite stocks. Several days ago, the semiconductor space fell sharply because of concerns associated with fading smartphone demand. Still, in the long run, Apple’s brand power should resonate with the market. Therefore, it’s a reasonably comfortable buy.Story continuesAmazon (AMZN)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptosSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn e-commerce enterprise that quickly evolved into a tech behemoth, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) carries a controversial profile. Basically, it’s a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking the life out of mom-and-pop businesses. Then again, that “quality” might make AMZN an idea play among the top stocks billionaires are buying. In particular, AMZN caught the eye of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).Per data compiled by HedgeFollow, the big bank acquired $1.9 billion worth of shares during Q2. Overall, the total value bought among all investors during the aforementioned period came out to $26.44 billion. Of course, JPMorgan is led by billionaire business executive Jamie Dimon.Interestingly, Dimon calls Amazon a “business miracle,” according to a CNN report. As well, the banker enjoys a long relationship with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, Executive Chairman, and former president and CEO.Financially, AMZN runs a little hot in terms of earnings multiples. However, the company remains a growth machine after all this time, posting a three-year revenue growth rate of 21.9%. Thus, it’s one of the top stocks billionaires load up on.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7If there’s any one enterprise that we all couldn’t live without, it might be Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Politically and ideologically, a good many of us are skeptical about the tech stalwart’s unparalleled influence. At the same time, this gargantuan footprint makes GOOG one of the top stocks billionaires are buying.In particular, Dan Loeb of Third Point has been a huge believer in Alphabet and its Google ecosystem. According to Loeb’s latest 13F disclosure, the Internet giant represents 8.06% of Third Point’s holdings, amounting to 4.75 million shares owned.Currently, GOOG trades at a slightly worse-than-average premium relative to both trailing and forward earnings multiples. However, based on its 10-year discounted cash flow (DCF) model, GOOG could be undervalued. Per investment data aggregator Gurufocus, GOOG’s fair value stands at $147.50, implying a margin of safety of 12.71%. In addition, Alphabet continues to be a growth machine, printing a three-year sales expansion rate of 22.9%. Therefore, it’s a strong idea for billionaires’ favorite stocks.GE HealthCare (GEHC)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSpun off from industrial conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) early this year, GE HealthCare (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a multinational medical technology firm. Per its website, the enterprise represents a leader in precision care, infusing innovation with patient-focused technologies to facilitate better care. What’s more, GEHC enjoyed a strong debut so far, gaining nearly 36% of equity value.Backing GE HealthCare is the billionaire Chairman and CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Larry Fink. During Q2, BlackRock acquired $1.88 billion worth of GEHC stock. Overall, institutional investors acquired just over $22 billion of the GE spinoff.Even more interesting, data from Gurufocus shows that GEHC could be undervalued. Right now, shares trade hands at 20.53x trailing earnings, below the sector median of 26.8x. Also, the market prices GEHC at 20.04x forward earnings, below the sector median of 24.51x. In addition, the company enjoys strong profit margins, particularly a trailing-year net margin of 9.62%. Therefore, it’s a reasonable idea for top stocks billionaires are buying.Microsoft (MSFT)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA powerhouse technology giant specializing in both software applications and compelling hardware, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) arguably makes sense in any context. It’s good to know that the top dogs also feel the same. Easily ranking among the top stocks billionaires are buying, Microsoft saw tremendous buying activity in Q2. Overall, institutional investors poured in $32.4 billion during the three months ended June 30.In particular, Chase Coleman III from Tiger Global Management continues to be a strong billionaire supporter of MSFT. According to the latest 13F disclosure, MSFT represents Tiger’s biggest holding at 15.57% of its portfolio. This figure translates to 5.93 million shares of the tech giant. As well, during Q2, Tiger acquired over 674,000 shares.Moving forward, I expect great things from Microsoft. As you know, the company entered into a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of the ChatGPT chatbot. With artificial intelligence becoming a prominent element in society, MSFT should rise higher after it works out its near-term funk. Thus, it’s one of the top stocks billionaires load up on.Salesforce (CRM)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA cloud-based software enterprise, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) specializes in customer relationship management software and applications; hence, its ticker symbol. Mainly, the company focuses on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development. It’s been a rough period since 2022’s interest rate hike campaign. Still, shares are flying right now, gaining 60% since the January opener.Under this context, it’s perhaps not surprising that CRM represents one of the top stocks billionaires are buying. Indeed, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital is a huge fan. Interestingly, Lone Pine went on a divesting spree, heavily trimming exposure to securities across its portfolio. However, CRM ranked among major portfolio acquisitions, with the firm increasing its holdings by nearly 271%.Financially, CRM trades at a hefty premium to trailing earnings. And it’s not exactly cheap on a forward earnings basis. However, the company benefits from a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 16.1%. Thus, CRM is one of the billionaires’ favorite stocks.Nvidia (NVDA)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comAlthough a well-respected and powerful name in the broader semiconductor business, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) right now cuts a controversial figure. No, it’s a fine enterprise. However, investors may be pricing NVDA at a level that’s not reasonable based on credible expectations. For example, NVDA presently trades at trailing earnings multiple of nearly 232. Shares also trade at 60X forward earnings.Adding some consternation, while shares gained over 200% this year, momentum may be fading. In the trailing five sessions ending Aug. 3, NVDA lost almost 5% of equity value. Nevertheless, the tech giant continues to rank among the top stocks billionaires are buying.Per the latest 13F disclosure, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management remains a believer in Nvidia. Presently, NVDA represents 9.2% of Coatue’s portfolio, translating to 4.98 million shares owned. Further, in Q2, the investment firm increased its exposure by 7.36%.Frankly, Nvidia is one of the toughest calls for billionaires’ favorite stocks. Still, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 34.5%, the prospects certainly entice speculators.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Procter &amp; Gamble. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Procter &amp; Gamble, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Procter &amp; Gamble. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.3% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$192m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 34% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

DWAC's interpretation of this was that by obtaining shareholder approval to extend the liquidation timeline by three months - until September 8, 2024 - it can similarly prolong the agreement's ""Outside Date"" for that same duration.

72,2abb638d-b044-3e1a-8ec8-d6286ec04f57,CSCO,2023-08-13,25 Most Congested Cities in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-congested-cities-us-143954092.html,1691851194,STORY,"['TRN', 'CSCO', 'ACM']","[In this article, we’ll take a detailed look at the 25 Most Congested Cities in the US, with insights into overall traffic congestion and its impact on various sectors. For a quick overview of the top 10, head over to the 10 Most Congested Cities in the US.Traffic congestion has grown hand-in-hand with urban development. As cities expand and populations increase, so too do the number of vehicles that navigate urban streets and highways. In the US, with its vast urban landscapes and ever-growing population centers, congestion is not just an inconvenience, but it also impacts the economy, environment, and people’s lives.According to the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), congestion leads to billions of dollars lost annually in terms of wasted fuel and lost productivity. When vehicles idle in traffic or move at slower speeds, more fuel is consumed, driving up the costs for businesses and consumers alike.The toll is equally concerning from an environmental perspective. Congested roads lead to vehicles spending more time idling, which in turn, results in higher greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has noted that transportation, particularly road traffic, is a significant contributor to the US's carbon footprint.Population density and the demand on the transportation infrastructure also play a significant role in causing congestion. For instance, New York City, with over 8 million residents squeezed into just over 300 square miles, is a classic example of how high urban densities can damage road networks. But it's not only about population.Outdated infrastructure, inadequate public transport systems, and urban areas designed without the anticipation of current vehicle demand further compound the issue.The Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute's Urban Mobility Report reveals that over the years, there has been a constant rise in the average hours Americans spend stuck in traffic.Story continuesThe American’s deep-rooted preference for personal vehicles is a notable factor contributing to this congestion. Data from the US Census Bureau illustrates that a major segment of the American workforce chooses to commute by car, and many do so without carpooling. This, combined with certain cities having underdeveloped public transport networks, places a heavier dependence on roadways, further intensifying congestion.Which City has the Worst Traffic in the WorldTraffic congestion is a global challenge, with many urban centers struggling with the snarl of bumper-to-bumper vehicles, particularly during rush hours. The crown for the world's worst traffic, however, is highly contested and can change annually due to various factors ranging from infrastructure development to population surges.According to the TomTom 2022 Traffic Index, London takes the top spot when it comes to average travel time, followed by Bangaluru, Dublin, Sapporo, and Milan. Astonishingly, traversing just 10 kilometers in London takes an average of 36 minutes and 20 seconds, making it one of the worst traffic cities. This is roughly the time it might take to watch an entire episode of a TV sitcom, all while covering a distance that's less than a quarter of the length of the English Channel!INRIX echoes this sentiment. Their 2022 Global Traffic Scorecard rankings highlight London as the city enduring the highest delays by time, followed by Chicago, Paris, and Boston. Londoners face a staggering 156 hours of delay annually due to traffic congestion.While the title of the city with the world's worst traffic may be in flux, one thing remains constant: the urgent need for urban centers to innovate, adapt, and find sustainable solutions to their traffic challenges.Solutions to Reduce Traffic CongestionTraffic congestion in the major urban hubs is not just a testament to growing populations and urban sprawl; it's a call to action for infrastructure development.Companies like Bechtel, Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR), and AECOM (NYSE:ACM) have a history of executing large-scale projects.
