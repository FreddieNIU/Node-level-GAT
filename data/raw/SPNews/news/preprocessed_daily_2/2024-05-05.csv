These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said:', '“There are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few. All of which we have little to no control over.”', 'As a result of this, some of the biggest banks such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) have been crystal ball gazing and predicting declines in their net interest income(NII) for 2024. On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks’ improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies.

It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 3.7% to hit US$4.4b. MGM Resorts International also reported a statutory profit of US$0.67, which was an impressive 29% above what the analysts had forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from MGM Resorts International's 19 analysts is for revenues of US$17.1b in 2024. This would reflect a credible 2.8% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to fall 11% to US$2.53 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$16.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.26 in 2024. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the nice gain to earnings per share expectations following these results."", ""The consensus price target was unchanged at US$56.25, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on MGM Resorts International, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$66.00 and the most bearish at US$46.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that MGM Resorts International's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 3.7% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 10% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.7% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than MGM Resorts International."", ""The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards MGM Resorts International following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that MGM Resorts International's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on MGM Resorts International. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for MGM Resorts International going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Given that we are looking at Microchip Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.419. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

(NYSE:IT) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 4.5% to US$429 in the week after its latest quarterly results. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$1.5b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Gartner surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$2.67 per share, a notable 16% above expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Gartner after the latest results."", ' View our latest analysis for Gartner ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Gartner's nine analysts is for revenues of US$6.24b in 2024. This reflects a reasonable 4.4% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 2.4% to US$10.51. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.36b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$10.51 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", 'The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$478, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Gartner analyst has a price target of US$529 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$421. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Gartner is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.', ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Gartner's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 6.0% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 9.1% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.5% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Gartner is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Gartner's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Morgan Stanley's\xa0Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024."", 'With the upcoming U.S. election season looming, the Federal Reserve has attempted to chart a course of interest rate cuts, banking on the assumption that inflation will eventually be reined in. However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.', 'The first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick\'s inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman\'s focus on wealth management. Pick\'s tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank\'s shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an ""existential reality"" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street\'s awaited recovery in investment banking. While Morgan Stanley\'s resurgence in investment banking trailed some of its competitors—Goldman Sachs saw a 32% increase in fees—Pick remained optimistic.', '""I’m feeling good about this being early-to-mid cycle for the classic investment banking, capital markets business around the world,"" said Pick, who succeeded long-serving chief James Gorman in January.', 'See also: Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024.', ""The results underscored the prowess of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm, which has been pivotal in driving the bank's growth in recent years, particularly evident in its ability to attract significant new client assets. This led to the bank's first-quarter profits surging by 14% year-over-year to $3.41 billion, or $2.02 per share, with each of its three main divisions contributing to the growth, while revenue increased by 4% to $15.14 billion. Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees."", ""Speaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:"", 'Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII. Assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter. Our strategy is working. We have a clear path to $10 trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management. We remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice, deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable 30% pretax profits over time. Investment Management reported revenues of $1.4 billion increasing 7% versus the prior year. Results reflect higher asset management revenues, which increased 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in average AUM on higher market levels.', 'We continue to expect our 2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which similar to prior years will exhibit some quarter to quarter volatility. The first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves, our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do.

These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks.

On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders.

Moody's beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$1.8b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 14%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", "" See our latest analysis for Moody's "", ""After the latest results, the 17 analysts covering Moody's are now predicting revenues of US$6.54b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a credible 4.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 7.3% to US$9.89. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.54b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.85 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$407, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Moody's analyst has a price target of US$450 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$345. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that Moody's' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 6.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 5.0% p.a. over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 5.7% annually. Moody's is expected to grow at about the same rate as its industry, so it's not clear that we can draw any conclusions from its growth relative to competitors."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Moody's. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Moody's analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Moody's  you should be aware of."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Nvidia technically pays one too, but at a negligible 0.02% yield, it\'s a nonfactor to investors.', ""Alphabet's dividend will start at just $0.20 per share, but the company said it intends to sustain this quarterly payout into the future, meaning it could build off this initial level."", ""At a share price of about $166 as of this writing, Alphabet's forward yield is 0.5%, on par with its Magnificent Seven peers."", ""Let's discuss why dividends matter for big-tech companies and the other way Alphabet plans to directly reward its shareholders."", ""Despite yielding just 0.8%, Microsoft pays out more cash in dividends than any other U.S.-based company: $20.7 billion in the past year. The company with the second largest amount of dividends paid is Apple at $15.1 billion. Meta's dividend expense should be about $5.1 billion in its first year, while Alphabet will pay out just shy of $10 billion."", ""That adds up to a combined $50 billion paid out annually to shareholders between the four companies. While that's a massive amount of capital, these companies tend to spend even more on stock buybacks."", ""Using profits to repurchase shares, even when the stock is trading near an all-time high, can benefit shareholders more than dividends in the long run. Shareholders owe taxes on dividend income but not buybacks. The latter also reduces the outstanding share count, increasing earnings per share and decreasing the company's dividend liability over time."", ""Dividends matter for mature growth stocks like Alphabet because they make the company a complete investment. The $0.80 per share in annual dividends looks trivial when Alphabet stock has nearly doubled since the start of 2023. However, a company's ability to pay a growing dividend and buy back stock when market sentiment is negative can be a reassuring and effective use of capital."", ""It's also worth mentioning that Alphabet's dividend could be way higher if it didn't buy back stock. Alphabet's board just authorized a $70 billion buyback program. Annualizing its $15.7 billion of share repurchases from the first quarter and adding the $10 billion of expected dividends results in a total of $72.8 billion going to its capital return program. That's good for a capital return yield of 3.4%, a much more generous yield than the dividend alone. This is the case for Meta, Microsoft, and Apple as well."", 'Accounting for the full capital return program, not just dividends, better illustrates how much companies like Alphabet are returning to their shareholders.', ""With a market capitalization measured in the trillions, it's hard to believe a company as big as Alphabet can continue to outperform the broad market. But once you consider all the advantages of big tech companies, it's clear why the trend can continue."", 'Unlike a stodgy dividend-paying company with limited growth prospects, Alphabet is a high-margin business with an excellent balance sheet. It has plenty of avenues to expand existing cash cows like YouTube, Google Search, Google Cloud, and Android, or invest in new opportunities like artificial intelligence.', 'Even after a strong rally the past year, Alphabet trades at a 25.5 price-to-earnings ratio compared to 24.8 for the S&P 500.

These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said:', '“There are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few.

S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders.

You can see how Caterpillar's dividend payout ratio surges higher during down years:"", 'Caterpillar has repeatedly proven it can navigate these rough waters. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years, which means it survived not only COVID-19 but also the financial crisis in 2008-2009. Today, the payout ratio is at its lowest point in a decade, which has Caterpillar prepared for the next downturn. You can buy and hold Caterpillar with confidence.', ""Energy is the foundation of the world's economy, and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) plays a significant role in North America. The energy company operates a network of pipelines and storage for oil and gas that spans North America from its headquarters in northern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Enbridge also has additional businesses in renewable energy generation and a gas utility segment."", ""Pipelines are Enbridge's primary business. These lines transfer oil, gas, and other materials throughout North America.

This makes Enbridge a more consistent business.

Investors should look to the company's distributable cash flow (DCF) per share, which management uses to communicate how well the business is doing. Enbridge's DCF per share will be around $5.60 this year, and the company will pay around $3.66 per share.

The company beat sales predictions by 7.5% and earnings estimates by 10%, yet Lockheed stock ended the week below where it began.', 'Is that fair?', ""For Q1 2024, Lockheed earned $6.39 on sales of $17.2 billion. Sales increased nearly 14% year over year, but earnings declined a bit -- down about 3% year over year. Free cash flow came in even lower than reported earnings. That's the opposite of what you'd expect to happen, so to an extent it actually was fair for investors to not bid up Lockheed stock despite the company beating expectations."", ""Why didn't Lockheed do even better in Q1? And why are investors upset with it despite the beat?"", ""Strange as it is to say since we're in the middle of a global bull market for weapons systems, in general, and for missiles, in particular, but Lockheed's sole underperforming business in Q1 was its missiles and fire control division. Out of Lockheed's four main divisions, each of which enjoyed growing sales in the quarter, the missiles business was the only one to show declining profits -- down 18%, despite sales climbing 25%."", ""The reason? Lockheed is working hard to ramp up production of pretty much every kind of missile it makes: Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM), and PAC-3 Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors, too. Presumably, it's the very same production expansion that's both enabling higher revenue growth and entailing costs that depress profits."", 'As for the other divisions, aeronautics sales grew 9%, space 10%, and rotary and mission systems 16%. Profits grew in each of these three units, with the biggest improvement seen in space (profits up 16%) and rotary -- profits up 25%. Aeronautics was the outlier, showing good sales growth but little improvement in profits, belying hopes that the F-35 fighter jet program would get steadily more profitable as it scales up in size.', 'I want to say a few words on Lockheed\'s space business -- space being the industry I focus on. Lockheed is the world\'s biggest pure-play defense company, so it\'s no surprise that its ""space"" business is primarily military in nature. The company cited higher Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) production, as well as money from its just-won $17.7 billion Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) project as contributing to revenue growth, as well as $115 million from ""national security"" satellites.', 'Lockheed also mentioned that it booked $30 million in profit from its 50-50 ownership (alongside Boeing) of United Launch Alliance. After launching just three rockets in all of 2023, ULA launched once in Q1 2024 and again at the start of Q2 2024. Management credited this ""higher launch volume"" for contributing a bit more profit to its bottom line.', 'More important to investors is that, because we know that (1) ULA launched only one single rocket in the quarter, (2) Lockheed got half the profit from that launch, and (3) this profit was $30 million, we can presume that this launch earned a total profit of $60 million for ULA.', ""ULA is a private space company, so it's difficult to gauge its profitability. But thanks to Lockheed's earnings report, we can now put a tentative value on each launch the company conducts -- $60 million -- and apply that to the rates the government pays the company for future launches to at least guess at a profit margin. And of course, we can compare that amount to the profit margin of Lockheed's publicly traded space rivals to determine whether ULA is winning or losing the space race."", ""Now that Lockheed has let this secret slip, let's make sure to remember it."", ""As for the rest of Lockheed Martin, based on last week's data, we know the stock sells for about 17 times trailing earnings and 1.7 times trailing sales. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin averaged only about a 1.2x price-to-sales ratio over the first 20 years of this 21st Century -- so a 1.7x sales ratio seems on the expensive side, historically. Regarding earnings, however, Lockheed stock usually trades closer to a 22 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) than its current 17 P/E, implying that from a profits perspective, Lockheed stock is historically cheap."", ""As a conservative investor, I'm inclined to avoid Lockheed because of its high price-to-sales ratio (P/S). That being said, if Lockheed can keep its profit margins as high as they currently are, I might be persuaded its stock is actually a buy."", 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them.

They may be blue chips, but that doesn't necessarily make them great picks right now."", ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5% last month. That setback doesn't hold a candle to the losses some of its constituents suffered, though.

Its first-quarter results released in late April, however, ultimately validated that selling. Revenue fell 8% year over year as continued design and manufacturing problems with its newer 737 and 787 jets crimped demand. The company also booked a heavy loss of $355 million, reminding investors that these headaches aren't mere nuisances -- there's a clear financial cost to them. Then, there's the added disruption of an impending CEO switch. Current chief executive Dave Calhoun will be stepping down at the end of the year, but there's already drama regarding who should replace him."", ""IBM's setback is also mostly earnings-related, although the announcement it will be acquiring cloud software company HashiCorp didn't help. First-quarter earnings of $1.68 per share topped estimates of $1.60, but revenue of $14.46 billion fell short of expectations of $14.55 billion. And while most analysts are generally bullish on the idea of folding HashiCorp into IBM's existing cloud software business, now may or may not be the ideal time to work out such deal. The $6.4 billion offer for HashiCorp is also rather pricey."", ""As for Home Depot stock, don't blame earnings for its poor April performance -- it won't release its fiscal Q1 numbers until mid-May. Blame the macro environment instead. Inflation proved problematic during the home improvement retailer's fiscal Q4 (ended Jan. 28), dragging sales 3% lower on a year-over-year basis. Nothing's significantly changed in the meantime, though. Indeed, if anything, the environment for homebuilding and home improvement has worsened in the shadow of lingering inflation and high interest rates."", ""Finally, Intel stock crashed in April in anticipation of the bad news it dished out with its Q1 results. Although revenue was up 9% year over year, the chipmaker's still facing considerable challenges. Its first-quarter top line of $12.7 billion fell just a bit short of analysts' estimates, while revenue guidance of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion for the quarter now under way was below the $13.6 billion consensus. It's the second consecutive quarter Intel's outlook hasn't been up to snuff, although these back-to-back disappointments may only remind shareholders of deeper-rooted problems for the company."", ""The question remains, though ... should you buy any (or all) of April's worst-performing Dow Jones stocks?"", ""If you're looking for a sweeping, universally applicable answer, then the answer has to be no -- it's not time to buy April's worst-performing Dow stocks."", 'Such an answer, however, oversimplifies the matter.', ""While all pullbacks are potential buying opportunities, not all pullbacks are worth acting on. As I previously noted, sometimes steep sell-offs are a glimpse of what's to come. Other times, sell-offs are happening because something unexpected and insurmountable has taken shape.

The Federal Reserve doesn't intend to cut interest rates until much later this year, and even then, those cuts will likely be modest. This will not only limit demand for new homes, but it will even limit demand for home upgrades. Both are a headwind for Home Depot."", ""And Intel? It's been struggling off and on for years. Its biggest competitive advantage right now is simply its massive capacity to meet the growing need for computer processors and related technology. Even so, rivals are capitalizing on its struggles.

It's a distraction that could last for years."", ""But what about IBM and Boeing? There's a bullish case to be made for both."", ""IBM arguably is overpaying for HashiCorp. However, that premium can be worth it to get an attractive deal done. Given IBM's smashing success with 2019's acquisition of Red Hat, investors should be cautiously optimistic this purchase will pay off too. In the meantime, the technology outfit remains a cash cow, even if it's a slow-moving one. Leveraging its high-margin software business, IBM saw last quarter's operating cash flow rise 10% year over year to $4.2 billion, extending a multiquarter growth trend."", 'Newcomers would also be stepping into IBM stock while the dividend yield stands at a healthy 4%.', ""As for Boeing, yes, the company's a mess. Much of this mess is already reflected in the stock's price, though. Shares are back to where they were shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, and down 33% from their 52-week high. The company has plenty to figure out, but it's finally being forced to do so; a new CEO should help."", ""More than anything, however, the airline industry can't get around the fact it's going to need to purchase on the order of 42,000 new planes over the course of the coming 20 years.

The BofA analysts pointed out that between 1999 and 2019, Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects.', '“They really are an engineering marvel,” they wrote. “Therefore, we have no doubt Embraer could develop an excellent jet to compete in the same class as the 737 Max and the A320neo, on budget, on time and at a fraction of the cost of the other OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).”', 'Morningstar equity analyst Nicolas Owens told Fortune that Embraer is one of a few, if not the only company, that could enter this market.

Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus are building 100 planes between them per month.', '“Embraer has some of the know-how in terms of design and technology, but not the hands-on know-how of what it takes to scale up building an even-larger jet,” Owens told Fortune in an email. “I don’t know where they’d get the startup funds to launch this product that wouldn’t see revenue for almost a decade.""', 'Even the more optimistic analysts at Bank of America argued that Embraer would need to be creative to bring a competing plane to market, possible financing it through risk-sharing partners, direct investment by partners, or some other strategy. It would also have to deal with capital, geopolitical, and market access problems.', 'It was the latter of these issues that made the difference the last time a competitor tried to take a shot at Boeing and Airbus, explained Owens in an April note. After spending more than 10 years and billions of dollars launching an aircraft to compete with the duopoly, Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier was forced to sell its CSeries jet at a steep loss to Airbus after Boeing petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce to hit it with a tariff for selling the plane below production cost. Another example lies in Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi, which last year folded a 16-year effort to develop a regional jet.', 'The newest company to take on Boeing and Airbus, the CCP-backed COMAC, still relies on many U.S.-based parts and has a long while before it can produce them at any sizable quantity, Owens said.', 'While Embraer’s ambitions are high, the reality of bringing a new plane to market may be too much to overcome, Owens wrote in a note for Morningstar.', '“Boeing and Airbus are the only two capable suppliers of globally competitive aircraft larger than 130 seats, and we don’t see any globally competitive new entrants entering the market anytime soon,” he predicted.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The first, in 2019, was hit with software trouble so severe that its empty capsule couldn’t reach the station until the second try in 2022. Then last summer, weak parachutes and flammable tape cropped up that needed to be fixed or removed.', 'Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are retired Navy captains who spent months aboard the space station years ago.

Wilmore, 61, is a former combat pilot from Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and Williams, 58, is a helicopter pilot from Needham, Massachusetts. The duo have been involved in the capsule’s development and insist Starliner is ready for prime time, otherwise they would not strap in for the launch.', '“We’re not putting our heads in the sand,” Williams told The Associated Press. “Sure, Boeing has had its problems. But we are the QA (quality assurance). Our eyes are on the spacecraft.”', 'Starliner will blast off on United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It will be the first time astronauts ride an Atlas since NASA’s Project Mercury, starting with John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Sixty-two years later, this will be the 100th launch of the Atlas V, which is used to hoist satellites as well as spacecraft.', '“We’re super careful with every mission. We’re super, duper, duper careful"" with human missions, said Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.', 'Starliner should reach the space station in roughly 26 hours. The seven station residents will have their eyes peeled on the approaching capsule. The arrival of a new vehicle is ""a really big deal. You leave nothing to chance,” NASA astronaut Michael Barratt told the AP from orbit. Starliner will remain docked for eight days, undergoing checkouts before landing in New Mexico or elsewhere in the American West.', 'Both companies’ capsules are designed to be autonomous and reusable. This Starliner is the same one that made the first test flight in 2019. Unlike the SpaceX Dragons, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches alongside touchscreens and, according to the astronauts, is more like NASA’s Orion capsules for moon missions. Wilmore and Williams briefly will take manual control to wring out the systems on their way to the space station.', ""NASA gave Boeing, a longtime space contractor, more than $4 billion to develop the capsule, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. SpaceX already was in the station delivery business and merely refashioned its cargo capsule for crew. While SpaceX uses the boss' Teslas to get astronauts to the launch pad, Boeing will use a more traditional “astrovan” equipped with a video screen that Wilmore said will be playing “Top Gun: Maverick.”"", 'One big difference at flight’s end: Starliner lands on the ground with cushioning airbags, while Dragon splashes into the sea.', 'Boeing is committed to six Starliner trips for NASA after this one, which will take the company to the station’s planned end in 2030. Boeing’s Nappi is reluctant to discuss other potential customers until this inaugural crew flight is over. But the company has said a fifth seat will be available to private clients.

Mine is to buy companies with long histories of annual dividend increases (think Dividend Kings) when they have historically high yields.

When I bought the stock in 2016 it had decades of annual dividend increases behind it and was struggling to transition its business to a new model. It was fairly ugly for a few years, with the business only recently starting to show material life. The big reason why I was willing to buy it was that IBM has successfully transitioned its business multiple times in the past. Now, it turns out the company has done it again.', ""But check out the graph above. Shortly after I bought the stock it moved sharply higher, which made me feel like a rock star! And then it started heading lower. Warren Buffett, who owned it when I added it to my portfolio, said he made a mistake and sold his stake. I seriously questioned my investment decision, but the story hadn't changed at all so I stuck with it. I basically ended up sitting with a range-bound stock until 2023, when the company overhaul started to show results."", ""Notice in the chart above, however, that despite the uncertainty, IBM's dividend continued to grow. And, perhaps more importantly, the technology giant continued to generate more than enough cash flow to keep paying its dividends."", ""Here's the key to this puzzle: I reinvest my dividends. So for the years I ended up watching IBM do very little for my overall returns, I was adding more shares at what were mostly attractive prices. Indeed, the stock price was often around what I paid initially, and sometimes lower. The yield, which is one of the things that attracted me to IBM in the first place, remained elevated throughout the period. But since nothing changed about the story there was no reason to sell."", ""But those additional purchases added to my return when the company's turnaround efforts started to bear fruit.

But all of them also remain well-run companies and I wouldn't sell them (unless something fundamental and material changed). I'd look at a renewed drop in the stock prices of IBM, P&G, Nucor, and Eaton as a chance to buy more of great companies at increasingly attractive prices."", 'There are plenty of opportunities for investors to buy similar stories today.

You dig deeper and consider the bigger picture."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average's\xa0(DJINDICES: ^DJI) biggest April losers. They may be blue chips, but that doesn't necessarily make them great picks right now."", ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5% last month. That setback doesn't hold a candle to the losses some of its constituents suffered, though. Shares of Boeing (NYSE: BA), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) each fell nearly 13% in April, while technology giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) watched its stock slide over 30%."", 'What went wrong?', ""Aircraft maker Boeing's shares lost altitude all month long. Its first-quarter results released in late April, however, ultimately validated that selling. Revenue fell 8% year over year as continued design and manufacturing problems with its newer 737 and 787 jets crimped demand. The company also booked a heavy loss of $355 million, reminding investors that these headaches aren't mere nuisances -- there's a clear financial cost to them. Then, there's the added disruption of an impending CEO switch. Current chief executive Dave Calhoun will be stepping down at the end of the year, but there's already drama regarding who should replace him."", ""IBM's setback is also mostly earnings-related, although the announcement it will be acquiring cloud software company HashiCorp didn't help. First-quarter earnings of $1.68 per share topped estimates of $1.60, but revenue of $14.46 billion fell short of expectations of $14.55 billion. And while most analysts are generally bullish on the idea of folding HashiCorp into IBM's existing cloud software business, now may or may not be the ideal time to work out such deal. The $6.4 billion offer for HashiCorp is also rather pricey."", ""As for Home Depot stock, don't blame earnings for its poor April performance -- it won't release its fiscal Q1 numbers until mid-May. Blame the macro environment instead. Inflation proved problematic during the home improvement retailer's fiscal Q4 (ended Jan. 28), dragging sales 3% lower on a year-over-year basis. Nothing's significantly changed in the meantime, though. Indeed, if anything, the environment for homebuilding and home improvement has worsened in the shadow of lingering inflation and high interest rates."", ""Finally, Intel stock crashed in April in anticipation of the bad news it dished out with its Q1 results. Although revenue was up 9% year over year, the chipmaker's still facing considerable challenges. Its first-quarter top line of $12.7 billion fell just a bit short of analysts' estimates, while revenue guidance of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion for the quarter now under way was below the $13.6 billion consensus. It's the second consecutive quarter Intel's outlook hasn't been up to snuff, although these back-to-back disappointments may only remind shareholders of deeper-rooted problems for the company."", ""The question remains, though ... should you buy any (or all) of April's worst-performing Dow Jones stocks?"", ""If you're looking for a sweeping, universally applicable answer, then the answer has to be no -- it's not time to buy April's worst-performing Dow stocks."", 'Such an answer, however, oversimplifies the matter.', ""While all pullbacks are potential buying opportunities, not all pullbacks are worth acting on. As I previously noted, sometimes steep sell-offs are a glimpse of what's to come. Other times, sell-offs are happening because something unexpected and insurmountable has taken shape. It's also worth noting that a calendar month isn't a sound basis for determining whether or not a sell-off has run its course. Rebounds can start in the middle of the month, and a stock might slide for two or three (or more) months before finding a bottom."", ""In other words, April's poor performance is only a tiny piece of the much bigger picture you should consider before diving in. With that in mind, Home Depot and Intel aren't worth stepping into following last month's stumbles."", ""Inflation and high interest rates are still clearly with us, and they will likely remain with us for a while. The Federal Reserve doesn't intend to cut interest rates until much later this year, and even then, those cuts will likely be modest. This will not only limit demand for new homes, but it will even limit demand for home upgrades. Both are a headwind for Home Depot."", ""And Intel? It's been struggling off and on for years. Its biggest competitive advantage right now is simply its massive capacity to meet the growing need for computer processors and related technology. Even so, rivals are capitalizing on its struggles. In the meantime, the company may be bogged down by the construction of the factories needed to develop its own foundry business. It's a distraction that could last for years."", ""But what about IBM and Boeing? There's a bullish case to be made for both."", ""IBM arguably is overpaying for HashiCorp. However, that premium can be worth it to get an attractive deal done. Given IBM's smashing success with 2019's acquisition of Red Hat, investors should be cautiously optimistic this purchase will pay off too. In the meantime, the technology outfit remains a cash cow, even if it's a slow-moving one. Leveraging its high-margin software business, IBM saw last quarter's operating cash flow rise 10% year over year to $4.2 billion, extending a multiquarter growth trend."", 'Newcomers would also be stepping into IBM stock while the dividend yield stands at a healthy 4%.', ""As for Boeing, yes, the company's a mess. Much of this mess is already reflected in the stock's price, though. Shares are back to where they were shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020, and down 33% from their 52-week high. The company has plenty to figure out, but it's finally being forced to do so; a new CEO should help."", ""More than anything, however, the airline industry can't get around the fact it's going to need to purchase on the order of 42,000 new planes over the course of the coming 20 years. One way or another, Boeing's going to have to be a big supplier of those passenger jets. Just keep in mind any investment should be a (very) long-term position."", 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

My name is Jordan and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I'm now going to hand over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead."", 'Susan Harcourt: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2024 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation, and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements which are disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer, and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.', 'Andres Gluski: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year, and today I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give more detail on our financial performance and outlook. Beginning on Slide three with our first quarter results. We had a strong first quarter that was in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $863 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $635 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.50. These results demonstrate, once again, our ability to execute on our plans and guidance and our structural resilience to high interest rates and inflation.', ""I am pleased to reaffirm our 2024 guidance for all metrics and growth rates through 2027. Today, I will be discussing the success we have achieved with technology companies and data centers, as well as the significant market opportunity that we see for renewable growth for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide four, I'm happy to announce that this quarter we signed a 15-year contract with Amazon for the second phase of our Bellefield project, with an additional 500 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of storage. The entire project, including Bellefield I, which we contracted last year, will provide 2 gigawatts of combined solar and storage for Amazon, making it the biggest solar plus storage project in the U.S. We see the 2 gigawatt Bellefield solar plus storage project as a milestone for AES and a demonstration of the important role that renewables play in delivering new energy."", ""The significant energy storage component, which includes AES's proprietary AI weather forecasting, ensures the project is able to supply carbon-free energy throughout the day. Turning to Slide five, with this project, we now have nearly 6 gigawatts of long-term contracts directly with technology companies, making AES among the largest energy providers to data centers. This does not include more than 500 megawatts of contracts signed with utilities to serve data center customers. We are fully supporting the commitments that Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others have made to procure not just carbon-free energy, but specifically additional renewables. Turning to Slide six, across the U.S., power demand is forecasted to increase significantly over the next decade, driven by factors such as data center growth, onshoring of manufacturing, and electrification of mobility."", 'There is no technology better suited to serve this load growth than wind and solar, particularly when combined with energy storage. Turning to Slide seven, even using data that is more than a year old, renewables clearly offer the lowest levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, of any new build on an unsubsidized basis. They provide a source of predictable energy that is not impacted by fuel availability or price volatility. Furthermore, renewables are substantially better placed than any other form of power to actually come online over the next decade, when power shortages are likely to be most acute. Nowhere is this clearer than in the interconnection queue, which is, as you can see on Slide eight, are dominated by renewable projects. Looking at 2024 as an example, 95% of the capacity additions in the U.S. are expected to come from solar energy storage, and wind.', 'A major part of this growth is coming from energy storage, whose installed capacity is expected to double by the end of the year. Given our role in creating and first commercializing grid-scale lithium-ion-based energy storage, it fills me with great satisfaction to see that the two largest economies in the country, California and Texas, now get more than 10% of their dispatchable capacity from batteries. We are now even seeing periods of the day in California when energy storage is the single largest source of power on the grid. Turning to Slide nine, among renewable developers, AES is best positioned to address corporate load growth. We have the scale and experience to bring projects to market in the most cost-efficient way. Our flexibility and ability to innovate give us a competitive advantage with our large customers, just as it led to our early partnerships with data center companies.', 'We also have the best track record in the market of supply chain management and bringing projects online, on time, and on budget. As you can see on Slide 10, we have a pipeline of 66 gigawatts, not including prospects, with projects ranging in maturity from early stage to late stage. Let me emphasize that all of the projects in our pipeline include some degree of land control, as well as interconnection filing. In addition, rather than pursuing just total megawatts, we have taken a strategic approach to building our pipeline, focusing on those markets and sites where we see the most significant demand and where we are best positioned to add value. The breadth and maturity of this pipeline, both in terms of market and interconnection queue positions, provides us with a meaningful competitive advantage and line of sight into future growth.', 'As I mentioned in February, our historical results, combined with accelerating demand for our renewable projects, led us to increase our U.S. project return expectations by 200 basis points, to 12% to 15%, on a levered, after-tax cash basis, and raise our long-term guidance for both EBITDA and EPS. With 1.2 gigawatts of new contract signings since our Q4 call in February, including Bellefield II, we now have a backlog of signed contracts of 12.7 gigawatts. We have also added almost 600 megawatts of new projects to our operating portfolio, including the completion of Chevelon Butte, which is the largest wind project in the state of Arizona and Delta, which is the first utility scale win project in the state of Mississippi. With these additions to our operating fleet and the good progress we are making on our projects currently under construction, we remain fully on track to add a total of 3.6 gigawatts of new capacity this year.', ""I should note that for the remaining projects coming online in 2024, we have 92% of the major equipment already on site, including virtually all of our solar modules and more than half of our solar modules for 2025. Our diversified and resilient supply chain has been and will continue to be one of our differentiators. Turning to our utilities on Slide 11, in mid-April, AES Indiana achieved a critical milestone with the approval of its rate case by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Resolving the rate case provides us a constructive regulatory foundation for our investments focused on reliability, resiliency, and customer experience, and allows us to partially recover accumulated inflation since our last rate case in 2017. The $71 million rate case increase includes an ROE of 9.9%, demonstrating the Commission's support for investments that strengthen the overall system reliability and drive value for customers."", ""In late February, we also closed on the acquisition of the 106-megawatt Hoosier wind project, providing long-term savings to our customers while also adding to AES Indiana's portfolio of renewable projects. AES Indiana's latest integrated resource plan, or IRP, includes a commitment for the addition of 1,300 megawatts of wind, solar, and energy storage over the next five years. At AES Ohio, we continue to execute on our growth plan, stemming from our new rate case structure, ESP-4, put in place in Q3 of last year, as well as our smart grid program and FERC formula investment in transmission. By the end of the program, AES Ohio will still maintain the lowest rates in the state across all customer classes. As a reminder, approximately 80% of AES Ohio's planned investments through 2027 are already approved or under FERC formula rate programs."", 'Across our two utilities, our Q1 investment was up nearly 100% from last year, as a result of the new rate structures and investing to improve system resilience and customer experience. Looking ahead, we now have a clear line of sight to $4 billion of our total utility capital program of $5.3 billion through 2027. We are also seeing the potential for further upside from the growing interest from data center providers who see our service territory as a desirable location for growth. With double-digit rate-based growth throughout our planned horizon, we believe they represent one of the fastest-growing utility investment opportunities in the country. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.', 'Steve Coughlin: Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Following that, I will provide a deeper dive into our low-risk, highly-efficient capital structure, which is important for everyone to understand. Turning to Slide 13, adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $863 million in the first quarter versus $641 million a year ago. This was driven primarily by contributions from the roughly 600 megawatts of new renewables we brought online. Turning to Slide 14, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 versus $0.22 last year and in line with our expectations. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but also included higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate.', ""These results include approximately $0.08 of tax benefits consistent with our expectations, which were associated with steps we took this quarter to transition to a more U.S.-oriented holding company structure that is better aligned with our significant U.S. growth. In the future, we may recognize further benefits from our revised simpler structure, although likely of a smaller magnitude. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 23% to 25% for the full year, excluding the impact of tax credit transfers, which we are showing at the SBU level for simplicity. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or strategic business units on the next four slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 15, higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses but was partially offset by lower renewable resource in Panama and Brazil."", 'Higher adjusted TTC at our utilities SBU was mostly driven by favorable weather in the U.S., as well as higher revenues from investments in our rate base. This was partially offset by interest expense on new borrowings to fund future growth. Relatively flat EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects prior year higher LNG transaction margins and the sell down of our gas and LNG businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic. This was partially offset by higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run plant. Finally, higher EBITDA at our new energy technologies SBU reflects continued margin improvement at Fluence. Now turning to our guidance on Slide 19. We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion and 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion.', 'We expect to continue to see strong growth in our renewables and utilities businesses partially offset by short-term dilution from continued execution on our $3.5 billion asset sale target through 2027. We are also reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.87 to $1.97. Our earnings will have similar drivers to adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but will also be impacted by a lower adjusted tax rate and higher parent interest. We anticipate a more even distribution of cash and earnings throughout the year with nearly half of earnings expected to come in the first half versus only 25% in 2023. Now to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 20. Sources reflect approximately $3 billion of total discretionary cash including $1.1 billion of parent-free cash flow, $900 million to $1.1 billion of proceeds from asset sales, and $900 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance.', 'As a reminder, we limit any parent debt issuance to a level consistent with our investment grade credit metrics. We continue to be very pleased with the great progress toward our $3.5 billion asset sale program, which will limit and may eliminate any need for future parent equity issuance throughout our long-term guidance period. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion toward new growth, of which 85% will go to renewables and utilities. One of our strengths is the flexibility we maintain in our capital plan across both sources and uses. As we have for many years, we will continue to execute on opportunities to rotate capital across the portfolio in a manner that creates shareholder value.', ""Next, I want to take a moment to discuss how we manage our balance sheet on Slide 21. First, we utilize non-recourse debt to fund our growth. Approximately 82% of the debt on our balance sheet is non-recourse to AES Corp., meaning it is only secured at the relevant subsidiary level. This important structural component limits our risk at the parent company to the equity we invest in our subsidiaries. We further insulate our financials from interest rate movements, with nearly 90% of our long-term debt being fixed rate or hedged. In addition, nearly $4 billion of the debt on our balance sheet is under designated construction facilities, which are also non-recourse to the parent company, but are backed by projects that don't yet generate earnings or cash."", ""When a project reaches commercial operations, approximately half of this construction debt will be repaid with cash generated from the monetization of tax attributes, leading to a significantly lower long-term leverage profile on projects in operation. As a result, recourse debt to the AES parent is only 18% of total leverage. Using an example of a typical U.S. solar plus battery project on Slide 22, we've centered our strategy around a capital-efficient model which quickly recycles cash, enabling the rapid growth we've achieved in recent years. First, when we place a project in service, we pay down at least 40% of a project's capital cost with tax equity partnerships and tax credit transfers. Our projects typically benefit from the investment tax credit, which provides an attractive upfront cash return on our investment and significantly reduces net parent cash requirements."", 'We fund an additional approximately 40% using fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse debt, which is investment-grade rated. In order to insulate project returns from changes in interest rates, we pre-hedge this expected debt issuance when we sign a PPA. We currently have nearly $9 billion of outstanding interest rate hedges on our balance sheet, most of which relate to our U.S. renewables business. With respect to equity requirements for U.S. renewables, our development partner, Alberta Investment Management, or AIMCO, contributes 25% of equity capital needs. Once a project is completed, we typically bundle it into an operating portfolio and sell down a large minority stake at an attractive premium and recover most, if not all, of the upfront parent equity investment in the project.', ""The end result is a material ownership in a high-quality, long-term renewables project with little net cash invested and de minimis risk to our balance sheet. This model allows us to grow rapidly while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and ensures our financial results are not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Now, turning back to our first quarter results, we've had a tremendous start to the year, making significant progress toward all of our financial targets. We expect to continue the momentum in the year to go as we complete our remaining 3 gigawatts of new projects and continue growing the rate base at our U.S. utilities while maintaining a low-risk, highly efficient capital structure and funding plan. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."", 'Andres Gluski: Thank you, Steve. Before we open up the call for questions, I would like to sum up the highlights of the quarter. We had a strong first quarter, in line with our expectations. Our earnings and cash flow are now more evenly balanced throughout the year as our U.S. renewable business matures. Our performance demonstrates, yet again, our ability to execute and that our financial results are not sensitive to higher interest rates. Our financial model is proving very resilient as we see ample supply of non-recourse project finance debt, as well as strong demand for tax attributes and project equity from minority partners. In addition, our asset sales program is on track, representing an important component of our capital-efficient growth model, which may even eliminate our need for issuing corporate equity through our long-term guidance period.', ""Our stock would have to reach much higher valuation before new parent equity would even be considered several years in the future. We see strong and accelerating demand for renewables in our core markets and are pleased to be in a leading position with the largest segment of growth data centers. We're also executing well on our construction program and have virtually all of the major equipment we need for 2024 on site and the majority of what we need for 2025 as well. Our supply chain management continues to support our best-in-class track record of delivering new renewable projects on time and on budget. In closing, we are once again delivering on our strategic objectives and financial guidance and are uniquely well-placed to be one of the winners of the energy transition."", 'Operator, please open up the line for questions.', 'Operator: Thank you.

Major automakers recently signed up to use its NACS (North American Charging Standard) plug.', 'Nearly 500 workers were let go from the group, including senior director Rebecca Tinucci. CEO Elon Musk made the move last week, according to Bloomberg and other sources, and it comes after Musk spearheaded a headcount reduction that totaled over 10% earlier this month. Tesla’s former head of strategic charging programs confirmed the layoffs on X as well.', 'The growth of Tesla’s Supercharger network, totaling 6,249 Supercharger stations and more than 57,000 connectors, will now reportedly slow and construction at certain locations will cease.', 'Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.', 'Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations', '— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 30, 2024', 'What this means for the future of Tesla’s Supercharger network, and the larger EV build-out across the US, is unknown and throws a lot of planning in doubt.', 'President Joe Biden has put tremendous political capital into the EV transformation of the US fleet of cars on the road, including a $7.5 billion build-out of the nation’s EV charging infrastructure. Through the use of public and private funding, the White House targets 500,000 new chargers by the end of the decade via the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.', 'Tesla is one of the bigger White House partners in the NEVI initiative.', '""Tesla has already been awarded money under the federal government\'s NEVI program; there\'s no way Mr. Musk would walk away from effectively free money,” said CEO Andres Pinter of Bullet EV Charging, one of Tesla’s Supercharger contractors, to Reuters. Pinter said Tesla’s decision to pause its Supercharger buildout was a “kick in the pants” to his business, leaving current Tesla projects in limbo.', 'Pinter believes that the administration’s “free money” will likely mean Musk reconstituting the charging business, as opposed to abandoning it. And Tesla’s automaker charging partners hope that is the case.', 'Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others have signed up to access the Supercharger network, and will incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.', '“We have nothing new to announce regarding our plans to transition to NACS [also known as the SAE J3400 standard],” GM said in a statement to Yahoo Finance concerning Tesla’s latest move. “We are continuing to monitor the situation regarding changes to the Supercharger team and the potential impacts.”', 'Ford, which earlier this year received access to the Supercharger via the use of a Tesla-made adapter, said its “plans for our customers do not change” at the moment. Rivian, which also gained access to the Supercharger network this year, told Yahoo Finance that its “owners continue to have access to the Tesla Supercharger Network, and we have begun shipping NACS DC adapters to our customers.”', 'Most of the automakers who responded to Yahoo Finance echoed one another, with Kia also stating that its plans haven’t changed and it will build toward NACS compatibility.', 'The news clearly blindsided Tesla’s automaker partners, with one source at a major automaker telling Yahoo Finance the move by Tesla was “crazy.”', '“Laying off the Supercharger team is going to slow access to the network for [original equipment manufacturers] … and slow the pace of infrastructure deployment,” said K.C.

While the charging business was expected to grow in upcoming years, the business is still a “fairly insignificant” part of Tesla’s small services division that barely makes any money, relatively speaking.', '“Musk’s decision to reduce costs in a non-core area with ongoing high CapEx requirements and little visibility towards attractive profit margins should be seen as understandable, even if perhaps not communicated in the best way,” Ramsay wrote.', 'BNEF saw Tesla (prior to the move to axe the Supercharger team) pulling in $7.4 billion in revenue globally in its charging business by 2030. Tesla pulled in nearly $100 billion in revenue in 2023 alone.', 'The charging business should be able to stand up on its own, Ramsay believes, and then it may be worth something, eventually.', '“But our view is that charging evolving from [a] tool to help Tesla growth to something judged much more on its prospects as a business opportunity — which could well progress further to a decision around a potential sell-off of the division to a more natural owner — could be overall positive.”', 'Tesla’s move to curtail the growth of the Supercharger network also opens up pathways for other companies to step in.', '“EVgo is actively engaged in the development of the J3400 standard as a voting member and we look forward to welcoming more Tesla drivers to our network as we add NACS to our nationwide fast charging network,” said Sara Rafalson, EVgo’s senior vice president of market development and public policy, to Yahoo Finance.', 'While EVgo is one of the bigger players in the industry, others believe a new player could emerge and take on what Tesla started.', '“This unexpected move by Tesla is not indicative of a broader trend or fundamental issue with the EV charging business model. Instead, it points to an open opportunity in the industry,” said Patrick Sullivan, CEO of commercial charging firm EV Realty.', 'Sullivan believes this is a moment for others to step up and lead “version 2.0” of the charging industry, as it moves toward open standards and interoperability. Those 500 or so laid off from Tesla have valuable expertise, he said.', '“Tesla alumni are already everywhere, including on our own team, where they have been instrumental in helping us build low-cost, high-utilization EV charging solutions for our fleet customers,” Sullivan said. “I have no doubt that we will see the force multiplier of this talented group of professionals once they find new roles at companies in this space.”', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:ATMU) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 3, 2024', 'Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Atmus Filtration Technologies' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Chirillo, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", ""Todd Chirillo : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Atmus Filtration Technologies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Steph Disher, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Kienzler, Chief Financial Officer. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results. Please refer to our slides on our website for the disclosure of the risks that could affect our results and for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures referred to on our call. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations pages available on our website at Atmus.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Steph."", 'Steph Disher: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong performance in the first quarter. On the call today, I’ll provide an update on our performance in the quarter. Our outlook for the year and provide some comments on delivery of our growth strategy. Jack will then provide additional details regarding our financial performance. Before I discuss the quarterly performance, I’d like to acknowledge the significant milestone of Atmus becoming a fully independent company on March 18. On February 14, Cummins announced an exchange offer, whereby Cummins shareholders could exchange all or a portion of Cummins common stock for shares of Atmus. Investors showed significant interest in the offer with the transaction approximately 12 times oversubscribed.', ""The divestiture of Atmus shares by Cummins was completed on March 18 and resulted in the full separation of Atmus. With the successful completion of the exchange offer, all former Cummins appointed Directors have resigned from the Atmus Board of Directors and two new independent directors, Diego Donoso, and Stuart Taylor have been appointed to the Board. A majority of the Atmus Board of Directors is now independent, and I'm excited to be working with the Board, as we continue to accelerate growth and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Now let's turn to the first quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2024. We delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter. Sales were $427 million compared to $419 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 2%."", 'Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $80 million or 18.8% compared to $79 million or 18.8% in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes $6 million of one-time stand-alone costs and $4 million for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 in the first quarter of 2024 and adjusted free cash flow was negative $13 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes $6 million of one-time separation-related items. Now let me provide some insight into our global market. As expected, we saw softer freight activity during the first quarter. However, our continued market share gains are offsetting some of the market weakness. Demand in the first-fit markets has started to show signs of slowness in the US, in India markets remain robust, while in China, the market continues to fall short of expectations.', 'Looking ahead to our outlook for global markets, I will start with aftermarket for both on-highway and off-highway. In North America, we saw the cash freight index down 5% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. The rate of decline slowed through the quarter with the month of March down 3.6% year-over-year. While we are expecting year-over-year freight activity to gradually improve through the balance of the year, we are still experiencing year-over-year declines and have not yet seen positive freight activity compared to the prior period. In global off-highway markets, we continue to see strength in North American construction for both residential and non-residential construction, partially aided by government infrastructure spending.', 'Economic conditions in Europe continue to be depressed with weakness in construction activity. And in the Asia Pacific region, we are seeing low utilization rates across a number of our key end-markets. Overall, we expect aftermarket for on-highway and off-highway to be flat to up 2% during the year, down slightly from our previous guidance of flat to up 3%. Let us turn to our first-fit markets. In the US, we are anticipating declines to primarily impact the second half of 2024. We are modestly raising our outlook for U.S. heavy-duty truck to be down 7% to 12% for the full-year. From our previous guidance of down 10% to 15%. In medium-duty truck, our outlook remains unchanged at flat to down 5%. In China, we expect weakness to persist and demand for trucks in India is expected to remain robust, driven by strong on-highway performance.', 'While the outlook for our markets is mixed, we continue to execute on our growth plans and expand our market share in both aftermarket and first-fit. Our revenue guidance is unchanged at down 1% to up 3%, with global sales in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.675 billion. We expect continued strong operational performance and to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.25% to 19.25%, unchanged from prior guidance. Additionally, adjusted EPS is unchanged from our prior outlook and anticipated to be in a range of $2.10 to $2.35. As we have separated from Cummins, we have incurred separation costs and cash impacts associated with establishing a stand-alone company. These costs and cash flows are onetime in nature. We want to be transparent and highlight those items to enable a clear understanding of the ongoing performance and cash generation of our business.', 'In relation to cash flow outlook, I want to highlight a onetime cash outflow, which is estimated to be $30 million in 2024. This impact arises as a result of a change in working capital. Cummins previously processed our payroll on our behalf, and we received 60 day terms. As we transition to managing our own payroll directly, this cash will flow innately upon payment to employees. Now I would like to take a moment to share the progress we have made on implementing our growth strategy. As a reminder, there are four pillars of our growth strategy. Our first pillar is to grow share in first step. We are a leader in Fuel Filtration and Crankcase Ventilation products, and we are focused on growing this leadership position with global OEM customers.', 'We are winning with the winners and have continued to secure Cummins new vehicle platforms, we are also accelerating growth with other leading global OEMs. We have recently won the fuel filtration business of a global OEM for their European and North American business, and we are actively pursuing new customers who were out of reach to us as part of Cummins. Our second and third pillar are interrelated and focus on accelerating profitable growth in the aftermarket and transforming our supply chain. We are relentlessly focused on our customers and providing the right product when and where it is needed. Our agility allows us to continue gaining share in the aftermarket with our world-class Fleetguard products. As a key component of our agility is the continued transformation of our global distribution capabilities to provide our customers with industry-leading product availability.', 'Earlier this year, we inaugurated our southern distribution center near Dallas, Texas, and we recently opened our newest distribution facility in Singapore. We now have coverage for over 80% of our volume being distributed through dedicated Atmus warehouse facilities. We are on track to establish additional centers in Europe throughout 2024. We are also focused on driving efficiencies through our purchasing organization and investing in automation in our manufacturing operations. These focus areas will support continued reduction of our operating costs. We have demonstrated delivery of our transformation initiatives through expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin 300 basis points during 2023. Our guidance for 2024 reflects continued momentum, as we execute on our strategy.', 'Our fourth pillar is to expand into industrial filtration markets. We intend to pursue this growth inorganically, and we see a strong pipeline of opportunities, which our team is continuously evaluating. We will take a disciplined programmatic approach with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities will continue to reflect our focus on growing our business, both organically and inorganically. We are also assessing our approach to returning cash to shareholders now that we are an independent company. I am proud of our Atmus team, who delivered another strong quarter of performance. As a fully independent company, we will accelerate our growth strategy as we move through 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Jack, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.', 'Jack Kienzler: Thank you, Steph, and good morning everyone. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in the first quarter. Sales were $427 million compared to $419 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 2%. The increase in sales was primarily driven by pricing of approximately 2% and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by a modest decrease in volume as market share gains continued to counterbalance challenging conditions across many of our markets. Gross margin for the first quarter was $112 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. In addition to pricing, we also benefited from lower commodities which more than offset the impact of higher freight and manufacturing costs, along with lower volumes.', 'Selling, administrative and research expenses for the first quarter were $53 million, an increase of $5 million over the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher people-related and consulting costs, as we continue to stand up our team and separate our functions from Cummins. Joint venture income was $10 million in the first quarter, an increase of $2 million from 2023, primarily due to strong performance at our joint venture in India. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of $80 million or 18.8% compared to $79 million or 18.8% in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes $6 million of one-time stand-alone costs and excludes $4 million for the same period last year. We believe these costs will be in a range of $10 million to $20 million in 2024, an increase from our prior guidance of $5 million to $15 million.', 'These one-time costs primarily related to the establishment of functions previously co-mingled with Cummins, such as information technologies, distribution centers and human resources. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.67 last year. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO in May of 2023. Adjusted free cash flow was negative $13 million this quarter compared to $37 million in the prior year. The higher cash usage was primarily related to increased working capital requirements and the payment of incentive compensation for strong performance achieved in 2023. Free cash flow has been adjusted at $3 million for capital expenditures related to our separation from Cummins compared to $1 million in the previous year.', 'As Steph mentioned earlier in the call, we are also adjusting free cash flow for working capital inefficiencies associated with the move from intercompany settlement terms with Cummins to stand-alone practices. In the first quarter, this adjustment is $3 million and relates to Cummins processing payroll on our behalf prior to the full separation and we reimburse them on 60-day terms consistent with historical practices. As we take over the payroll process, these cash obligations are funded as incurred. We expect these inefficiencies to impact us through the end of the third quarter of this year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 22% compared to 23.7% in 2023. The decrease was driven by a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign operations.', 'Now let us turn to the continued strength of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $149 million of cash on hand, combined with the full availability of our $400 million revolving credit facility, we have $549 million of available liquidity. Our cash position and continued strong performance during the first quarter of 2024 has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our balance sheet provides us with operational flexibility as we focus on value creation, and delivering total shareholder value by deploying capital for continued organic growth and strategic inorganic initiatives. In closing, I want to thank our global team for their hard work and dedication as we begin our first year as a fully independent company.', 'I am looking forward to continuing our momentum and delivering on our strategy throughout the year. Now we will take your questions.', 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead. And the second question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria, JPMorgan.

There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...'

This reduction in EPS is less than the 5% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.', 'It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Exelon the TSR over the last 5 years was 26%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""Exelon shareholders are down 9.4% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 26%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

Here\'s why the outlook appears positive for this oil and gas producer.', 'The bulk of Devon\'s production comes from the Delaware Basin in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Management\'s decision to focus investment there appears to be paying off, as first-quarter production came in better than expected. The plan is to invest in improving well productivity in its highest-quality assets, and the good news is Devon achieved ""better-than-planned well productivity, cycle time improvements that brought forward activity and the easing of infrastructure constraints in the Delaware Basin,"" according to the earnings release.', 'First-quarter production averaged 664 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) compared to guidance for 630 MBoe/d to 650 MBoe/d.', 'In addition, management raised its full-year production guidance to 655 MBoe/d to 675 MBoe/d, compared to a previous estimate of 640 MBoe/d to 660 MBoe/d.', 'Devon is increasing production at the right time, as the price of oil has stayed relatively high through 2024, enabling the company to generate $623 million in adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter. Management has a policy of distributing 70% of its adjusted FCF to shareholders, meaning a payout of roughly $430 million this quarter. Of that amount, $142 million went toward a fixed dividend payment of $0.22 per share. Most of the rest went to share repurchases ($205 million), with only $82 million allocated toward a variable dividend of $0.13 per share.', ""That may disappoint some income-seeking investors, but it shouldn't.

However, despite this, both economic growth and the labor market have displayed resilience. Recent economic indicators have prompted Morgan Stanley Research to revise its forecast for U.S. economic growth, now projecting 2.3% for 2024 and 2.1% for 2025, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Consequently, the Fed is expected to initiate the first rate cut of this cycle in July, instead of the previously anticipated June, followed by two more 25 basis point cuts by year-end. Looking ahead to 2025, Morgan Stanley anticipates a continued downward trend in rates, with the Fed making cuts at each meeting through June, aiming to reach a rate of 3.625%.', 'The first quarter of 2024 marked Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick\'s inaugural term, with his background in investment banking and trading standing in contrast to his predecessor James Gorman\'s focus on wealth management. Pick\'s tenure began on a challenging note, with the bank facing headwinds from high-interest rates prompting wealth management clients to shift funds into higher-yielding securities. By April 16, the bank\'s shares had declined by nearly 7% for the year. However, similar to its competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley benefitted from robust trading and investment banking performance in Q1. Pick, emphasizing the vital role of dealmaking as an ""existential reality"" for companies, signaled a potential catalyst for Wall Street\'s awaited recovery in investment banking.

Wealth management revenue rose by 4.9% to $6.88 billion, surpassing estimates by $230 million, driven by market gains boosting fee revenue despite a decrease in interest income. At the same time, fixed-income trading revenue dipped by 3.5% to $2.49 billion but still beat expectations by $120 million. Investment banking revenue surged by 16% to $1.45 billion, slightly surpassing the $1.40 billion estimate, driven by higher debt and equity issuance, offsetting lower acquisition fees."", ""Speaking more on its outlook for the future, this is what the bank's management had to say during the first quarter 2024 earnings call:"", 'Looking ahead to the second quarter, the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of NII.

These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk.

On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector and its outlook for this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Financial Sector Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', '2023 didn’t start out very rosy for the financial sector, marked by the sudden collapses of notable regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank. These downfalls were specifically concerning because of their widespread impacts, affecting various geographical regions. Bank shares remained under pressure throughout 2023, but they experienced a notable surge toward the end of October. This was fueled by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve would conclude its campaign of raising interest rates without causing a recession. Financials ended up finishing the year with positive returns, with the S&P 500 Financials delivering a 12.15% return to shareholders.', 'That said, since high-interest rates are still at play, the financial sector is not completely out of the dangers it suffered from in the spring of 2023. As CNBC reported, the Federal Reserve hasn’t started lowering its main interest rate, because of which banks still have massive amounts of unrealized losses from bonds and loans with low-interest rates on their financial records. This, along with possible losses from commercial real estate, puts large parts of the banking sector at risk. The report further mentioned that over 280 US banks, collectively holding nearly $900 billion in assets, face potential capital needs due to high levels of exposure to commercial real estate and losses related to interest rates.', 'Many financial analysts anticipate rate cuts in 2024 that could mainly influence the performance of bank stocks. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo discussed the outlooked with Bloomberg and said:', '“There are a number of factors that can impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior, to name just a few. All of which we have little to no control over.”', 'As a result of this, some of the biggest banks such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) have been crystal ball gazing and predicting declines in their net interest income(NII) for 2024. On the other hand, we saw how high-interest rates last year were beneficial for the biggest banks as they managed to amass $253 billion in NII, marking an increase of approximately $80 billion compared to the total in 2021. S&P Global also expects NII to decline in 2024, however, the firm also anticipates that banks will achieve a return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11% and will build their capital reserves by retaining earnings.', 'Financial companies are also known for paying dividends to shareholders. In fact, if we look at the recent data, we get to know that nearly half of the global increases in dividend payouts in 2023 originated from banks, exceeding their share in the total dividend payments, which is one-sixth, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report also mentioned that the significant 15% rise, reaching a record $220 billion, primarily came from banks’ improved profitability due to the normalization of interest rates following years of loose monetary policies. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the financial sector.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from the finance sector. These companies offer a wide range of financial services, including banking, insurance, investment management, and financial planning. From the resultant list, we picked 14 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', ""In addition to covering topics like the best dividend stocks to buy, at Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea.

Both companies have two key traits that dividend investors crave: Predictability and high yields.', 'Coca-Cola and Pepsi are two of the most predictable dividend payers on the market. Both companies have paid and increased their dividends for more than 50 years (61 years and 51 years, respectively), earning them the prestigious title Dividend King.', 'Coca-Cola and Pepsi are also both considered to have high-yield dividends -- a yield is how much investors get back compared to the value of the investment. The yield for Coca-Cola is over 3%, whereas the yield for Pepsi is just below that. But as the chart below shows, the yield for both companies is more than double the average for the S&P 500.', ""However, if there's a knock against Coca-Cola and Pepsi as dividend investments, it's in their ability to grow their dividends."", ""In February, Coca-Cola announced that it was raising its dividend by about 5%. For its part, Pepsi's latest raise (also announced in February) was better at 10%. Therefore, they are growing dividends, but it's fair to wonder if raises in future years will be as big as these."", ""Many investors look at a company's cash flow and compare it to dividend payments to get a sense of how much a dividend can grow over time. In Coca-Cola's case, this year it expects full-year free cash flow of $9.2 billion, down slightly from 2023. But it paid $8 billion in dividends in 2023 and just raised its dividend by 5%. Therefore, future raises could be small because its dividend is eating up a lot of its current cash flow."", ""Pepsi is in a similar situation. It doesn't talk about free cash flow in its earnings reports. But looking at traditional profitability metrics shows a comparable situation. In 2024, the company expects to pay dividends of $5.06 per share. In comparison, it expects $8.15 in earnings per share (EPS) this year. Therefore, it expects to pay out 62% of its earnings as dividends this year, which leaves some room for future raises. But dividend increases likely won't outpace EPS growth."", ""Dividend growth is important for investors with longer time horizons. That's why dividend investors might want to give the third biggest beverage company, Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP), a look today."", 'With its dividend yield of 2.6%, many dividend investors will look past Keurig Dr Pepper stock and buy shares of Coca-Cola or Pepsi instead, given the higher yields. However, Keurig Dr Pepper has increased its dividend at a faster rate over the last five years, and I believe it can do it again.', 'Keurig Dr Pepper just reported financial results, and its profits are finally surging after years of disappointing progress.', ""Over the last five years, Keurig Dr Pepper's gross profit growth has outpaced revenue growth, which is a good thing to see. The company's operating profit growth is outpacing progress with its gross profit, which is even better. While this is a five-year trend, the trend since the beginning of 2023 is more pronounced."", ""Keurig Dr Pepper's management credits its improvements to just good old-fashioned operational discipline. What I like about this kind of improvement is that it's not driven by external factors, which are unpredictable and perhaps not repeatable. The company can sustain its success and even further build on it."", ""As it is, Keurig Dr Pepper has a dividend payout ratio of just 54%, according to YCharts. That's far lower than the payout ratios for Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which are both at 74%. This metric alone suggests that Keurig Dr Pepper has more room to grow its dividend at a faster pace than the other two. And if the company keeps growing its earnings at a faster pace, then it will have even more room."", ""Keurig Dr Pepper won't necessarily be the top-performing stock on the market year in and year out -- it's a mature business and growth is modest. But from a dividend perspective, I believe Keurig Dr Pepper can supply investors with consistency, a generous yield, and above-average dividend growth for the next several years and beyond."", 'Before you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn’t one of them.

Results were good overall, with revenues beating analyst predictions by 2.4% to hit US$11b. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in at US$0.74, some 8.5% above whatthe analysts had expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""Taking into account the latest results, Coca-Cola's 19 analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$45.7b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 10% to US$2.76. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$45.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.74 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$66.96. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Coca-Cola, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$74.00 and the most bearish at US$60.00 per share. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Coca-Cola is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 1.1% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 6.5% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 5.0% per year. It's pretty clear that Coca-Cola's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Coca-Cola's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$66.96, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Coca-Cola. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente."", ""Vicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew. Good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication, and continuing to think and act like owners, helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. Starting on slide three, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another solid start to the year, demonstrating the continuous strength of our execution engine, IRX. We remain nimble, and we're prepared to pivot if market conditions were to change. Based on our solid Q1 performance, we are raising our 2024 full-year guidance. Turning to slide four, our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day target outlined on this page."", ""IRX is our competitive differentiator, and combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth in 2024. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On slide five, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight two recently closed transactions. Let me walk you through these two deals that are adjacent to our core. In other words, both companies' products can be used by attaching them to our existing compressor or pump technologies. First, Ethafilter, which expands our technology by extending our reach into highly attractive end-markets with the additional of Sterile Filtration Technology. Next is Controlled Fluidics, which expands our technology with specialization in thermoplastics, high-performance plastic bonding, and custom plastic assembly products for life sciences, aerospace, and industrial applications."", 'And finally, on the right-hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that with the announced acquisition of ILC Dover, which is expected to close later this quarter, we have already exceeded our analyzed inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points. Having said that, we continue to execute our bolt-on M&A strategy and expect more deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our analyzed inorganic revenue target. Turning to slide six, I want to provide some additional information on the acquisition of ILC Dover with an overview of the portfolio. This slide details the breakdown of the business by end market, as well as the long-term CAGR for each portion of the business, core competencies, and future growth creation opportunities.', 'Approximately 75% of the total business falls into life sciences end market, which can be split roughly 60/40 between key markets of biopharma and Medical Components, CDMO. We expect this portion of the business to grow in the high single-digit plus range over the long-term. Let me dive a bit deeper, starting with biopharma, in which the core competencies are in powder and liquid handling, where we see future growth opportunities for pull-through on pumps and compressors, as well as the new customer and direct channel access to these customers. Some of the most exciting growth drivers in the biopharma market, where ILC Dover has great presence, is in supplying single-use and containment technologies in support of the manufacturing of fast-growing monoclonal antibodies and antibody derivatives in therapeutics to treat cancer and rare diseases.', 'ILC Dover also plays a crucial role in the growing markets for novel diabetes and obesity therapies. And the increasing demand for flexible, next-generation cell culture facilities to serve the cell and gene therapy market. The primary benefits for the single-use equipment produced by ILC Dover are a lower cross-contamination risk, reduced cleaning and sterilization efforts, a highly flexible manufacturing process, much shorter batch turnaround times, and reduced plant footprint and capital investment, respectively, all of which play an important role in the customer, ROI, which is core to how we at Ingersoll Rand support our customers with our current products and solutions. Moving on to the Medical Components, CDMO portion of the business, where the core competency is extrusion and molding of complex, custom silicone and thermoplastic components, as well as sub-assemblies.', ""This business gives us access to a wide range of new customers on the medical technology side, focusing high-growth segments like cardiovascular and neurology. In addition, we see a lot of future growth opportunities to leverage this niche technology for the creation of high-consumable items like tubing for the biopharma business, as well as pull-through on pumps and compression systems in the sub-assemblies they produce today. Moving on to the Aerospace & Defense end market, which accounts for approximately 25% of the total business, although small in nature, we're very excited to have this business within our portfolio for multiple reasons. First, this is a very solid business in terms of growth and profitability. Second, it has given us a great point of entry into the global space market, which is estimated to be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035, nearly tripling from $630 billion in 2023."", ""As described on the slide, the majority of the volume is comprised of human mobility and habitation. Over the long term, in this end market, we anticipate a mid-single to high-single digit growth rate. With core competencies of space suits, inflatable habitats, lighter than air vehicles, and other inflatables, we believe that there is an opportunity for pull-through on our core technologies and a future growth opportunity. For example, oxygen generation is needed across all these products, and we're currently a market leader in compression technology for portable oxygen concentrators. This is just one example to provide some additional perspective on how we see the pull-through of our technologies where today we're not present. As we move to slide seven, let me spend some time talking about the alignment of ILC Dover against our stated strategic importance for M&A."", 'First, we start with an example of Adjacent Technology. Within the life science end market, we have always targeted the consumable portion of bioprocessing, which focuses on single-use technology, including powder containment, liquid management, tubing and components, isolator protectors, and many others. With ILC Dover, we get exactly that, a very clear adjacent market in which we can combine our pumps to those consumables and offer a more complete product portfolio to our customers. An example of this is combining our peristaltic pump technology with a newly launched ILC Dover tubing technology to deliver liquids to single-use devices, which are also made by ILC Dover. This is merely one example of how we can help support customers across multiple steps within their biopharma workflow.', ""Moving into the Aligned category, first, we're getting mission-critical equipment like flexible isolators for biopharma manufacturing. Isolators made by ILC Dover are best in class, single-use, and an essential step in the manufacturing process of therapies requiring high-potency APIs, one of which is Antibody-Drug Conjugates, or ADCs, which is a fast-growing class of biopharmaceutical drugs designed to target and treat cancer. Second, the Medical Components, CDMO business enables us to enter a highly fragmented, high-growth segment of MedTech and biomanufacturing. As mentioned on the previous slide, we believe that there's a significant opportunity for pull-through on our existing pumps and compression technology and also access to new customers and a direct channel of communication with them."", ""Finally, ILC Dover is giving us the optionality to access the fast-growing market of Aerospace & Defense. With ILC Dover's deep relationship with NASA, Boeing, and ZeroSpace, to just name a few, we believe that we can leverage these relationships for pull-through opportunities on many of Ingersoll Rand existing flow creation technologies. The acquisition of ILC Dover now provides us a larger platform to continue to build our life sciences business through both an M&A and optionality with a fast-growing market of Aerospace & Defense. Moving to slide eight, let me touch base on our organic initiative. Total organic orders in the first quarter were down 7% due primarily to large project order timing. As we have discussed before, large, long-cycle projects usually driven by mega-project investment tend to be lumpy in nature, and this can create a dynamic of tough comparison in a single quarter."", ""We believe that we're getting an outside share of these projects, and we continue to be focused on book-to-bill. In Q1, as expected, we saw book-to-bill greater than one, build in backlog which was up 2% year-over-year. Moving to the chart on the left side of the page, we're encouraged by both the organic order acceleration through Q1 and the increased Marketing Qualified Lead’s or MQL activity in the second half of the quarter. On the left-hand side of the page, we illustrate the sequential order we saw throughout the quarter. February saw 5% sequential order growth as compared to January, and March, organic orders were up 18% sequentially versus February. Consistently with our initial guidance, book-to-bill was above 1x at 1.02x in the quarter, continued to build backlog in support of our organic growth targets."", 'As we had mentioned on our last earnings called Q1 2024, had some very tough comps due to large and long cycle project order timing. For a two-year stack, organic orders remain positive. Moving now to the right hand side of the page, we illustrate our MQL activity acceleration throughout the 1st quarter of this year. In Q1 2024, MQLs finished up 4% year-over-year, and this is on top of 9% growth in Q1 of the prior year. We remain encouraged by sequential momentum in MQLs throughout the quarter, where we saw an 11% increase in MQLs during the second half of the quarter as compared to the first half of the quarter. We do acknowledge that market conditions are constantly changing, and we remain nimble and prepared to pivot with those changing market conditions.', 'I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance.', ""Vikram Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On slide nine, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenues declined 7% and 1% year-over-year respectively. Both organic orders and revenue finished largely in line with expectations given the tough comps from the prior year. However, we did see approximately $15 million of revenue shift out of Q1 and into Q2 due primarily to customer site readiness, an additional headwind of approximately 1% due to FX as compared to our initial guidance. The year-over-year decline in organic orders was primarily driven by the timing of large long-cycle orders. It's important to note that on a two year stack, total company organic orders and revenue grew 1% and 20% year-over-year respectively."", 'We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year as well as our book-to-bill for the quarter, which was 1.02x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on for the balance of the year and gives us conviction and delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $459 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, a 290 basis point year-over-year improvement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78 for the quarter, which is up 20% as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million and total liquidity was $3.5 billion with $1.5 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 0.7 turns, which is 0.4 turns better than the prior year.', 'Turning to slide 10, for the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q1 orders declined 4% and revenue declined 3%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 370 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 290 basis points. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by 390 basis points of gross margin expansion, largely driven by our continued execution of i2V initiatives and pricing. Partially offsetting this gross margin expansion were investments in SG&A centered around commercial footprint and R&D initiatives. Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter, and finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 20% year-over-year to $0.78 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%.', ""On the next slide, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. This repurchase authorization is incremental to the remaining amount on the existing $750 million authorization and is currently expected to start being executed against in the first quarter of 2025. Much like the prior authorization, we would expect to utilize the new $1 billion share repurchase authorization over a three year time period. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and share repurchases are an important part of that strategy. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, including CapEx, which totaled $62 million."", 'The year-over-year decline in free cash flow of $49 million was driven primarily by two factors. First approximately $40 million of CapEx timing. As outlined in our guidance, our expected CapEx spend remains unchanged at approximately 2% of revenue for the full year. And second, approximately $20 million of interest payment timing. Due to the bond issuance completed in August of 2023, interest payments on those bonds are now made twice per year as compared to our prior structure, which was generally paid evenly over the course of the year. This will normalize as we move throughout the year. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.5 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $2 billion availability on our revolving credit facility.', 'Leverage for the quarter was 0.7 turns, which was a 0.4 turn improvement year-over-year. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $143 million deployed to M&A, as well as $81 million returned to shareholders, of which $73 million of the share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.', 'Vicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Service segments deliver solid year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on top of outsized growth in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30% up 370 basis points from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.02x, with organic orders down approximately 7%. Moving to the product highlight, compressors were down high single digits, primarily driven by large, long-cycle project order timing, primarily in the renewable natural gas in the U.S., and EV battery and solar projects in China. Excluding these items, organic orders in compressors were approximately flat year-over-year. Important to note that on a two-year stag, compressor orders are up low double digits and revenue is up mid-30s.', ""Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up high single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. On a two-year stag, vacuum and blower orders were up mid-single digits and revenue is up low 40s. For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle new vacuum pump technology, which was recently launched in EMEA. This patented oil-free technology ensures no air contamination or waste, which is ideal for high-growth, sustainable end markets like food and beverage, pharma, and medical. This product also offers an almost 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to equivalent liquid green technology, enabling productivity for customer and also reducing total cost of ownership. Turning to slide 13, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $91 million with a margin of 30.8%."", ""Organic orders in the PST segment were down approximately 5% year-over-year. The decline in orders was driven primarily by softness in life sciences and expected declines in China wastewater end markets. It is important to note and encouraging that life science business saw more than 15% increase sequentially in order momentum in Q1 2024 as compared to Q4 of 2023. In addition, short-cycle orders in the PST segment remain strong with book-and-ship orders up high single digits sequentially. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term investor-day growth commitments. For PST Innovation in Action, we're highlighting a great recurring revenue opportunity with ELCOM."", ""ELCOM is a range of comprehensive end-to-end IIoT solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing infrastructure that enable monitoring, controlling, and optimization of operations. In this slide, we show one application of ELCOM system to monitor and control gas pressure on the distribution grid that can help utility companies reduce emissions by up to 10%. We see these as a great opportunity for recurring revenue through subscription-based software and services. As we move to slide 14, given the solid performance in Q1, we're raising our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 4% to 6%, which is down 100 basis points versus prior initial guidance, driven entirely by FX. We anticipate positive organic growth of 2% to 4%, consistent with prior guidance, where price and volume remains split at approximately 70/30."", 'FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is 100 basis points headwind as compared to our initial guide. M&A is projected at approximately $170 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1st of 2024. ILC Dover is not included in these figures and is expected to close later in the quarter. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth in demand generation activities, as well as investments in IR digital and other IT-related investments. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.94 billion and $2 billion, which is up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint.', 'At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.20 and $3.30, which is up 2% versus prior guidance, and approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full-year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our initial guidance provided in February. As you can see, the primary driver of EPS growth is associated with operational activity related to improve incremental and operational performance. As I mentioned earlier, FX is the largest headwind driving approximately 100 basis points of total revenue declines and a $0.04 of EPS headwinds. Total interest expense is now expected to be approximately $130 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year.', ""No changes have been made to our guidance on the full-year adjusted tax rate, CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion or share count, all remain in line with initial guidance. Turning to slide 15, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a very strong position. We continue to deliver record results, and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing momentum. Our M&A funnel remains strong, and with acquisitions announced and close today, we're poised for a record year of annualized inorganic growth. We remain nimble, and we're prepared to pivot with the constantly changing market conditions. To our employees, I want to thank you one more time for an excellent start to the year."", 'These results show the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency, and focused actions. We believe the power of IRX combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolio strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders.

(NYSE:DHI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 241% in five years. In the last week the share price is up 2.2%.', ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton ', 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During five years of share price growth, D.R. Horton achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 29% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 28% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""Dive deeper into D.R. Horton's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of D.R. Horton's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of D.R. Horton, it has a TSR of 259% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""We're pleased to report that D.R. Horton shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 29% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

(NYSE:AWK) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest first-quarter results, and the shares gained 6.6% to US$129. It was a pretty mixed result, with revenues beating expectations to hit US$1.0b. Statutory earnings fell 3.2% short of analyst forecasts, reaching US$0.95 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for American Water Works Company ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from American Water Works Company's nine analysts is for revenues of US$4.53b in 2024. This reflects an okay 5.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 6.7% to US$5.25. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.43b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.25 in 2024. There doesn't appear to have been a major change in sentiment following the results, other than the small lift in revenue estimates."", 'Even though revenue forecasts increased, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$137, suggesting the analysts are focused on earnings as the driver of value creation. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on American Water Works Company, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$159 and the most bearish at US$123 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that American Water Works Company's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 6.9% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 3.4% p.a. over the past five years. Other similar companies in the industry (with analyst coverage) are also forecast to grow their revenue at 6.7% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that American Water Works Company is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. There was also an upgrade to revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$137, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Our company's purpose serving customers and building stronger communities remains at the center of everything we do. I will highlight a few of our key 2024 achievements and then turn the call over to Lisa and Robert to provide more updates as well as additional details relating to our operations, financial performance and key regulatory matters. I'll start by highlighting the successful execution of our strategic solar investments."", ""These investments play an important role in our balanced generation portfolio, a portfolio that delivers safe, resilient and reliable energy to our customers. Our final solar project in Wisconsin is near completion, which signifies the culmination of our planned 1.1 gigawatts of solar investment in the state and providing long-term value to our customers. The completion of this investment solidifies our position as the largest owner-operator of solar generation in Wisconsin. When constructing our renewable generation, we follow the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure framework called Envision. Using this framework, we design projects to enhance environmental, social and economic impacts. I'm pleased to report that so far, we've received platinum Envision certification for four of our Wisconsin solar projects."", 'We also made progress on our solar investments in Iowa, our 50 megawatt solar project in Linn County just outside of Cedar Rapids is now operational, and we remain on track for completing the remaining 350 megawatts in the state by the end of 2024. These strategic investments in solar energy are enhancing customer value by providing zero fuel cost resources, tax credits and creating a more balanced energy mix for our customers. This balance is critical to delivering reliable and resilient energy to our customers. And in addition, these solar projects contribute to local economies by generating new job opportunities and revenues. Another exciting milestone for our company is achieving the halfway mark on our commitment to planting one million trees, one tree for every electric customer.', ""The effort is to plant these trees is rooted in our commitment to our customers and the communities we proudly serve. Before I turn it over to Lisa, I want to share some exciting recognition we've recently received. We've been named to Newsweek's list of most trustworthy companies in America for the third year in a row. And for the second year in a row, we earned the highly coveted VETS Indexes Employer Award, recognizing our focus on hiring, retaining, and supporting our veterans and the military-connected community.

I'll now turn the call over to Lisa."", 'Lisa Barton: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John stated, we had a solid start to the year and we are well-positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings and growth objectives. Warmer than normal temperatures impacted our first quarter earnings, reflecting similar temperatures experienced in the broader region. It is early in the year and we have focused our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business and have already made progress implementing cost controls and executing on our customer investments in accordance with our plan. As John mentioned, we have a long track record of consistent operational and financial execution, a principal reason for your confidence in Alliant Energy. Delivering on the expectations of our customers, communities, regulators and investors is foundational for Alliant Energy and we are committed to continuing to evolve and adapt to meet those expectations on a year-over-year basis.', ""Executing on our investment strategy is key to our ongoing success. Building on John's comments about our notable solar progress, we are on track to surpass the 3 gigawatt mark of clean, zero-fuel cost energy resources for our customers. In addition to our utility-scale solar investments, we remain committed to partnering with local businesses interested in hosting solar projects. For example, in Iowa, we recently broke ground on four customer-hosted solar projects in Grinnell. Alliant Energy operates in business-friendly states that are well-positioned for growth and economic development. Recently passed legislation in both states will establish Iowa and Wisconsin for accelerated economic growth opportunities. In Wisconsin, the sales and use tax exemption for data centers supports attraction of these types of customers."", ""The IRA conformance bill aligns federal and state tax policies, enabling a smooth transfer of renewable credits to Wisconsin companies. And the electric vehicle bill is intended to advance fleet electrification efforts across the state. In Iowa, two key pieces of legislation were signed into law. The Mega Project Bill provides incentives to attract large businesses to Iowa. Our Prairie View Industrial Center in Ames and Big Cedar Industrial Center in Cedar Rapids currently meet the criteria specified in the legislation. The Public Utilities Bill makes nuclear and electric storage eligible technologies for advanced rate-making. This legislation is a clear articulation of the state's support to grow business in the state and to ensure a diverse range of resources are developed to support that growth."", ""I'm proud of our team's impactful and proactive engagement with the legislatures. The implementation of these business-friendly policies will foster an environment conducive to growth opportunities, help us attract new companies to the area, and support growth in the communities we serve. Iowa and Wisconsin are open for business, and Alliance Energy is here to support not only the customers we currently serve, but also to ensure that we are supporting the needs of future customers and community growth across our service territory. Looking ahead, we are evolving and refining our clean energy blueprint. This evaluation is a necessary step as we focus on balancing our energy mix, creating greater grid reliability, ensuring customer affordability, and addressing MISO's resource adequacy needs."", ""The results of our updated resource plan will be included in our third quarter capital expenditure update. Our open and transparent resource planning process allows us to be nimble in responding and preparing for the needs of our customers and communities, another key differentiator in the states we serve, ensuring our ability to be nimble, support and grow with our customers. Before I turn the call over to Robert, I want to reiterate that we are well positioned to deliver on both customer and investor expectations. We've implemented significant measures to mitigate risk while enhancing reliability. As we continue to execute our strategy, we're uniquely positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic environment. I would like to echo John's appreciation for our employees who make what we do possible and ensure our continued ability to deliver outstanding value to our customers and meet investor expectations."", ""At this time, I'll turn the call over to Robert."", ""Robert Durian: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2024 earnings of $0.62 per share, compared to first quarter 2023 earnings of $0.65 per share. The quarter-over-quarter variances were mainly driven by the successful execution of WPL's customer focused capital investment program, which supported new electric and gas rates that took effect on January 1st, and the higher financing and depreciation expenses associated with such capital investments. However, the quarter-over-quarter variances were also impacted by historically mild temperatures. Our service territory experienced the warmest first quarter on record for both Cedar Rapids and Madison since 2012. Temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2024."", ""In comparison, temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings in the first quarter of 2023 by $0.04 per share. Temperature normalized electric sales to Wisconsin retail customers were relatively flat in the first quarter of 2024. In Iowa, residential sales were higher in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to last year. We continued to experience solid growth in the number of residential customers in both states. However, these positive drivers were offset by decreased electric sales to commercial and industrial customers in Iowa, largely due to lower sales to lower-margin cogeneration customers. We continue to make progress with lowering operating expenses to achieve our financial objectives and support customer affordability."", ""In fact, first quarter 2024 other operation and maintenance expenses were almost $15 million less than the first quarter of 2023. Through our diverse generation portfolio, and execution of our robust fuel risk management programs, we are also keeping natural gas and electric energy costs in check. Our natural gas customers benefited from this trend as average retail builds in the first quarter of 2024 were approximately 25% lower than the first quarter of 2023. Turning to cash flows. First quarter 2024 cash flows from operations increased by over $100 million when compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to the timing of WPL's fuel related cost recoveries and WPL's electric and gas rate increases, which were effective January 1st of this year."", 'Looking forward, we expect continued improvement in our cash flow metrics as a result of the aforementioned drivers, as well as increasing levels of tax credit monetization. We recently executed agreements on tax credit transfers that cover both 2024 and 2025 credits expected to be generated at WPL and IPO. We are also making progress in executing our $1.7 billion financing plans for 2024, largely to fund our investments in renewable and battery projects and support refinancing $800 million in debt maturities this year. To date, we have issued a $300 million green bond at WPL and refinanced our $300 million term loan at Alliant Energy Finance. Later this quarter, we expect to receive approximately $120 million from the sales of partial interest in West Riverside.', ""And this year, we expect to raise approximately $25 million in equity under our DRIP plan. Finally, I will highlight our regulatory initiatives in progress as well as some regulatory filings we plan to initiate later this year. IPL's rate reviews continue to advance through their procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa last year. These rate reviews focus on recovery of customer-focused investments in Iowa that support building a more reliable, sustainable and resilient energy future. Strengthening the energy grid as energy demand and extreme weather threats increase and diversifying our generation resources. Last month, interveners in IPL's electric and gas rate review proceeding filed their direct testimony."", 'We were not surprised by the interveners comments as divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the process. We stand by the investments we have made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. On slide 10, we have provided the procedural schedule to help monitor the progress of the rate review proceedings. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months after the filing. Therefore, we anticipate a decision in the third quarter of this year. We have requested new rates to be implemented effective October 1. Turning to Wisconsin. We have two pending proceedings in progress. We filed our annual Wisconsin fuel reconciliation for 2023 in the first quarter.', 'At the conclusion of the fuel reconciliation process, we expect to refund over $30 million to our Wisconsin customers. And we requested authority to invest in reliability enhancements at our Riverside Generating Station. We are anticipating decisions from the PSCW on both of these dockets later this year. Turning to our planned regulatory filings in 2024. We expect to make regulatory filings in both Iowa and Wisconsin later this year. For additional renewables and dispatchable resources, following our routine, continuous modeling updates of our Clean Energy Blueprint. We expect these projects will enhance reliability as well as further diversify and balance our energy resources to meet customer energy needs. In closing, we are positioning for another year of consistent 5% to 7% growth in adjusted earnings per share.', ""We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $2.99 to $3.13 per share. As a reminder, our guidance is based on constructive and timely outcomes of our regulatory proceedings, execution of cost controls and normal weather in our service territory for the remainder of the year. We will continue to manage our business to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures, enable operational efficiency and deliver long-term consistency. We very much appreciate the continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you later this month.
