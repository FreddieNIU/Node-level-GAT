But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) share price is up 82% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 16% (not including dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 7.2% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 22% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Charles Schwab the TSR over the last 3 years was 89%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Charles Schwab returned a loss of 8.7% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

It has amassed assets over $13.74 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Additionally, growth stocks have a greater level of risk associated with them. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.54%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 58% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc. Com (AAPL) accounts for about 12.86% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corporation Com (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. Com (AMZN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 56.48% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHG seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted and includes the large-cap growth portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has gained about 1.37% so far this year and is down about -26.88% in the last one year (as of 01/11/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $54.19 and $78.83.The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 29.71% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 229 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. LargeCap Growth ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHG is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $69.23 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $148.13 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NUE, Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD, TimkenSteel Corp. TMST and Olympic Steel, Inc. ZEUS.Industry: SteelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2037095/4-steel-producer-stocks-to-buy-from-a-promising-industryThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is poised to ride on a recovery in demand in automotive, a major market, as the semiconductor crisis gradually eases and automakers ramp up production. The sizable infrastructure investment also augurs well for the U.S. steel industry. Steel prices are also likely to gain support from demand recovery and infrastructure spending.A resilient non-residential construction market and healthy demand in the energy space also represent tailwinds for the industry. Players from the industry like Nucor Corp., Steel Dynamics, Inc., TimkenSteel Corp. and Olympic Steel, Inc. are well-placed to gain from these trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Steel Producers industry serves a vast spectrum of end-use industries such as automotive, construction, appliance, container, packaging, industrial machinery, mining equipment, transportation, and oil and gas with various steel products. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets and blooms, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products.Steel is primarily produced using two methods — Blast Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace. It is regarded as the backbone of the manufacturing industry. The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. Notably, the housing and construction sector is the biggest consumer of steel, accounting for roughly half of the world’s total consumption.What's Shaping the Future of the Steel Producers' Industry?Demand Strength in Major End-use Markets: Steel producers are set to gain from a rebound in demand across major steel end-use markets such as automotive, construction and machinery from the coronavirus-led downturn. They are expected to benefit from higher-order booking from the automotive market in 2023.Story continuesSteel demand in automotive is expected to improve this year on the back of an easing of a global shortage in semiconductor chips that weighed heavily on the automotive industry for nearly two years. Low dealer inventories and pent-up demand are likely to be supporting factors.Order activities in the non-residential construction market also remain strong, underscoring the inherent strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has also improved on the back of an uptick in oil and gas prices. Favorable trends across these markets augur well for the steel industry.Auto Recovery, Infrastructure Spending to Aid Steel Prices: Steel prices witnessed a sharp correction globally in 2022 as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, skyrocketing energy costs in Europe, persistently high inflation, interest rate hikes and the slowdown in China due to new COVID-19 lockdowns dwindled demand for steel across key end-use markets.Notably, U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand and fears of a recession.However, prices have found some support of late from U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions and a recovery in demand. A rebound in automotive demand is also expected to give a boost to steel prices this year.The massive infrastructure development project is also likely to be a catalyst for the American steel industry and U.S. HRC prices in 2023. The sizable federal infrastructure spending would have a beneficial effect on the U.S. steel industry, given the expected rise in consumption of the commodity.Slowdown in China a Cause for Concern: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened since the second half of 2021 due to a slowdown in the country’s economy. New lockdowns are taking a significant toll on the world’s second-largest economy. A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to a contraction in demand for steel in China.The manufacturing sector has taken a beating as the virus resurgence has hurt demand for manufactured goods and supply chains. China has also seen a slowdown across the construction and property sectors. The country’s real estate sector has taken a hard hit from repeated lockdowns. Investment in the sector has slowed to its lowest level in roughly three decades. The slowdown in these key steel-consuming sectors is expected to hurt demand for steel over the short term.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #9, which places it at the top 4% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Steel Producers industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector over the past year.The industry has gained 2.2% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 18% and the broader sector’s decline of 3.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing steel stocks, the industry is currently trading at 3.89X, below the S&amp;P 500’s 11.75X and the sector’s 7.85X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 11.52X, as low as 2.48X and at the median of 6.71X.4 Steel Producers Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnNucor: Charlotte, NC-based Nucor, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), makes steel and steel products with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The company is benefiting from strength in the non-residential construction market. It is also seeing improved conditions in heavy equipment, agriculture and renewable energy markets.Nucor should also gain from considerable market opportunities from its strategic investments in its most-significant growth projects. NUE remains committed to boosting production capacity, which should drive growth and strengthen its position as a low-cost producer.Nucor’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 3.1%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings for NUE has been revised 15.9% upward over the past 60 days.

It is benefiting from its strong liquidity position, actions to lower operating expenses, and strength in its pipe and tube and specialty metals businesses.Improving industrial market conditions and a rebound in demand are expected to support its volumes. The company’s strong balance sheet also allows it to invest in higher-return growth opportunities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Olympic Steel’s 2023 earnings has been revised 21.1% upward over the past 60 days. ZEUS has also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. In this time frame, it has delivered an average earnings surprise of roughly 25.4%.TimkenSteel: Ohio-based TimkenSteel engages in manufacturing alloy steel, as well as carbon and micro-alloy steel. The company is benefiting from higher industrial and energy demand and a favorable pricing environment, notwithstanding the semiconductor supply-chain disruptions that are affecting shipments to mobile customers.TMST is seeing continued recovery in its industrial markets. Higher end-market demand and cost-reduction actions are also aiding its performance. It is gaining from its efforts to improve its cost structure and manufacturing efficiency.TimkenSteel, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of 28.9% for 2023.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This insurance company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 31.57%.For the most recent quarter, Unum was expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share, but it reported $1.51 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7.86%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.23 per share, while it actually produced $1.91 per share, a surprise of 55.28%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Unum, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Unum has an Earnings ESP of +2.12% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 31, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NARI) shares rallied 5.6% in the last trading session to close at $67.56. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 8.1% loss over the past four weeks.Share price rise was driven by better-than-expected sales during the fourth quarter, per preliminary results. The company also provided revenue guidance of $470 million to $480 million for full-year 2023, which was also higher than market expectations.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -950%. Revenues are expected to be $98.93 million, up 18.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Inari Medical, Inc., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation.

To see more such companies, go directly to Mormon Church's 5 Biggest Stock Positions.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon Church, has over $40 billion worth of stocks positions as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 via Ensign Peak Advisors, which is a Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm that manages the Church’s money as its investment fund. The Mormon Church’s huge investments in the US stock market remained a secret for several decades. In 2019, David A. Nielsen, a former employee of Ensign Peak Advisors, approached the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with a complaint, according to a 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Citing some former employees of the fund, the WSJ report at the time said that the Mormon Church’s investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, had assets worth about $80 billion to $100 billion as of 2019, which easily surpass some of the biggest funds in the world such as Harvard University’s endowment and come at par with giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund.The WSJ report also claimed that the fund was under no legal obligation to report its finances, and its employees sign lifetime confidentiality agreements. The report said that David A. Nielsen, the whistleblower who revealed the multi-billion dollar secret of the Mormon Church, was of the view that the church should be transparent about its finances.The WSJ interviewed Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak at the time, who said that the fund and its size was kept a secret because the church relies on donations and public revelations about the investment fund could possibly discourage potential donors.“Paying tithing [donations] is more of a sense of commitment than it is the church needing the money…So they never wanted to be in a position where people felt like, you know, they shouldn’t make a contribution,” Clarke reportedly said.Photo by Michael Hart on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ensign Peak Advisors’ 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 positions of the fund. A cursory look at the list shows that the Mormon Church is invested in major, blue-chip companies and also have large positions in big tech companies. As expected, the Church steers clear of the sin stocks that usually operate in business domains like casinos, tobacco, adult entertainment and related areas.Mormon Church's 15 Biggest Stock Positions15.

CTAS and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW.3 Top Picks from a Hot Industrial Products IndustryInvestors can insert themselves into favorable trends within the market by targeting sectors witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions.That’s precisely what the Zacks Industrial Products sector has seen lately, which has pushed it up to the #1 spot out of all Zacks 16 sectors.And as we’re all aware, 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to its group, further stating the importance of targeting areas that analysts have recently become bullish on.The sector has displayed remarkable relative strength over the last three months, up nearly 20% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 8% gain.Three stocks from the sector – Crane Holdings, Cintas Corp. andW.W. Grainger Inc. – could all be considerations for those looking to tap into the relative strength.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Crane HoldingsCrane Holdings is a diversified manufacturer of engineered industrial products with four business segments: Aerospace and Electronics, Process Flow Technologies, Payment and Merchandising Technology, and Engineered Materials. CR sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Many stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector pay dividends, and Crane is no different; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.8%, a few ticks higher than its Zacks sector average.In addition, CR’s valuation multiples don’t appear stretched by any means, further reinforced by its Style Score of a “B” for Value.

To see more such companies, go directly to Mormon Church's 5 Biggest Stock Positions.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon Church, has over $40 billion worth of stocks positions as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 via Ensign Peak Advisors, which is a Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm that manages the Church’s money as its investment fund. The Mormon Church’s huge investments in the US stock market remained a secret for several decades. In 2019, David A. Nielsen, a former employee of Ensign Peak Advisors, approached the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with a complaint, according to a 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Citing some former employees of the fund, the WSJ report at the time said that the Mormon Church’s investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, had assets worth about $80 billion to $100 billion as of 2019, which easily surpass some of the biggest funds in the world such as Harvard University’s endowment and come at par with giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund.The WSJ report also claimed that the fund was under no legal obligation to report its finances, and its employees sign lifetime confidentiality agreements. The report said that David A. Nielsen, the whistleblower who revealed the multi-billion dollar secret of the Mormon Church, was of the view that the church should be transparent about its finances.The WSJ interviewed Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak at the time, who said that the fund and its size was kept a secret because the church relies on donations and public revelations about the investment fund could possibly discourage potential donors.“Paying tithing [donations] is more of a sense of commitment than it is the church needing the money…So they never wanted to be in a position where people felt like, you know, they shouldn’t make a contribution,” Clarke reportedly said.Photo by Michael Hart on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ensign Peak Advisors’ 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 positions of the fund. A cursory look at the list shows that the Mormon Church is invested in major, blue-chip companies and also have large positions in big tech companies. As expected, the Church steers clear of the sin stocks that usually operate in business domains like casinos, tobacco, adult entertainment and related areas.Mormon Church's 15 Biggest Stock Positions15.

Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15.

BERY benefits from its robust product portfolio, the bulk of which includes consumer non-discretionary products, despite inflationary increases in costs and expenses and challenges related to supply chain and labor.Berry Global’s Consumer Packaging North America segment is driven by strength in its consumer businesses across the food and beverage end markets.

Tinker said, adding that this was leading investors to make small bets in markets, helping to set the more positive tone.""There is no real dominant conviction to it yet. Right now people are tilting a bit away from 'there's going to be a second leg',"" he said.The U.S. earnings season moves into higher gear on Friday, with results from big banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup to offer clues on the economic outlook.Staff at Goldman Sachs were braced for news on whether they will keep their jobs in a cull instigated after a massive slowdown in corporate dealmaking since the war in Ukraine.CPI WATCHInvestor attention is squarely on the U.S. consumer price data due on Thursday.

However, ample stocks and weak demand in China have doused the appetite for fresh shipments with the other utilities yet to book cargoes, three industrial sources told Reuters.An Australian mining executive said their company received enquires from Chinese coal buyers for cargoes of metallurgical and thermal coal in late November - around the time that the leaders of China and Australia met during the G20 conference - on the availability for cargoes for the first half of 2023, which he described as ""tyre-kicking"".However, there have been no queries this week, he said.""The easing of Australian coal import restriction coincide with the approach of Lunar New Year ... in the short term, coal purchase from Chinese utilities remains tepid ... and the impact of the return of Aussie coal still requires further observation,"" Zhang Huan, an analyst from China-based coal consultancy Yimei, said in a note.Average daily coal consumption at utilities in the eight Chinese coastal regions, a key indicator of coal demand, was 2.03 million tonnes as of last week, down 12% from the same period last year, according to data compiled by the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association (CCTD).Story continuesCoal storage at power plants were 30.5 million tonnes, around 9% lower year-on-year, ahead of week-long Lunar New Year celebration that starts on Jan 21st.That is too high ""to generate much buying interest of Australian coal,"" a manager from a state-backed utility said.Analysts from China-based coal consultancy Ocoal.com said in a note on Monday that industrial power consumption is facing a double whammy of swelling COVID infections and the holiday season, causing a slow de-stocking at the utilities.(Reporting by Muyu Xu and Melanie Burton; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)]"

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.25 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.9%.Revenues are expected to be $12.17 billion, down 16.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Morgan Stanley?For Morgan Stanley, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Morgan Stanley will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Morgan Stanley would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +1.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Morgan Stanley doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LOUIS, Jan. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- As the world faces stiff economic headwinds and Europe grapples with a deepening energy crisis with global impacts, a recent survey conducted by FleishmanHillard found that business leaders around the world expect investment reductions in key areas while renewing desires for a balanced approach to climate and energy. They expect fossil fuels to be given a prolonged role given supply shortages in Europe and the UK.The energy crisis and inflation are affecting consumers' cost of living and industries globally, creating both challenges and opportunities for business. FleishmanHillard's TRUE Global Intelligence wanted to learn more and surveyed nearly 900 business leaders in nine countries: China, France, Germany, India, Italy, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States to understand their perspective related to the European energy crisis and expectations for the coming year.Sixty-one percent of the executives said they were ""very concerned"" about inflation, followed by tensions between the West and Russia (53%) and the European energy crisis (51%). Concern about climate change and extreme weather was fourth at 42%, which was ahead of the frosty China-U.S. relationship (33%).Some 61% of those surveyed also said inflation was having a large or very large impact on their business. Eight in 10 (79%) said they expected poverty to grow as a result of Europe's energy crisis and global increase in energy costs due to supply constraints, while nearly the same level expects the crisis to accelerate the growth of renewable energy production (76%).Nearly six in 10 executives (59%) worldwide said the best way to respond to Europe's energy crisis is to increase investments in renewable energy. Seventy-two percent of respondents said it was likely or very or somewhat likely that policymakers would ease efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Story continues""Despite the challenging economic and energy supply challenges today, business leaders generally agree that governments and industry should remain steadfast on climate and decarbonization efforts,"" Maximo Miccinilli, head of Energy and Climate for FleishmanHillard in Europe, said. ""But they also expect policymakers to ease the energy transition while their companies take steps to reduce investments and costs, in part due to inflation.""The research also found:U.S. executives were the most likely to say the priority should be increasing energy supplies, at 37%, followed by Germany respondents at 34% and China and UK respondents at 32%.South Korea and Spain executives were the most likely to say climate action should be prioritized, at 33% and 24%, respectively.Chinese executives were highest in expecting to reduce their investments in climate and sustainability projects, at 33%. Germany was second at 29%.European executives who face the greatest challenge from the energy crisis said it would force their companies to reduce investments. They noted areas most likely to be cut include recruiting new employees (42%), mergers and acquisitions (35%) and employee benefits and perks (31%).Business leaders in natural gas-dependent states, including Italy, Spain and France, were the most likely to say the energy crisis would have a large or very large impact on their business, reflecting where the crisis is hitting the hardest. At 35%, France was the highest among individual countries expecting to cut investments; UK business leaders were second at 25%.A majority of executives globally (72%), including nuclear-averse Germany (76%), believe consumers will become more accepting of nuclear power due to the energy crisis.FleishmanHillard's Public Affairs specialists help clients around the world monitor and manage policy and regulatory risk and identify and leverage opportunities in response to changing issues.

Gas prices are a bit lower again today and that might be contributing to an unwind of the move yesterday,"" Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor said.Yields on German 10-year Bunds, by 1619 GMT, fell 12.5 basis points (bps) to 2.18%, its lowest since Dec. 19, more than reversing Tuesday's 9-bp rise.Yields on the two-year Schatz - the most sensitive to expectations for interest rates and inflation - dropped 2.5 bps to 2.62%.A market-based gauge of longer-term inflation expectations was last at 2.34%, having edged down from an eight-month peak of 2.4% in late December.At a central banking conference in Stockholm on Tuesday, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel indicated rates had further to go from the current 2.0%, given inflation is still running at 9.7%.""We judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target,"" she said.Story continuesThe ECB is forecasting a gradual decline in inflation but only approaching its 2% target within three years.Europe's energy crisis, which has unfolded while governments were still battling to contain the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, is one of the drivers of this year's record wave of new bond issuance.The German Finance Agency sold 4.508 billion euros of its new 2.3% 10-year Bund for a yield of 2.25%. This was up from the 1.95% achieved at the last auction for paper of this maturity.This is the first major auction of what will be a monster year for euro zone government debt supply. The U.S. Treasury, meanwhile, auctions 10-year notes and it is this sale that could serve as a key gauge of investor appetite, analysts said.""Central banks 'sticking to their (inflation management) knitting’ doesn’t seem to scare bonds any more. Supply does though,"" ING strategists led by Padraig Garvey said in a note.""Even if it's quiet for euro sovereigns today, pay more attention than usual to the U.S. 10-year auction outcome. The recent flow into money market funds questions the demand for duration. The U.S. 10-year auction will test that,"" they said.Duration is measured in years and refers to how long the holder of a bond must wait for coupon payments and the return of the principal. The higher the duration, the longer the bondholder must wait for repayment.In a rising rate environment, bond investors tend to reduce the duration of their portfolios. The longer the duration, the higher the losses if rates rise.Bund yields rose by almost 3 full percentage points in 2022, their biggest annual rise since at least the mid-1950s.The U.S. Treasury will hold an auction of 10-year notes later. Yields on the current benchmark 10-year note were down 4 bps at 3.579%.Elsewhere, yields on 10-year Italian BTPs fell 17.5 bps to 4.04%, while two-year yields fell 8 bps to 3.05%.Beyond the euro zone, investors are awaiting U.S. consumer inflation data for December, which is due on Thursday, and could offer a steer on how quickly U.S. rates are likely to peak.

As of 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, approximately 108,000 customers remain without power. More than half of those outages are currently in the South Bay and Central Coast regions, which have been particularly hard hit by rain, wind, soil saturation and widespread flooding.An intense wind and rain event came on shore early Tuesday morning along the Central Coast, leading to significant flooding, fallen trees, mud slides, road closures, and other hazardous conditions. In some cases, these conditions are delaying crews from assessing the causes of outages and restoring power. Crews continue to work very closely with local government and emergency management agencies to address emergency situations. As conditions permit, they will be working safely and as quickly as possible to continue assessing damage and dispatching crews for repairs and power restoration.This is the single largest winter storm response in PG&amp;E's history, with more than 6,500 PG&amp;E personnel, contractor and mutual aid partners from across North America working to restore power to customers in communities across California.Keeping Customers InformedCustomers can view real-time outage information at PG&amp;E's online outage center and search by a specific address, by city or by county. This site has been updated to include support in 16 languages.PG&amp;E has also begun publishing county-specific outage information throughout the day and is posting regular updates on its storm response at www.pgecurrents.com.Story continuesAdditionally, customers can sign up for outage notifications by text, email, or phone. PG&amp;E will let customers know the cause of an outage, when crews are on their way, the estimated restoration time and when power has been restored.PG&amp;E is coordinating with its community-based partners to offer support to customers in need. PG&amp;E partners with the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers to offer support for older adults and people with disabilities through the Disability Disaster Access and Resources Program. As well, as the California Network of 2-1-1 who can connect customers to resources in their local communities.Storm Safety Tips Never touch downed wires: If you see a downed power line, assume it is energized and extremely dangerous. Do not touch or try to move it—and keep children and animals away. Report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5002.Use generators safely: Customers with standby electric generators should ensure they are properly installed by a licensed electrician in a well-ventilated area. Improperly installed generators pose a significant danger to customers, as well as crews working on powerlines. If using portable generators, be sure they are in a well-ventilated area.Use flashlights, not candles: During a power outage, use battery-operated flashlights and not candles, due to the risk of fire. And keep extra batteries on hand. If you must use candles, please keep them away from drapes, lampshades, animals and small children. Do not leave candles unattended.Have a backup phone: If you have a telephone system that requires electricity to work, such as a cordless phone or answering machine, plan to have a standard telephone or cellular phone ready as a backup. Having a portable charging device helps to keep your cell phone running.Have fresh drinking water and ice: Freeze plastic containers filled with water to make blocks of ice that can be placed in your refrigerator/freezer to prevent food spoilage.Turn off appliances: If you experience an outage, unplug or turn off all electrical appliances to avoid overloading circuits and to prevent fire hazards when power is restored. Simply leave a single lamp on to alert you when power returns.Safely clean up: After the storm has passed, be sure to safely clean up. Never touch downed wires and always call 8-1-1 or visit 811express.com at least two full business days before digging to have all underground utilities safely marked.Other tips can be found at: Safety and Preparedness, Storm Safety, and Safety Action Center.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now.The oil industry notched record gains in 2022 and analysts are hopeful that the industry would continue to post record profits this year as they see no end in sight to the catalysts that gave boost to oil companies in the previous year. According to a latest report by Deloitte, in 2022, the global upstream industry was projected to generate its highest-ever free cash flows of $1.4 trillion at an assumed average Brent oil price of $106/bbl.Recently, the International Energy Agency said that Russia’s output could decline by 14% in the first quarter of 2023. If Russia’s production declines, oil prices, which started the year on a lower note, could again start to climb towards new highs. The IEA believes that the full effects of the oil embargo on Russia would begin to show its effects in the coming weeks. The agency also increased its oil demand forecasts for 2023 by 300,000 barrels a day, mainly due to growth in India and China’s decision to remove COVID restrictions. Consumption in the year, according to the agency, is expected to grow by a whopping 1.7 million barrels a day to reach 101.6 million barrels a day.JPMorgan in December also outlined its bullish thesis for the oil industry. According to Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan analysts said that while recession will keep the global economic growth in check, the oil industry will see a strong growth as countries like China begin to remove COVID restrictions. JPMorgan thinks that mobility fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel will drive much of the demand increase.JPMorgan also said that the G7 price cap would not be able to affect the Russian oil production significantly, while countries including the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Norway and Guyana will combine to boost global production.According to JPMorgan, the price of Brent crude will average $90 per barrel in 2023 and end the year at about $94.Story continuesIn addition to the fundamental growth, the oil and gas industry will continue to pour billions in the green energy space. The Deloitte report said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act will provide for about $450 billion of clean energy and related investments. The report also mentioned the Fit for 55 climate package passed by the European Commission and also the REPowerEU plan, which was launched to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. The report said that together, the committed provisions for the clean energy transition and emissions reduction are close to €300 billion.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey proprietary database of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 American oil stocks. These oil stocks have solid fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. The list is ranked in an ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now11. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Ranking 11th on the list of the best American oil stocks, Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is a New York-based company that is involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. In early December, Hess (NYSE:HES) declared a $0.375/share quarterly dividend, in line with the previous. A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes is $1.22 billion.In December, Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai upped the price target for Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) to $155 from $145 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The update came after the company posted Q3 results.10. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is a major American energy company that performed exceptionally well in 2022. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) gained about 60% over the past 12 months. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is also a dividend payer, with over a 3% dividend yield as of January 9. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) plans to cut its debt in the coming months. As of the end of the third quarter, the refiner’s debt came in at $5.6 billion. During the third quarter earnings call, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)’s management said that it has been working in the “right direction” since its debt to market cap ratio is 24.5% as of the end of Q3, compared to 40% during the COVID crisis.9. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a Texas-based company that accounts for a major portion of the world's hydraulic fracturing operations. In December, Raymond James gave a Strong Buy rating to the oil services company. The firm believes that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is expected to profit amid a favorable macro backdrop for the oil services industry. Raymond James’ James Rollyson said in a note to investors that “a sustained period of underinvestment during an exceptionally weak macro environment coupled with rising energy transition pressures set up the current oil supply situation.” Based on this thesis, the investment firm thinks the oil services industry will enjoy free cash flow generated for a “sustained period” because limited new capacity in the industry provides for an extended period of strong margins.Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides energy, engineering and construction services and is a manufacturer of products for the energy industry. The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”8. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American oil company that is a part of the Fortune 500 list. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a high dividend stock, with an 11% yield as of January 9.

Bloomberg reporting that in mid-December, President Biden asked Yellen to remain in her post. There has been speculation that Yellen would leave her position following midterms. Yellen is likely to be a key figure in the administration, and Republicans are forced to battle over the raising debt ceiling. So Janet Yellen, Bloomberg reporting, staying in her role. Dave.- Stability, very good. Microsoft meanwhile reportedly investing a whopping $10 billion in students' favorite homework killer, ChatGPT. Let's talk about that with the reporter that broke the story, Semafor's Liz Hoffman. Liz, good to see you. Tell us what you know about this investment. And effectively, will Microsoft become the owner of ChatGPT?LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah, thanks for having me. It's good to be here. I do think the right way to think about this is an M&amp;A deal. I mean, $10 billion is just magnitudes larger than any venture-- single venture investment that we've seen. And so at the end, it's a complicated deal. We can talk a little about that, if you want. But Microsoft will end up owning about half of this company and really sees it as just an incredibly important strategic bet on the future of technology.- Liz, let's talk about the details of that deal because it is a little complicated, just in terms of how much money they're getting over the number of years, and a lot of that tied to performance.LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah. I should say, we don't know everything. We don't know what we don't know, and Microsoft has declined to comment on this. But it would be phased in over a number of years. It also might include Microsoft had done an earlier investment in OpenAI in the form of credits because the biggest cost-- I mean, really the massive amount of money that ChatGPT spends, it spends on cloud computing.Story continuesBecause every time, to your point, a student tries to get an essay written by a chat bot, or just like you and me, who have found this incredibly fun and addicting, it costs the company, like, $0.02 every time someone uses it. So they're just bleeding money in server costs. So there is some serious cash coming in. But for them, cloud credits are almost as good.And Microsoft, too, is really buying market share for its cloud business, which is the number two behind Amazon. But that's an incredibly competitive business between Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. And a lot of these big companies who have a ton of cash have actually been using it to make investments.I remember a couple of years ago, Google put a billion dollars into CME, the exchange, as part of that. They were going to move, basically, a lot of their cloud computing needs to Google. So it's strategic in a bunch of different ways fir Microsoft.- You mentioned that ChatGPT is bleeding money, in your words, on OpenAI, on ChatGPT. Is there plans to start charging for those transactions that you mentioned? I'm always surprised that I'm on there and it's not charging me. If not, what are the practical applications to begin profiting from this technology?LIZ HOFFMAN: Yeah. I mean, that's always the problem with early stage companies. At some point, they need to figure out how to monetize. These guys have done an incredibly good job winning the attention game, and so they need to figure out how to flip that switch. The answer is there's a ton of applications. I mean, first of all, Microsoft plans to use this in their software.We've made a lot of clippy jokes in the last 12 hours, but they were very early to that game. Like, I see you're trying to do this. Can I help you? OpenAI, the code is so good, it can help people figure out how to do stuff in Excel. So it can really make sort of technical software that Microsoft sells just a lot easier and more user friendly, which will help them.But I've also talked to CEOs at unrelated nontech companies who think this can be a game changer for customer service, for client relationship management, that kind of stuff. I mean, just think about how much of Twitter is just people standing in line at the airport and tweeting angrily at Delta. So there's a lot of-- there are a lot of applications.And the one we haven't talked about, obviously, is search. Microsoft's Bing has been really an afterthought to Google for a long time. Interestingly, Google is very good. If you ask it a question, it will come back very reliably with-- and point you to where you can find an answer. It's not that good at telling you the answer. It's trying to get better at that, and you'll see some of their search results are a little more kind of natural language-y, but they're kind of clunky. And so people really think this could be the future of search.- You know, Liz, I'm curious just to get your personal take on this because Morgan Stanley was out with a note last month talking about-- or, I guess, discussing more so how big of a threat ChatGPT could potentially be for Google and its search business. From what you know, from all the reporting that you've done, do you think it's going to move the needle there?LIZ HOFFMAN: I'll say two things. One is this is a little bit like we've all been promised flying cars. And here we are, and we don't have them. This does feel like the next big thing in tech, right? You had the internet in the late '90s. You had mobile in the late 2000s, and kind of nothing since then. So just at a high level, I think this is really directionally interesting.But then the verdict from the market today, I don't know exactly where they are right now, but Microsoft opened about a point up, and Google opened about a point down. And that's $35 billion of market value just swung between two tech giants. And by the way, it's not often you see investors in a company like Microsoft cheer them putting a huge amount of money into a very nascent technology at an incredibly high price point. So clearly the market thinks this is a game changer and is happy that Microsoft is getting there first.- Liz, we haven't heard anything in the way of competition. Have you? And what is stopping someone else from getting in this game? It doesn't seem like there would be a massive hurdle or barrier to entry.LIZ HOFFMAN: That's always the problem with venture, right? How deep is the moat, and how big a head start do you have. I guess it really depends on-- there's a couple of things, right? Is computing power now a commodity? Maybe. You could probably argue that it is. You've got the big players.The cost of cloud is always coming down. If you had enough time to feed the entire history of human interaction into a powerful enough computer, and you had enough money, I don't see why someone couldn't replicate this. I think that's a real concern here. That said, head starts are really helpful, and they have a very big one.- It'll be fascinating to see where this technology takes us. Liz Hoffman, always great to have you, of Semafor. Thanks so much.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US.Go back a few decades and the LGBTQ movement didn't even exist. According to many historians, the start of the modern gay rights movement took place in 1965 in Philadelphia. Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15.

Using the Zacks Rank we can identify stocks that are forecasted to have improving earnings. Companies with growing earnings in a slowing economy can provide a cushion many investors’ portfolios need.A major headwind for stocks continues to be persistent inflation. Picking stocks in commodities-based businesses can be a great way to use inflation as a tailwind. Aligning macro trends with signals from the Zacks Rank can act like a cheat code for investors.It is also worth considering that although many analysts agree the near future looks gloomy, consensus agreements can be wrong.Current data may be showing a slowing economy, but broadly speaking things are still quite robust. There is a possibility that we will have a persistently strong economy in 2023, so I also share a stock that should perform well in that case.Archer-Daniels-MidlandArcher-Daniels-Midland ADM is an international agricultural commodities company. ADM trade, transport, store, process and merchandise a wide range of raw agricultural materials. Archer-Daniels-Midland currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicating strong positive earnings revision growth.Inflation has been a boon for the commodities and raw materials industries and ADM was not excluded. Revenue and more importantly, earnings have rallied tremendously since inflation gained momentum. In the charts below we can see revenue jumped from ~$65 billion to nearly $100 billion between 2020 and 2022, and EPS more than doubled.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADM currently trades at a P/E of 11.5x, which is below both its industry average and its own 10yr median. And ADM offers a dividend yield of 1.9%, which it has continuously raised throughout the company history.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCleveland-Cliff Inc. Cleveland-Cliff, formerly Cliff Natural Resources, is a flat-rolled steel producer and the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America. Since 2019 CLF has experienced a huge boom in revenue going from just under $2 billion in 2019 to over $20 billion today, in part thanks to strategic acquisitions. CLF has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and trades at a P/E of 3.6x, which is well below the industry average of 15x, and its 10yr median of 6x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the chart below we can see that after rolling over in mid-2022, 2023 earnings trends have begun to turn higher again. This is encouraging action for the stock as Zacks research demonstrates that upwards revisions in earnings expectations strongly correlates with future price gains.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited RentalsUnited Rentals is a construction and industrial equipment rental company. URI rents out a range of different equipment including forklifts, earthmoving equipment, and scissor lifts to customers such as industrial firms, utilities, homeowners, and government entities.United Rentals is a company that would benefit from positive trends in housing, construction, and infrastructure. While many analysts are expecting these industries to slow considerably over the next year, it is very possible those analysts are wrong. Furthermore, it is hard to argue with the earnings data, and stock price.URI is nearing its all-time high stock price, and earnings revisions continue to trend higher. You can see in the chart below how consistently earnings expectations have trended higher since 2020. This is a rare sight and may indicate that there is another leg higher in the economy before things eventually roll over.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlong with the other two, URI has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) but because of its economic drivers may provide a return that is uncorrelated a commodities business like ADM.ConclusionWhether the economy will be weak or strong this year is truly unknown, but that doesn't mean you can’t find stocks that may perform well. The Zacks Rank is one tool that can provide investors with stocks that regularly outperform the market.Additionally, it is interesting to consider that the Zacks Ranks may provide some insights into what is happening in the economy. Caterpillar CAT, the well-known construction company, recently made new highs, and like URI has positively trending earnings revisions. Not something you would expect to see in a recession.While analyzing the market it can be easy to get carried away by narratives, but it’s extremely important to keep an open mind.

74,bd92eef3-5194-3fc8-923a-363af99ed403,ADM,2023-01-11,ADM (ADM) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adm-adm-upgraded-strong-buy-170005294.html,1673370005,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for ADM basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for ADM imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for ADMThis agribusiness giant is expected to earn $7.48 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2022, which represents a year-over-year change of 44.1%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for ADM. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of ADM to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock has declined 8.5% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for ADMThe RSI reading of 28.01 for ADM is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for ADMThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ADM has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ADM currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

That is because Jan 20, 2023 $38 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Archer Daniels Midland shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Archer Daniels Midland is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Agriculture - Operations industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter moved from $1.58 per share to $1.57.Given the way analysts feel about Archer Daniels Midland right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

84,e86c940b-f4cf-310d-8499-97eb3f7cf122,LUV,2023-01-11,Southwest offers $49 one-way fares following holiday flight chaos,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/southwest-offers-49-one-way-213421322.html,1673386461,VIDEO,['LUV'],"[Following thousands of cancellations over the holidays, Southwest Airlines is now offering one-way fares starting at $49.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at another big mover, and that is Southwest. Following its holiday travel disaster, Southwest Airlines trying to get back in good graces with its customers, this time, via a huge fare sale. Now the airline selling one-way tickets for as low as 49 bucks between the end of this month, January 31 through May 17.Of course, there are some rules to this. You have to book 21 days in advance. You have to buy your ticket by this Thursday at midnight. And there are blackout dates for some domestic and international travel. Southwest stock moving a bit on this news. Taking a look at the intraday move, it looks like gains of just over 1 and 1/2%.But Dave, I don't know whether or not this is going to do the trick. I think a lot of customers are fed up with Southwest. They're demanding answers. They want to see more changes. Yes, a fair sale is a step in the right direction, but those customers that have been impacted during the very important Christmas holiday time period, I'm going to think that they're going to want something more closer to free flights.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, 16,700 flights canceled in that devastating period. And quite frankly, I've been trying to search for these $49 fares. And it kind of feels like the frustration that passengers found trying to get reacquainted with their luggage. Some, by the way, still have not over the Christmas holidays. I could not find a single $49 fare.I did look 21 days out. I did look Monday through Thursday. I checked several different cities over the course of three different months. And again, I did not find one fare for 49. I found one for 54. Just about everything else in terms of a one-way route was north of 110 or $141. This appears to be, on its surface, a marketing gimmick that is certainly not going to work.What is going to solve this? It's going to take quite some time. They say it could cost them, that devastating meltdown, $825 million on their bottom line. About half of that in terms of lost revenue for all those 16,000+ canceled flights. Who is to blame here? What is to blame? That outdated computer system that was largely the fault of all this. We still haven't heard from Southwest. Is that going to be replaced?Story continuesNow a lot of the blame has gone on the current CEO, Bob Jordan, but some are starting to speak out about their former CEO, Gary Kelly, who is still, Seana, the executive chairman and some feel is still a large influence in the problems there at Southwest. Largely speaking, no, these $49 fares are not going to solve Southwest's many problems.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, there has been a lot of criticism placed on both Gary Kelly and on Bob Jordan over the last several weeks. The company has made some executive changes. They've appointed five new leaders or promoted them into new positions following the disaster that happened at the end of last month.But I don't think that's going to do the trick. Its one interesting part, though, is this stock performance during all of this. Where we are today, we're only about 3% below where we were heading into the holiday week. So the fact that we have been able, or the stock has been able to weather this maybe better than most were anticipating is something that we certainly should highlight there, with the stock closing today back above 36 bucks a share.DAVE BRIGGS: Well, if anyone out there has found a $49 fare, congratulations to you. Please let us know. Tweet us at @YahooFinance, @DaveBriggsTV. I would love to see the receipt, or at least, some form of proof that someone found one because I am striking out. But again, there's no hub for Southwest Airlines, so it's hard to even trace where those roads would be found. And no hub was part of the problem that broke down that whole system. But a long road ahead for Southwest.]"

Southwest offered a similar sale last January, with fares as low as $39 one-way.Some analysts were expecting the fare sale as part of the airline's efforts to mollify customers and deflect attention away from the recent meltdown.Southwest is under pressure from some investors to win over customers after it warned it would takea quarterly profit hitof as much as $825 million.REROUTED RIBEYESome Southwest customers remain upset.Connie Henderson, 56, of Stockton, California, had scheduled to fly to Houston, through Las Vegas, to spend Christmas with her extended family, and was traveling with a cooler filled with a $70 ribeye roast to feed everyone.After her first flight was delayed three times, the property manager rebooked for the next day, but the cooler was already en route to one location and her suitcase to another, she said. It took her three trips to the airport, over 10 hours in line, and a week of waiting to get both items returned, and the cooler was empty after she warned the airline the food would spoil.Henderson said she received two $300 vouchers for the misplaced luggage, travel points worth $300 and another 28,000 points, but still intends to ask for money to cover the extra driving, parking and other costs related to the experience.""We were going to have Christmas dinner,"" she said. ""I try not to cry, but I was so heartbroken.""]"

(NYSE:HCA), the largest operator of for-profit hospitals and related health care services in the U.S., was a top contributor for the quarter. HCA Healthcare reported third-quarter earnings that generally came in slightly above consensus estimates after removing various one-time items, and the company reiterated full-year guidance for 2022. The core business drivers are healthy, and management is executing well, in our view. Next year, the company will face around $500 million in headwinds to adjusted earnings from various non-recurring items, and volume growth looks like it will be around 1-2%, compared to the typical 2-3%, due to having to grow over this year’s higher Covid-19 volumes. We believe underlying volume trends are solid and that both acuity and payer mix are stable. Further, HCA is getting traction with payers on passing through price increases for inflation. Contract labor costs appear to be beginning to ease already, and we believe capacity constraints are likely to improve over the next couple of years. We believe these dynamics, coupled with the flow-through of higher pricing to reflect inflation, should provide tailwinds to adjusted earnings growth.”Story continuesChaikom/Shutterstock.comHCA Healthcare, Inc.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.5%.Revenues are expected to be $11.05 billion, down 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.66% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?For Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Goldman will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $7.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.25, delivering a surprise of +10.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,d56b0e3a-0d3d-334f-9683-038f265dbf35,HOLX,2023-01-11,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-hit-52-141502126.html,1673360102,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Shares of Hologic (HOLX) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 6.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $81.97 in the previous session. Hologic has gained 6.7% since the start of the year compared to the -17.7% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the -27.9% return for the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 31, 2022, Hologic reported EPS of $0.82 versus consensus estimate of $0.62.For the current fiscal year, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $3.46 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues. This represents a -42.52% change in EPS on a -21.59% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.92 per share on $4.04 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.1% and 5.98%, respectively.Valuation MetricsHologic may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Hologic has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 25.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.2X versus its peer group's average of 17.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Hologic currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Hologic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Hologic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does HOLX Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of HOLX have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is LivaNova PLC (LIVN). LIVN has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. LivaNova PLC beat our consensus estimate by 1.75%, and for the current fiscal year, LIVN is expected to post earnings of $2.46 per share on revenue of $1.01 billion.Shares of LivaNova PLC have gained 3.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 22.71X and a P/CF of 15.56X.The Medical - Instruments industry is in the top 37% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for HOLX and LIVN, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sheridan notes the dollar index is down about 7% since Netflix's most recent quarterly report.In its note, Goldman boosted estimates for average revenue per user and GAAP operating income as a result of the dollar's slide, in addition to upping its price target to $225 from $200 per share.Still, Sheridan — who remains one of the more bearish Netflix analysts on Wall Street — maintained his Sell rating, citing concerns surrounding a possible consumer recession creating a ""spin down"" risk into cheaper plans, along with increased global competition, margin expansion, and high content spend.Netflix shares closed higher by 3.9% on Tuesday to settle at $327.54.Sheridan also warned Netflix's foray into advertising could cause hiccups for the company, which had previously relied only on subscription revenue: ""We expect a host of large scaled brand advertisers will adopt the offering but its current framework (large minimum commitment, above industry pricing, and limited measurement) could cap the advertising dollar opportunity.""Overall, ""[we] view NFLX as a show-me story with a light catalyst path in the next 6-12 months on newer product initiatives,"" the analyst wrote.Netflix, up a whopping 70% over the past six months, has seen shares climb more than 10% so far in January, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite's 2% gain.Investors remain confident the platform's ad-supported tier, which launched in November, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing, will invigorate both subscriber and revenue growth in 2023.Story continuesThe stock has also been buoyed by a steady stream of successful content releases like ""Glass Onion,"" ""Troll,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""My Name is Vendetta,"" and ""Wednesday.""Netflix is set to report earnings on Jan. 19 after the market close — with Wall Street setting lofty goals for the company.

115,14d2187f-ed45-3f98-89b4-764f34452092,AMGN,2023-01-11,10 Most Fined Pharmaceutical Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-fined-pharmaceutical-companies-145811264.html,1673393411,STORY,"['LLY', 'AZN', 'NVS', 'AMGN', 'BMY']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 most fined pharmaceutical companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Fined Pharmaceutical Companies in the World.Pharmaceutical companies have often been derided by conspiracy theorists who coined the term ""Big Pharma"". The theory goes that pharmaceutical bosses get together and operate for sinister purposes rather than operating for the public good. For example, some theories believe that pharmaceutical corporations suppress natural alternative remedies so they can sell their drugs while other theories believe that drugs against HIV/Aids are ineffective on purpose. One of the more outlandish theories is that the cure for cancer has been discovered but companies have repressed it, so they get more patients and hence, higher sales. First of all, cancer isn't just one disease, it is ""a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrollable proliferation of cell"". Most people know that there are different types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, blood cancer and skin cancer among others, and each have a different method of treatment. This is why even if a cure is discovered, it will only eliminate a specific type of cancer. Also, can you imagine how much pharmaceutical companies would earn if they came up with a drug to cure any type of cancer?10 most fined pharmaceutical companies in the worldPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashAnother common argument is that pharmaceutical companies often overprice their drugs to increase revenue and profits, especially when compared to costs. One thing people should remember is that the cost of manufacturing a drug isn't the only pertinent cost; research and development for a drug can often cost billions and this cost has to be considered when setting a price. Further, in most countries around the world, especially in developed countries, prices are controlled by the government. The U.S. is a major exception to this which is why Martin Shkreli was able to increase the price of a lifesaving drug from $13.5 to $750 a pill. Of course, there is still an argument regarding overpricing as evidenced by the recent Twitter debacle for Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), when someone got a blue tick and pretended to be Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), announced that the company would offer insulin for free, which tanked its stock.Story continuesIn November, the CEO of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) made the following comment about the Twitter episode at the STAT Summit:""It probably highlights that we have more work to do to bring down the cost of insulin for more people.""Pharmaceutical companies should also be recognized for their swift response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as the firms responsible for developing vaccines were able to produce one in an unprecedented amount of time, which played a crucial role in containing the virus.However, all of the above does not mean that pharmaceutical companies are not susceptible to corruption or malpractice. As is true for any major corporation, the focus, while being on patients, is also heavily on profits and revenue as they need to provide a return to their shareholders. Famous companies which have been destroyed due to corrupt practices include Enron and WorldCom. Many pharmaceutical companies have also engaged in unethical and illegal behavior at times, which has resulted in fines worth billions of dollars. These pharmaceuticals have often received criticism for their engagement in illegal activities including kickbacks and bribes, while these also include shipping contaminated or adulterated drugs, not to mention marketing drugs for uses which had not been approved.In total, these companies were fined over $33 billion from 2003 to 2016, with the most fined pharmaceutical company in the world alone responsible for nearly $10 billion of this amount, as well as the largest single fine in history. Our data is based on a report by the Journal of the American Medical Association which carried out an assessment in the aforementioned time period. Of the 26 companies considered in the study, shockingly, only 4 companies (15%) never faced any penalties for illegal activities. Two of the companies in the list have been acquired by other companies in the past 15 years, and so we've added their fines to the companies which acquired them. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies whose fines are higher than revenues of other corporations, starting with number 10:10. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Total fines incurred by the company from 2003 to 2016 (in millions): $1,172Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the most fined pharmaceutical companies in the world, having faced 9 penalties since its operations commenced. In 2012, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) agreed to pay $762 million to resolve False Claims Act allegations which was the single largest criminal and civil False Claims Act settlement related to a biotech company in the history of the U.S.9. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Total fines incurred by the company from 2003 to 2016 (in millions): $1,172AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, which was one of the companies involved in the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has faced 10 penalties so far with the biggest one being a payment of $520 million to resolve allegations that AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) illegally market the drug Seroquel.8. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Total fines incurred by the company from 2003 to 2016 (in millions): $1,198Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a Swiss-American pharmaceutical company which was recently part of a group of companies fined more than $400 million by the French authorities. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has been the subject of 11 penalties, with penalties being just 0.18% of its total revenue. This is why even though it may seem that the amount of these fines are high, often numbering in hundreds of millions of dollars of even billions, as a proportion of even their annual revenue or profits, these fines are miniscule and a risk worth taking for most companies.7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)Total fines incurred by the company from 2003 to 2016 (in millions): $1,389Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) recorded revenues of $46 billion in 2021 alone. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is currently one of the defendants of a $1 billion lawsuit from Guatemala for its role in a 1940s U.S. experiment which led to infecting hundreds of Guatemalans with syphilis. Bristol Myers Squibb paid more than $515 million in order to resolve allegations of illegal marketing and pricing of drugs.6. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Total fines incurred by the company from 2003 to 2016 (in millions): $1,775Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American pharmaceutical company which has offices in around 18 countries. Among the many controversies Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) faced is the illegal marketing of Zyprexa, for which a penalty of $1.415 billion was imposed of which $515 million was a fine. Similarly, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was accused of illegal marketing of Evista and paid $36 million in fines.Click to continue reading the 5 most fined pharmaceutical companies in the world. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World15 Most Creative Companies in the World16 Biggest Mining Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 10 most fined pharmaceutical companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey.This article was corrected at 18:28 PM ET on January 10, 2023, to remove a statement that was mistakenly attributed to Eli Lilly's CEO.]"

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide program management, engineering development, systems integration, long lead material, and special tooling and equipment to support missile production.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Denver, Co and Sunnyvale, CA.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Notably, Lockheed’s Space business unit, apart from developing satellites and space transportation system, also builds strike missile systems. Its major programs include Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States. This missile cannot be tracked during operation as it has a sea-based deterrent.As one of the major missile makers in the United States and with such a remarkable missile in its product portfolio, Lockheed Martin enjoys a strong demand base in the missile defense market. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Growth ProspectsPer a report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.9% during the 2022-2027 period. Such an expanding market is likely to benefit LMT as it enjoys a solid position in the military missile market.

The swings on Monday and at the end of last week extend the bout of choppiness and volatility that could remain with the market for a while.   Stocks were up slightly through mid-day trading on Tuesday after Jay Powell spoke in Stockholm. The Fed boss has not wavered from his commitment to dragging down inflation since the Fed first began its tightening efforts.Powell on Tuesday reiterated the central bank’s willingness to cause economic pain in order to bring inflation down to the Fed’s 2% target range. “Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time,” Powell said in prepared remarks from a panel in Stockholm.The market surged last Friday after the Labor Department said employers added the smallest number of new jobs in roughly two years in December, with average hourly earnings up 4.6% last month vs. the 5.6% peak in March.Salesforce, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and Coinbase are some of the higher-profile companies that are set to lay off a large number of employees. Despite the highly-publicized layoffs, the December jobs data showed that some industries remain in hiring mode, with overall unemployment at a 50-year low of 3.5%.Thankfully, Wall Street will gain more clarity as to what might be next when December’s CPI data is released on Thursday, January 12. On top of that, the big banks unofficially kick off what could prove to be a pivotal fourth quarter earnings season on Friday.All of the unknowns might have some investors rushing to the sidelines. And it is certainly prudent to grow your cash pile in order to deploy if the market falls again in the coming weeks and months. But market timing is extremely difficult and many stocks managed to climb in 2022 and in recent months, especially ones that have provided upbeat bottom-line guidance.Story continuesWith this in mind, investors can utilize the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 Stock Screen to help find potentially winning stocks for January and beyond in 2023 that have boosted their earnings guidance even as the larger EPS outlook slides lower.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks outperform the market in both good and bad times. However, there are over 200 stocks that earn a Zacks Rank #1 at any given time. Therefore, it’s helpful to understand how to apply filters to the Zacks Rank in order to narrow the list down to a more manageable and tradable set of stocks.ParametersClearly, there are only three items on this screen. But together, these three filters can result in some impressive returns.• Zacks Rank equal to 1Starting with a Zacks Rank #1 is often a strong jumping off point because it boasts an average annual return of roughly 24.4% per year since 1988.• % Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.• % Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top # 5Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks.This strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt_sow_filtered zacks rank5. It can be found in the SoW (Screen of the Week) folder.Here are two of the five stocks that qualified for the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy today…NRG Energy NRGNRG Energy is a utility giant that generates electricity and provides energy solutions and natural gas to millions of customers across business and residential customers through its diverse portfolio of retail brands. NRG Energy is aiming to roll out more digital-focused efforts as electric grids, homes, and businesses grow more high-tech by the day.NRG Energy made a splash in early December when it announced that it agreed to buy Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (VVNT) for $12 per share or $2.8 billion in an all-cash deal. Wall Street showed its displeasure with NRG Energy seemingly stepping out of its lane to buy the smart home company with offerings that include security, lighting, and beyond. NRG Energy thinks the acquisition will help it prepare for a totally connected future as it brings in a company and its tech that already lives inside people’s homes.NRG’s recent selloff has it trading around 30% below its highs at roughly $32 per share. NRG is also trading at a 60% discount to its industry at 6.6X forward earnings and 50% below its own 10-year median. NRG Energy’s dividend now yields 4.4%, with a very sustainable 23% payout ratio. Plus, NRG’s earnings outlook for FY23 has surged recently.Conagra Brands, Inc. CAGConagra’s diverse portfolio of packaged foods includes Orville Redenbacher's, Marie Callender's, Hunt's, Healthy Choice, and much more. The company benefited from early coronavirus-focused stockpiling, alongside peers like General Mills (GIS). Conagra has since profited over the last year-plus as shoppers look to save money amid soaring inflation. Conagra’s CFO said recently that the firm is benefitting from a “trade down” to frozen food.CAG stock is up 20% in the last year, including 20% in the past three months alone to easily top the Food Market’s 8% run. CAG has also outpaced the S&amp;P 500 during the last three years, up 27% vs. 19%. Despite the climb, Conagra is still trading at a discount its industry and right in-line with its 10-year median at 14.9X forward earnings.The company crushed our Q2 FY23 estimates on January 5 and provided upbeat guidance, which is no easy task at the moment. Zacks estimates call for Conagra to post solid top and bottom-line growth in its current year (FY23) and fiscal 2024. And its dividend yields 3.2% at the moment to easily top its industry’s average.See the rest of the stocks on this list and start trading the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 (or any of our other strategies) in your own account.

124,bfd262ce-3f16-32a2-8693-dcef9b3a3273,NEE,2023-01-11,12 Best Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-performing-p-500-153949541.html,1673365189,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'AVGO', 'UNH', 'TMUS', 'DHR', 'NEE-PR', 'MA', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'TSLA']","[In this article, we discuss 12 best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in the last 5 years. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years. The S&amp;P 500 Index is a primary stock market benchmark for the broader market. It tracks the performance of about 500 large-cap companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Although the S&amp;P 500 ended the last trading day of 2022 with a sharp decline on the back of high inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, and accelerating concerns of a recession, it might be a good idea to look back at the historical performance of the index and see how it has fared on average. It is very rare for the S&amp;P 500 to report consecutive losses for years in a row, but when it does occur, historically the second year is more painful than the first. This means that equities could be in for greater pain in 2023 as compared to 2022. Investment advisory UBS mentioned in its 2023 outlook note: ""History shows that growth and earnings continue to deteriorate into market troughs before financial conditions ease materially.""2023 is a year to navigate the stock market carefully and be selective with portfolios. Bruce Helmer, co-founder of Wealth Enhancement Group, told CBS News on January 5 that although the economic uncertainty prevails, China is beginning to ease up on its COVID Zero policies, which suggests that there are reasons for optimism. JPMorgan expects the market to ""re-test"" the lows of 2022 in the first half of 2023, however, the stock market could rebound later in the year. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, some market experts are highlighting longer-term historical patterns to reassure investors that bear markets eventually come to an end. As per Commonwealth Financial Network’s 2023 forecast, citing data from JPMorgan Asset Management: ""Keep in mind also that from 1980 to the present, annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 were positive in 32 of 42 years despite intra-year declines averaging 14 percent.""Story continuesIn this scenario, investors should stick with stable companies that have fortress balance sheets, a loyal customer base, widespread operations, and market visibility. These factors allow such firms to survive economic volatility better than others. While investors often look to buy solid equities at a discount (see 11 Best Buy-the-Dip Stocks To Invest In), it is a good idea to watch out for stocks which have a history of positive share price gains. These stocks are likely to have positive industry dynamics behind their backs, which are underappreciated by the market, and may continue to outperform the market. Some of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in the last five years include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our Methodology We selected the 12 S&amp;P 500 constituents that have posted significant share price gains over the last five years as of January 6. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds to assess the hedge fund sentiment around these equities. The list is arranged according to the share price returns of each firm. 12 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 YearsCopyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock PhotoBest Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years12.

Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. UnitedHealth’s (NYSE:UNH) earnings were resilient. While it reported modestly down earnings in 2008, its earnings rebounded quickly to record highs in 2010 and the shares responded strongly in anticipation of this.”11. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 735-Year Share Price Gains as of January 6: 122.59%NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE) to $105 from $100 to reflect greater peer group multiples since his last update, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares.

(NYSE:NEE), up from 59 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.5 million shares worth $742 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 745-Year Share Price Gains as of January 6: 122.65%Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices worldwide.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) to $590 from $575 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Heading into 2023, the analyst expects semiconductor investor focus to shift to finding a ""bottom in both fundamentals and share prices."" He believes the latest meaningful rally in the group is premature given the potential of ongoing fundamental weakness and therefore forecasts a ""superior opportunity to become more constructive to emerge later in 2023.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was part of 74 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 66 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent position holder in the company, with over 1 million shares worth $469 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”9.

In the pandemic recession of 2020, the aggregate earnings of the portfolios we manage did not decline year-over-year, and in fact grew, albeit modestly. Looking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. During this same period, Mastercard’s (NYSE:MA) earnings almost tripled.""8. T-Mobile US, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2695-Year Share Price Gains as of January 6: 151.04%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide.

Dan Loeb’s Third Point is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.70 million shares worth $697.3 million. In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is one of the premier S&amp;P 500 stocks to monitor. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nuclear Energy Companies in the World15 Best Sin Stocks To Buy15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies Disclosure: None. 12 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Its revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to have witnessed increases on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline and higher expenses hurt results to some extent.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and met in one of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 3.7%, on average.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19, which has been revised 3.5% higher over the past seven days. The consensus estimate indicates a rise of 14.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.09.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.34 billion, implying an 8.2% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $4.14 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q4Fee Revenues: Supported by overall asset inflows in the fourth quarter, BNY Mellon is expected to have recorded an improvement in the total assets under management (AUM) balance. Thus, the related fee is likely to have increased.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.08 billion, which indicates a rise of 1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $2 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 2.5%.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $43.26 million, which suggests an 8% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $42.8 million, indicating a decline of 9%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $32.29 million, indicating 15.3% growth from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $29.8 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.6%.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $200 million, suggesting a marginal rise from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate is $198.5 million, indicating a marginal decline. The consensus mark for investment and other income of $70 million suggests a year-over-year decline of 34.6%.The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.32 billion, suggesting a marginal decline from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same is $3.19 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.5%.Management expects 2022 fee revenues to be marginally down on the assumption that equity and fixed-income values, as well as currencies, stay at the third-quarter end level.Net Interest Revenues: The overall lending scenario was decent in the fourth quarter. In addition to loan growth, there was a rise in interest rates in the quarter. The Federal Reserve continued with its ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, raising interest rates by another 125 basis points in the quarter. Thus, the policy rate reached 4.25-4.50%, the highest in the past 15 years.Thus, despite the inversion of the yield curve, BNY Mellon’s interest income is expected to have been positively impacted in the quarter, supported by loan growth and higher rates. The consensus mark for NIR for the fourth quarter is pegged at $960 million, indicating 41.8% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for NIR is $947.7 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 40%.Notably, management expects 2022 NIR to be up almost 30%, assuming interest rates to follow the forward curve, deposit run-offs to be modest and deposit betas to decline.Expenses: Because of higher litigation and restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Management expects expenses (excluding notable items) in 2022 to increase at the lower end of 5-5.5%. The company expects strong inflationary headwinds to largely offset the favorable impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar. Our estimate for fourth-quarter non-interest expenses is $3.02 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Mastercard How Quickly Is Mastercard Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Mastercard managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Mastercard shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 54% to 57% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Mastercard's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Mastercard Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$357b company like Mastercard. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$366m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Mastercard but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Mastercard To Your Watchlist?One positive for Mastercard is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

I'm fascinated by their prospects for the future—their inevitability. I also constantly wonder: how can we make this mode of travel safe? How's it possible a self-driving car could ever be safe?At CES 2023, I started to get some answers.The reality is this: autonomous vehicles are already in use, just not by consumers. In commercial and industrial settings, autonomous vehicles are thriving, said Applied EV CEO Julian Broadbent. On the commercial side, the applications for autonomous vehicles are pretty clear if you think about it in terms of the gig economy – your deliveries that are currently handled by companies like Uber (UBER) or DoorDash (DASH), could viably be handled by autonomous vehicles that would operate much as humans do. For example, Australia-based Applied EV has an autonomous grocery delivery truck, that allows consumers to schedule their deliveries, and it's already hit the road in Melbourne, Australia.Broadbent is optimistic about how grocery vehicles like this could allow consumers to get comfortable with autonomous vehicles, far before they'd ride in one or even explore having an autonomous vehicle of their own.However, it's in highly-regulated industrial settings that autonomous vehicles are possibly thriving the most. Applied EV's in on this, having produced the tech for an autonomous mining truck (pictured below).LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 05: at CES 2023 An autonomous multi-purpose vehicle is displayed at the Applied EV booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 05, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 08 and features about 3,200 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 100,000 attendees. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)So, it's no accident that Caterpillar's (CAT) autonomous mining truck also attracted lots of attention at CES. For one, it's actively being used right now. At the company's booth, you could watch real-time videos of the company's AV trucks at work in Arizona and Illinois, and even step in to pilot vehicle.The other attention-grabbing detail? These vehicles are huge. Take Caterpillar's autonomous 777 Mining Truck (pictured below), which was featured at CES and weighs in at 100 tons. (So, I'm pretty short, to be fair, but I barely made it halfway up the wheel.) Caterpillar employees on-site assured me that this was one of the ""small ones."" Some of Caterpillar's autonomous mining trucks can weigh in at 400 tons.Story continuesPeople take pictures with a fully autonomous Caterpillar Inc. 777 mining haul truck displayed at the company's booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 5, 2023. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)When it comes to safety, data is keyIf you're afraid of autonomous vehicles, particularly if you're afraid of being in one, you can rest easy for the time being. Mass market autonomy is still very far off, as these cars just don't yet have enough data about the changing environments around them to safely navigate. Consider all the information you're taking in when you're driving a car—the closed highway exit, calculating the velocity of other cars you're trying to pass. At CES, experts said that data is crucial before the AV boom comes to your neighborhood.Meanwhile, a number of companies are trying to solve that problem by investing in their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems, or ADAS. For example, former Intel unit (INTC) Mobileye's (MBLY) tech is currently embedded in 120 million vehicles that are on the road now; the company's customers include BMW, Nissan, and Volkswagen. Mobileye's tech focuses on driver assist functions, like emergency automatic parking, and use computer vision to build out a data that will, eventually, lend its vehicles to full-fledged autonomy.Similarly, Aeva (AEVA) focuses on developing its LiDAR 4D cameras that can determine the direction and velocity of objects in a car's surrounding environment. This seeks to solve a problem that's been especially noted in Teslas (TSLA), which are prone to ""phantom braking"" because they have regular cameras, which lack a good sense of depth. Some of tech space's biggest names are involved in building out ADAS capabilities, including Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alphabet-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo.So, there you have it. Though we still need far more data to build the systems that will allow for safe driverless vehicles, many companies, some here at CES, are already tacking the problem.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Our heavy, sustained investment in fundamental R&amp;D, history of standards leadership and creation, leading expertise in nearly every area of cellular, and long history of world-first prototypes and technology demonstrations is unmatched. And we've had this focus for decades, with our groundbreaking inventions at the heart of 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, and now paving the way to 6G.Given how important 5G has become, there's been a lot of interest in attempting to determine who leads in 5G invention. Of course, there are many aspects of 5G - from cutting-edge phones, to increased network deployments and new use cases - but at the heart of it all is the technology behind the 5G standard. This technology and how leadership can be measured is incredibly complex when viewed from the outside, so most attempts have taken to simply counting raw numbers of inventions declared to the 5G standard, patents, or contributions to try to guess at who leads in 5G. As we have already explained, simple counting methods like these never show the full picture and provide flawed results.So let's set the record straight.To better understand 5G leadership, it's helpful to think of 5G as the newest part of a vibrant, decades-old tree.The trunk of this 5G tree is made up of technologies that are the foundation for 5G mobile broadband. Many of these technologies played a key role in 4G (also known as LTE) and gave us the mobile streaming, high-speed downloads, and massive numbers of connections that we all take for granted today. Qualcomm's innovators were the pioneering force behind 4G's foundations, developing:Story continuesThe fundamental radio transmission technique (based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, or ""OFDM"") that 4G is built uponMultiple-access schemes that defined how phones connect to the 4G networkCarrier aggregation concepts that supercharged 4G data speeds by operating different pieces of spectrum simultaneouslyThe use of multiple-input multiple-output antenna technology frameworks called ""MIMO"" to vastly boost data rates and reliability and several others, including power control and multiplexing concepts, which themselves were rooted in our technologies that defined 3GIn 5G, Qualcomm once again played the role of technology innovation leader, contributing important new ideas and expanding on this 4G base layer. For example:Using OFDM with greater flexibility and adaptiveness to network and spectrum conditionsAdding a scalable numerology framework to be able to use the same system for everything from tiny IoT devices to cars to everything in betweenUsing millimeter wave spectrum, never utilized previously for cellular access, for lightning-fast speeds and mobilityAdvanced channel coding to further optimize how very large amounts of data can be sent over the radio waves and decoded efficiently by mobile devicesEvolving 4G's MIMO framework to ""Massive MIMO"" techniques to greatly boost coverage, data rates, and reliabilityThese Qualcomm inventions at the core of the 5G standard underpin modern cellular communications in everything from the simplest connected parking meters to your smartphone, to the world's most advanced autonomous factories. This is why we consider them to be the trunk of the 5G tree.Inventing cellular technologies at this level is incredibly difficult and requires not only deep systems-level understanding and world-leading experience to solve, but also foresight many years in advance, and a very strong pedigree in the design of previous generations of cellular standards.Looking at 5G innovations using this tree metaphor helps us understand the role and impact of different inventions that make up 5G and how technology leadership is built upon years, or even decades, of sustained innovation.The branches in the 5G tree are variations of this baseline system that allow 5G to address different segments beyond just phones - things like IoT, connected cars, satellite connectivity, smart factories, broadcast and media, virtual reality, and more. 5G is unique in that it's the first cellular generation specifically designed to enable all these different applications with a unified design over a common standard. Enabling this breadth of device types, and creating these branches of the standard for new industries, has been another core focus for Qualcomm. Our foundational inventions are at the heart of many of these branches. For example:Sidelink communication between cars that will enable better automotive safety featuresHigh-precision indoor positioning for the factories of the futureA common standard for satellite and terrestrial communications for coverage across the ~80% of the planet surface not covered by cell towersIntegration of low-power IOT use cases across a range of devicesAnd many more including adaptations of 5G for broadcasting, drones, and shared/unlicensed spectrumThe 5G tree also includes focused inventions that we can think of as leaves on the tree. These are features that improve or optimize a narrow sub-area of the technology - often unique corner cases or highly specific applications. Standing alone, these inventions provide positive impact, yet are generally less impactful to the overall system compared to the core inventions they are built upon. This is one of the key reasons why simply counting numbers of inventions in 5G doesn't paint an accurate view into technology leadership.Looking at 5G innovations using this tree metaphor helps us understand the role and impact of different inventions that make up 5G and how technology leadership is built upon years, or even decades, of sustained innovation.Simply counting the number of inventions or patents someone has in 5G is like counting the leaves on the cellular tree, and comparing them to the trunk or branches. Looking at the 5G IP landscape through this lens, we can clearly see that not all inventions or patents in 5G are equal.Deep, foundational cellular communications inventions - without which 5G fundamentally doesn't work - and broad, enabling application technologies are what give 5G its revolutionary capabilities. And often, these technologies have a strong relationship with foundational work that took place in 4G, or in some cases even in 3G. Qualcomm's vision and expertise have made 5G happen every step of the way and are built on a history of standards creation and leadership that traces back decades. Our inventions make 5G, 5G.Think of it another way: fifty $1 bills may look like a lot more than a single $100 bill, but the $100 bill is a lot more valuable. Fully appreciating innovation impact and foundationality, beyond counting leaves, enables the real picture to come through. And it is this real picture upon which Qualcomm's 5G leadership, including the most important 5G IP portfolio and the most successful licensing business in cellular, have been built.Qualcomm is unique in the mobile technology ecosystem. Our foundational inventions have been at the center of the 3G and 4G standards, and now form the heart of 5G - from the trunk upon which the system is built, to the different branches that enable 5G's diverse applications - which has resulted in us having the most important 5G IP portfolio in the industry.Our unparalleled invention leadership is further highlighted by our unmatched technology licensing success, with more than 150 5G licensing agreements signed - by far the most in the industry - and with over 18 billion licensed devices around the world using our inventions.For over three decades, Qualcomm has been, and continues to be, the indispensable invention leader in cellular.Learn more about Qualcomm's invention leadershipView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734673/Why-Qualcomm-Is-the-True-Leader-in-5G--A-Story-of-Foundational-Inventions]"

""After liftoff, RS1 experienced an anomaly and shut down prematurely,"" ABL said in a tweet.The startup's previous attempt at launch was on Monday, but pushed the launch to Tuesday due to high winds. ABL faced a series of delays due to weather and technical reasons late last year.ABL's flagship RS1 rocket, standing 88 feet or nearly 12 storeys tall, is designed to lift 2,976 pounds (1,350kg) of small satellites into orbit, and is at the center of the startup's aim to compete with a growing field of small rocket builders.ABL, founded in 2017, raised $200 million in fresh capital in an October 2021 funding round that valued the startup at $2.4 billion at the time, the company said. The funding was used to scale development of the RS1 rocket.The startup, in which Lockheed Martin Corp is an investor, is racing to make its first trek to orbit and kick off a business tailored for small satellites, such as low-Earth orbiting internet satellite constellations.Amazon.com Inc chose Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance to replace ABL's contract for its first two prototype satellite launches early this year after delays over RS1 development.The ecommerce firm's contract for at least two launches with the startup is still valid, although Amazon is unsure which satellites will use those rockets.Lockheed Martin inked a block-buy contract with ABL in 2021 for up to 58 rocket launches, a deal potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The California-based company looks to charge customers about $12 million per launch of its rocket or nearly $9,000 per kilogram for launch into low-Earth orbit.While companies such as SpaceX and Rocket Lab USA Inc operate reusable rockets and others are developing similar launch vehicles, ABL aims to rapidly produce its low-cost RS1 rocket that cannot be used more than once.

It now estimates that the variant will make up over a fourth of total cases this week.“That doesn't mean the variant will cause more or less severe disease than previous versions of COVID,” says Dr. Charles Miramonti, a senior medical director at Oak Street Health in Indianapolis, Indiana. “But it does spread more effectively than previous strains.”As talk of a winter surge looms, you may be wondering about your level of immunity and if you can evade infection by yet another strain. Now that it’s been over two years since the authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines, followed by booster rollouts, you may be confused about how many COVID shots there are out there, and whether you are protected.How many COVID shots have there been?Health officials have recommended four shots to most people, Miramonti says.Four types of COVID-19 vaccines have been made available in the U.S: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson &amp; Johnson's is a single-dose vaccine, but all others are a two-dose regimen. These doses are part of the primary, or initial, series of vaccines against the virus.Due to immunity waning over time, booster shots became available to keep people continuously protected. Pfizer and Moderna offered a booster to their m-RNA vaccines in the fall of 2021. In the fall of 2022, they also offered a bivalent booster, which specifically targets the Omicron sub-variants that have dominated the country.Johnson &amp; Johnson's original dose has since been limited to people who clinically cannot get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or for those who would otherwise forgo vaccination. If you had their single-dose vaccine, you were eligible for both boosters from Pfizer or Moderna.Story continuesNovavax, which was authorized for use in the U.S. much later than the others and isn't as commonly used, has a booster. While it's not an updated bivalent booster, it's thought to potentially offer broader protection. Its manufacturer says its original formula offers protection against several COVID strains, including Omicron BA.5, according to Yale Medicine.If you’re older and/or moderately or severely immunocompromised, you may have received up to two additional ""booster"" doses of the original vaccine, in addition to a dose of the updated Omicron vaccine this fall. People over 50 have also been eligible for an additional booster as of spring 2022.These are the three most common COVID vaccines and the number of shots associated with them The two-dose Moderna Vaccine4 shots: two shots for the primary dose, one booster which became available in the fall of 2021, and the new bivalent booster available as of September 2022Some people may have 5 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThe two-dose Pfizer Vaccine4 shots: two shots for the primary dose, one booster which became in the fall of 2021, and the new bivalent booster available as of September 2022Some people may have 5 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThe one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine3 shots: one shot for the primary dose, and two boosters from Moderna or Pfizer when they became authorized in the Fall of 2021, and then in 2022 respectively. The CDC says mixing and matching works fine for people in this category.Some people may have 4 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThere are some nuances to how many vaccines and boosters are generally available. Some people with weakened immune systems qualify for an additional dose, which works to “improve immunocompromised people’s response to their initial vaccine series,” according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.Do the boosters help against new variants? Experts explain that while new variants can be immune-evasive, getting vaccinated and boosted is the best way to stay protected from infection and getting severely ill. It's still early to say with certainty how well the vaccine will work against ""Kraken,"" derived from Omicron, but experts believe it will likely be generally as effective as other variants.It is not too late to get the bivalent booster, which will be the most effective booster against the current strains from getting severely sick, says Dr. Preeti Malani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Michigan.“The name of the game is to not get hospitalized if you’re vulnerable,” she says.For those who want a bivalent booster, you must be at least two months past your primary series. If you have recently had COVID and want to get the bivalent booster, consider delaying your appointment by three months from the onset of symptoms or a positive test.The more a variant circulates in a community, the more it can mutate and evade immunity from both vaccination and prior infection. Since getting vaccinated can help reduce the spread of the virus, getting as many people as possible vaccinated in a community minimizes the chance of new variants developing.“Updated COVID-19 boosters can help restore protection that has decreased since previous vaccination,” the CDC says.Do you need another COVID booster?There is not a new booster that is targeting ""Kraken"" as of now. Experts instead point to the low rates of vaccination and booster vaccination for the already available ones.The vast majority of children have not been vaccinated at all, per data from November from the CDC. In a survey from Morning Consult conducted in November, nearly half of U.S. adults who are vaccinated and did not receive a booster from September to November said they do not plan to get the bivalent one, many people citing that they don’t have time to get one or don’t see the point.As the variants change, vaccine fatigue and, now, booster fatigue, has set in, but remaining up-to-date on vaccines and boosters that are authorized can help you do your part in limiting the spread.“The newest boosters are still saving lives and keeping people out of the hospital,” Miramonti says. “They’re keeping secondary infections to a minimum,” adding they protect people against longer-term complications from COVID that can weaken the immune system.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

To see more such companies, go directly to Mormon Church's 5 Biggest Stock Positions.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon Church, has over $40 billion worth of stocks positions as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 via Ensign Peak Advisors, which is a Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm that manages the Church’s money as its investment fund. The Mormon Church’s huge investments in the US stock market remained a secret for several decades. In 2019, David A. Nielsen, a former employee of Ensign Peak Advisors, approached the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with a complaint, according to a 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Citing some former employees of the fund, the WSJ report at the time said that the Mormon Church’s investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, had assets worth about $80 billion to $100 billion as of 2019, which easily surpass some of the biggest funds in the world such as Harvard University’s endowment and come at par with giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund.The WSJ report also claimed that the fund was under no legal obligation to report its finances, and its employees sign lifetime confidentiality agreements. The report said that David A. Nielsen, the whistleblower who revealed the multi-billion dollar secret of the Mormon Church, was of the view that the church should be transparent about its finances.The WSJ interviewed Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak at the time, who said that the fund and its size was kept a secret because the church relies on donations and public revelations about the investment fund could possibly discourage potential donors.“Paying tithing [donations] is more of a sense of commitment than it is the church needing the money…So they never wanted to be in a position where people felt like, you know, they shouldn’t make a contribution,” Clarke reportedly said.Photo by Michael Hart on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ensign Peak Advisors’ 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 positions of the fund. A cursory look at the list shows that the Mormon Church is invested in major, blue-chip companies and also have large positions in big tech companies.

It will also reshuffle several of its leadership roles.Given the above measures, management will lay off 132 roles in the organization representing nearly 5% of the workforce. This is likely to benefit management in the long term as it expects to result in annualized savings of over $60 million. However, the company will incur around $9-$11 million in first-quarter 2023 associated with the company’s restructuring initiatives.These restructuring activities undertaken by management are likely to account for the decline in contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) service revenues. This decline was due to the loss of revenues from AstraZeneca AZN and Janssen, a Johnson &amp;Johnson JNJ subsidiary, which resulted in lower production-related work carried out at one of Emergent’s facilities, which reduced manufacturing activities.In July 2020, J&amp;J and Emergent entered into an agreement to provide CDMO services for J&amp;J’s single-shot, adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine for five years. In June 2022, the companies announced their decision to terminate the deal, citing contract breaches.Emergent had received a setback in 2020 when there was a manufacturing mishap at its Bayview facility where COVID-19 vaccine ingredients of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca reportedly got mixed and led to several faulty batches of J&amp;J’s vaccine. Emergent lost its contract for AstraZeneca’s vaccine following the mishap.Shares of Emergent have declined 74.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 17.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlongside its restructuring plans, Emergent also revised guidance for total revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/loss.Story continuesManagement slightly raised its previous guidance for full-year 2022 revenues from the range of $1.05 billion and $1.10 billion and now expects it to be between $1.10 billion and $1.12 billion.The company now expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $20-$40 million, up from $0-$30 million expected previously.Emergent also raised the lower end of the adjusted net loss. It now expects adjusted loss between $(90)-$(70) million, compared to the previous expectation of $(100)-$(70) million range.Emergent Biosolutions Inc. Price Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Healthcare Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence is set to disrupt several industries and healthcare is one of the primary industries that are expected to see the positive effects of the AI revolution. A 2022 report by Data Bridge Market Research said that the AI healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of a whopping 51.37% from 2022 to 2029 to reach a value of $175.22 billion. The report also said that the major players operating in this lucrative market include NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet, Microsoft, Medtronic, among many others.Similarly, another report published in October by MarketsandMarkets said that AI in the Medical Diagnostics market is expected to grow from $1 billion 2022 to $5.5 billion by 2027. The report said that the AI-based medical devices market is growing amid government-based initiatives and the rise in adoption of AI solutions by radiologists to reduce work load.As you will see in this article, drug discovery is the biggest area where AI is showing its effects. There are several important drug discovery startups in the world that are using artificial intelligence to come up with innovative drugs. According to a report by European Parliament, AI uses data modeling and machine learning to generate several drug combinations very quickly.  These models expand the genetic pool of drugs and help experts understand their possible outcomes. The report gives an example where researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to predict molecules' potential antimicrobial activity. The AI-based algorithm was able to process billions of molecules and also tested over 107 million, identifying eight antibacterial compounds that were structurally distant from known antibiotics. Without AI, this massive processing would take a lot of time and human effort.Photo by CDC on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed several companies that are using AI to create innovative healthcare solutions like drugs, diagnostics systems and medical devices. We also included major tech companies which are either positioned to benefit from the AI revolution in the healthcare sector or are selling their AI technologies directly to healthcare and medical companies. Not all stocks in this article are pure AI healthcare stocks. We started from the non-pure-play AI healthcare stocks to those that are directly using AI to make treatments in the sector.List of AI Healthcare Stocks13. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes it to the list of the AI healthcare stocks list because the company is investing millions in the space and letting hundreds of healthcare startups use its technologies to make progress in the domain. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has awarded 180 grants to startups so that they could access the company’s technologies and use AI to solve major problems in the healthcare sector. Some notable grantees include Novartis Foundation, SRL Diagnostics, BC Cancer, UNOS, among many others. These companies are using AI technologies, thanks to Microsoft, to solve important issues in the healthcare sector.In 2020, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it would spend $40 million to support collaborative projects leveraging artificial intelligence for medical research and discoveries.TimesSquare Capital made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software solutions worldwide. Fiscal fourth quarter results were generally in line with consensus estimates, though profits missed slightly. While its Azure cloud business continues to perform well, the personal computer market has declined with inflation having an impact. Its shares experienced a -9% selloff.”12. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the biggest companies operating in the AI-powered healthcare domain. Verily Life Sciences is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s research arm devoted to the study of life sciences. In October 2022, the company launched a new set of tools that would allow medical companies and hospitals to use Alphabet’s technology  to search through imaging metadata or develop software to quickly analyze images for diagnoses. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) mentions a whole list of its technologies in the healthcare sector that helps doctors leverage Alphabet’s AI capabilities to offer better healthcare solutions.LVS Advisory made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold our remaining shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the quarter, taking a profit. Google was a day 1 holding for the Growth Portfolio and it has performed well.18 years after its initial public offering, Google is showing signs of business maturity. During the 2008/2009 recession, Google’s business was able to power through with double digit growth. As of Q3 2022, Google’s core search business has decelerated to low single digit growth and the YouTube and display network businesses reported revenue decline. At the same time, the company’s spending is outpacing the rate of expected revenue growth. Advertising spend is cyclical and the digital advertising industry is fragmenting as many major consumer platforms are scrambling to turn on new streams of revenue (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, etc.).My best guess is that Google’s financial results could be quite disappointing, and my estimates are far below what Wall Street analysts are currently modeling. I do not make sell decisions purely based on near term results expectations as they are generally priced into the stock but my downbeat assumptions for Google come at a time when we are finding more value in other areas of the market that we would prefer to allocate to.”11. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest chip companies in the world. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s influence in the healthcare industry is expanding, thanks to its software and hardware that equip healthcare companies to further their AI abilities.

For example, its NVIDIA Clara Holoscan is used for advanced surgeries and imaging.As of the end of the third quarter, 89 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Ave Maria made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation primarily designs and sells the accelerated computer hardware and software that is indispensable for autonomous vehicle, gaming, and artificial intelligence applications. Near term uncertainty from the crypto market correction and the semiconductor cycle have weighed on shares and offered an attractive entry point for long-term investors.”10. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one of the biggest healthcare companies in the US. The company has been actively investing in AI over the past several years. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) invested in Komodo Health which runs a predictive analytics platform that helps doctors diagnose and keep track of disease progression in patients.

To see more such companies, go directly to Mormon Church's 5 Biggest Stock Positions.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon Church, has over $40 billion worth of stocks positions as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 via Ensign Peak Advisors, which is a Salt Lake City, Utah-based firm that manages the Church’s money as its investment fund. The Mormon Church’s huge investments in the US stock market remained a secret for several decades. In 2019, David A. Nielsen, a former employee of Ensign Peak Advisors, approached the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with a complaint, according to a 2020 Wall Street Journal report. Citing some former employees of the fund, the WSJ report at the time said that the Mormon Church’s investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, had assets worth about $80 billion to $100 billion as of 2019, which easily surpass some of the biggest funds in the world such as Harvard University’s endowment and come at par with giants like SoftBank’s Vision Fund.The WSJ report also claimed that the fund was under no legal obligation to report its finances, and its employees sign lifetime confidentiality agreements. The report said that David A. Nielsen, the whistleblower who revealed the multi-billion dollar secret of the Mormon Church, was of the view that the church should be transparent about its finances.The WSJ interviewed Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak at the time, who said that the fund and its size was kept a secret because the church relies on donations and public revelations about the investment fund could possibly discourage potential donors.“Paying tithing [donations] is more of a sense of commitment than it is the church needing the money…So they never wanted to be in a position where people felt like, you know, they shouldn’t make a contribution,” Clarke reportedly said.Photo by Michael Hart on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ensign Peak Advisors’ 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 positions of the fund.

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Merck (MRK)Based in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck &amp; Co. boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of its pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda has played an instrumental role in driving Merck’s steady revenue growth in the past few years. Though Keytruda may be Merck’s biggest strength and a solid reason to own the stock, it can also be argued that Merck is excessively dependent on the drug and should look for ways to diversify its product lineup.MRK sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's P/E of 14.5X, shares of Merck are trading at a forward P/E of 15.1X. MRK also has a PEG Ratio of 1.4, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 15.1X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 4.8X.Value investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $7.39 per share. MRK has an average earnings surprise of 16.1%.Story continuesInvestors should take the time to consider MRK for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings and valuation metrics, and impressive Value and VGM Style Scores.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

161,2c60e01e-15f4-3a73-bffa-696789c71f60,MOS,2023-01-11,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At $0.20,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-pay-larger-192712949.html,1673378832,STORY,['MOS'],"[The board of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.20 on the 16th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.7%, which is fairly typical for the industry. See our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, Mosaic was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 54.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 9.0%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.50 total annually to $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.8% over that duration. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. We are encouraged to see that Mosaic has grown earnings per share at 63% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Per the agreement, the companies plan to do a whole-genome sequence of approximately 35,000 DNA samples.Sequencing this set of samples is the first under Illumina and Nashville Biosciences' Alliance for Genomic Discovery (AGD). This is a multiyear agreement to accelerate therapeutic development through large-scale genomics and establish a pre-eminent clinico-genomic data set.The AGD was launched in 2022 with a target to whole-genome sequence at least 250,000 de-identified human DNA samples from VUMC's BioVU biobank over two and a half years under collaborations with multiple biopharmaceutical companies.More on the NewsIn this regard, Illumina noted that commonly the genomic data sets are drawn from people of European ancestry. This leads to a lack of diversity in genomic data. This thereby creates a gap between the scientific understanding of the underlying genetic causes of disease and hinders equitable access to precision health therapies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTo address this, the companies this time have taken the sample cohort primarily made up of DNA from African Americans. This sample set, per Illumina, underrepresents research for the clinical applications of genomics, including drug target discovery. With the latest development, this cohort is going to be the largest data set of genomes of its kind to date.Strong Prospects in the Genetic Health MarketIllumina is currently keeping pace with its goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing worldwide market with some highly competitive products in its existing portfolio and pipeline. This market is developing rapidly on a global scale, allowing the company to witness continuous growth in the number of non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) samples.Within reproductive health, consistent strength in NIPT supported revenue growth across the APJ (the Asia Pacific and Japan) region in the third quarter of 2022. Growth in the region was driven by strong demand in emerging markets, notably in India, Indonesia and Thailand and continued strength in NIPT and oncology testing.In genetic disease testing, sequencing consumable shipments grew 11% year over year in the third quarter. National health system funding for rare diseases is increasing in multiple geographies, including EMEA and China and evidence generation continues to grow.Story continuesShare Price PerformanceIn the past year, Illumina has underperformed its industry.

187,7cbcf0bd-c72f-3894-955e-10584cf94da7,WFC,2023-01-11,What’s up with Wells Fargo exiting their position as America’s top mortgage servicer and third largest originator?,The Basis Point,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-exiting-position-america-024308019.html,1673404988,STORY,"['USB', 'WFC-PD']","[This post originally appeared on The Basis Point: What’s up with Wells Fargo exiting their position as America’s top mortgage servicer and third largest originator?Wells Fargo is America’s largest mortgage servicer with a $962 billion portfolio, and third largest mortgage lender, having funded $94 billion (per IMF, through 3Q23). Yet they’re going to shrink their mortgage portfolio, cutting one key originations business, and reduce another. Here are a few quick notes on what this means.– Mortgages are very difficult: lots of employees and tech to run lots of granular processes, very labor intensive customer care nuances, capital markets risk, and regulatory pressure– So it’s no surprise a major player would reduce their footprint, especially after stiff enforcements like a $3.7b CFPB hit in December.– When you see Wells saying (in the link below) that they’re exiting their correspondent business, it means they’re closing a division that buys loans from non-Wells Fargo mortgage banks. The way it works is a smaller local mortgage company can be your mortgage lender, but they might be selling your loan to Wells when they close it. This is a huge part of the mortgage business: bigger players giving smaller players a better chance to play locally through these correspondent relationships.– Wells closing their correspondent doors will open other doors for competing correspondent players to serve independent mortgage bankers — and the consumers those smaller bankers serve — in local markets all over America.– Most consumers are unlikely to notice this.– But there is a critical niche Wells Fargo’s correspondent division filled in higher priced housing markets where the loans are bigger. They have been an outright leader in the lowest-rate jumbo mortgages for consumers since the post-2008 crisis years. They can charge less because they leave these loans on their giant $1.9 trillion balance sheet instead of selling the loans, which (greatly simplified) makes their cost of funds cheaper.Story continues– Losing this correspondent division will hit local mortgage banks in high priced markets hard, and it’ll result in two things.– First, consumers (and realtors referring consumers) in high priced markets who were used to getting competitive pricing from their local mortgage lender might notice pricing is way off starting now. This will be at least partly because of this Wells move. U.S. Bank made a similar move in December, closing a division that served local mortgage brokers in high priced markets with great jumbo rates. These two moves combined are a giant blow to nonbank loan officers who do lots of jumbo loans.– Second, this will mean that these loan officers in high priced markets who migrated to nonbank lenders and brokers during the boom years before 2022 may now migrate back to big banks so they can get competitive again on jumbo mortgages for their consumers and realtors.– But these loan officers might not migrate to Wells Fargo because Wells is also trimming their own internal retail loan officer salesforce to “focus primarily on bank customers and underserved communities.”– Wells Fargo banks one in three households so loan officers at Wells Fargo have a pretty good opportunity set even with the new changes. But for entrepreneurial loan officers who like to build and run their own books of business, Wells Fargo might not be at the top of their list … unless they’re great at or looking to get into serving underserved communities.– This is in fact a huge opportunity, and Wells spells out their minority community growth plans more in their announcement, including a key hiring note from head of home lending and diverse segments Kristy Fercho: “We also will hire additional mortgage consultants in communities of color.”– And finally, Wells plans to reduce their servicing book, which is almost $1 trillion now. In short, their servicing book going forward will align around the adjustment they made on the originations side: originations and servicing will all be primarily focused on customers they bank (rather than originations or servicing coming in from third party channels like correspondent).– This will keep Wells Fargo engaged with anyone who originates a mortgage with them, and the portfolio will end up still being pretty huge. It enables Wells to hit their goal of knowing that any loan in the portfolio was underwritten first hand by them.– There are other scale mortgage servicing players who see this Wells move to reduce their servicing book as a growth opportunity, and any servicing market share Wells will no longer go after will be absorbed happily by other players.I commend Wells Fargo for two things: making very tough decisions after reigning in the American mortgage market for an entire era, and making overt commitments to advancing racial equity in our housing system. I also predict Wells Fargo will remain a very meaningful player in U.S. mortgages long after this headline shock blows over.  Please comment (thoughtfully) below or ping me directly with questions.___ Reference:– Wells Fargo Announces Strategic Direction for Home Lending: A Smaller, Less Complex Business Focused on Bank Customers and Minority CommunitiesDO YOU LIKE MONEY?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.7%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.56%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 7.5%.Heading into today, shares of the drugmaker had lost 7.23% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's loss of 1.89% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.94% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Pfizer as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $1.09 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 0.93%.

It now estimates that the variant will make up over a fourth of total cases this week.“That doesn't mean the variant will cause more or less severe disease than previous versions of COVID,” says Dr. Charles Miramonti, a senior medical director at Oak Street Health in Indianapolis, Indiana. “But it does spread more effectively than previous strains.”As talk of a winter surge looms, you may be wondering about your level of immunity and if you can evade infection by yet another strain. Now that it’s been over two years since the authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines, followed by booster rollouts, you may be confused about how many COVID shots there are out there, and whether you are protected.How many COVID shots have there been?Health officials have recommended four shots to most people, Miramonti says.Four types of COVID-19 vaccines have been made available in the U.S: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson &amp; Johnson's is a single-dose vaccine, but all others are a two-dose regimen. These doses are part of the primary, or initial, series of vaccines against the virus.Due to immunity waning over time, booster shots became available to keep people continuously protected. Pfizer and Moderna offered a booster to their m-RNA vaccines in the fall of 2021. In the fall of 2022, they also offered a bivalent booster, which specifically targets the Omicron sub-variants that have dominated the country.Johnson &amp; Johnson's original dose has since been limited to people who clinically cannot get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or for those who would otherwise forgo vaccination. If you had their single-dose vaccine, you were eligible for both boosters from Pfizer or Moderna.Story continuesNovavax, which was authorized for use in the U.S. much later than the others and isn't as commonly used, has a booster. While it's not an updated bivalent booster, it's thought to potentially offer broader protection. Its manufacturer says its original formula offers protection against several COVID strains, including Omicron BA.5, according to Yale Medicine.If you’re older and/or moderately or severely immunocompromised, you may have received up to two additional ""booster"" doses of the original vaccine, in addition to a dose of the updated Omicron vaccine this fall. People over 50 have also been eligible for an additional booster as of spring 2022.These are the three most common COVID vaccines and the number of shots associated with them The two-dose Moderna Vaccine4 shots: two shots for the primary dose, one booster which became available in the fall of 2021, and the new bivalent booster available as of September 2022Some people may have 5 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThe two-dose Pfizer Vaccine4 shots: two shots for the primary dose, one booster which became in the fall of 2021, and the new bivalent booster available as of September 2022Some people may have 5 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThe one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine3 shots: one shot for the primary dose, and two boosters from Moderna or Pfizer when they became authorized in the Fall of 2021, and then in 2022 respectively. The CDC says mixing and matching works fine for people in this category.Some people may have 4 shots if they are over 50 or immunocompromisedThere are some nuances to how many vaccines and boosters are generally available. Some people with weakened immune systems qualify for an additional dose, which works to “improve immunocompromised people’s response to their initial vaccine series,” according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.Do the boosters help against new variants? Experts explain that while new variants can be immune-evasive, getting vaccinated and boosted is the best way to stay protected from infection and getting severely ill. It's still early to say with certainty how well the vaccine will work against ""Kraken,"" derived from Omicron, but experts believe it will likely be generally as effective as other variants.It is not too late to get the bivalent booster, which will be the most effective booster against the current strains from getting severely sick, says Dr. Preeti Malani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Michigan.“The name of the game is to not get hospitalized if you’re vulnerable,” she says.For those who want a bivalent booster, you must be at least two months past your primary series. If you have recently had COVID and want to get the bivalent booster, consider delaying your appointment by three months from the onset of symptoms or a positive test.The more a variant circulates in a community, the more it can mutate and evade immunity from both vaccination and prior infection. Since getting vaccinated can help reduce the spread of the virus, getting as many people as possible vaccinated in a community minimizes the chance of new variants developing.“Updated COVID-19 boosters can help restore protection that has decreased since previous vaccination,” the CDC says.Do you need another COVID booster?There is not a new booster that is targeting ""Kraken"" as of now. Experts instead point to the low rates of vaccination and booster vaccination for the already available ones.The vast majority of children have not been vaccinated at all, per data from November from the CDC. In a survey from Morning Consult conducted in November, nearly half of U.S. adults who are vaccinated and did not receive a booster from September to November said they do not plan to get the bivalent one, many people citing that they don’t have time to get one or don’t see the point.As the variants change, vaccine fatigue and, now, booster fatigue, has set in, but remaining up-to-date on vaccines and boosters that are authorized can help you do your part in limiting the spread.“The newest boosters are still saving lives and keeping people out of the hospital,” Miramonti says. “They’re keeping secondary infections to a minimum,” adding they protect people against longer-term complications from COVID that can weaken the immune system.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

Erck, retires on Jan 23 but will serve as an advisor for the next 15 months to support the leadership transition.Novavax’s stock has plunged 90.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 17.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research John Jacobs previously served as the CEO of Harmony Biosciences since June 2018. He previously held senior positions at Teva Pharmaceuticals.We note that Stanley Erck led the foundation for NVAX since his appointment as CEO in 2011. It was under his leadership that the company evolved from a clinical-stage organization to a commercial one.Under Stanley Erck, NVAX got its first commercial product, its COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, which is currently marketed in more than 40 countries across the world.We note that Novavax has suffered a lot recently, as the company’s stock has been down for some time now. One of the primary reasons for this was the delayed launch of the company’s protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, compared with its peers like Pfizer PFE, BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA. These companies’ vaccines dominate the COVID vaccine space.Though the vaccine was granted FDA’s authorization for emergency use for adults in July 2022, most individuals in the country have already been inoculated with an mRNA-based COVID vaccine by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Though the vaccine has also been authorized for use in adolescents and as a third/booster dose in adults, it has been severely falling behind the competition and dominance imposed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines.Compared with Novavax’s COVID vaccine, mRNA-based vaccines have high efficacy rates. The COVID-19 vaccines developed by MRNA and PFE/BNTX are presently the only COVID-19 vaccines that have received the full approval in the United States.Story continuesNovavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. This, in a way, makes NVAX vulnerable in terms of gaining a substantial market share in the targeted space.It remains to be seen how the new CEO navigates Novavax through all challenges related to the COVID-19 vaccine.Zacks RankNovavax currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Healthcare Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence is set to disrupt several industries and healthcare is one of the primary industries that are expected to see the positive effects of the AI revolution. A 2022 report by Data Bridge Market Research said that the AI healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of a whopping 51.37% from 2022 to 2029 to reach a value of $175.22 billion. The report also said that the major players operating in this lucrative market include NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet, Microsoft, Medtronic, among many others.Similarly, another report published in October by MarketsandMarkets said that AI in the Medical Diagnostics market is expected to grow from $1 billion 2022 to $5.5 billion by 2027.

There are several important drug discovery startups in the world that are using artificial intelligence to come up with innovative drugs. According to a report by European Parliament, AI uses data modeling and machine learning to generate several drug combinations very quickly.  These models expand the genetic pool of drugs and help experts understand their possible outcomes. The report gives an example where researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to predict molecules' potential antimicrobial activity. The AI-based algorithm was able to process billions of molecules and also tested over 107 million, identifying eight antibacterial compounds that were structurally distant from known antibiotics. Without AI, this massive processing would take a lot of time and human effort.Photo by CDC on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed several companies that are using AI to create innovative healthcare solutions like drugs, diagnostics systems and medical devices.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold our remaining shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the quarter, taking a profit. Google was a day 1 holding for the Growth Portfolio and it has performed well.18 years after its initial public offering, Google is showing signs of business maturity. During the 2008/2009 recession, Google’s business was able to power through with double digit growth. As of Q3 2022, Google’s core search business has decelerated to low single digit growth and the YouTube and display network businesses reported revenue decline. At the same time, the company’s spending is outpacing the rate of expected revenue growth. Advertising spend is cyclical and the digital advertising industry is fragmenting as many major consumer platforms are scrambling to turn on new streams of revenue (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, etc.).My best guess is that Google’s financial results could be quite disappointing, and my estimates are far below what Wall Street analysts are currently modeling. I do not make sell decisions purely based on near term results expectations as they are generally priced into the stock but my downbeat assumptions for Google come at a time when we are finding more value in other areas of the market that we would prefer to allocate to.”11.

(PYPL) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-paypal-holdings-140002497.html,1673359202,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.3%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.79 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $7.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.9%. The $27.53 billion and $29.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.5% and +8.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Construction which earlier matched Home Depot's performance has lately done relatively better as interest rates have pulled back a bit (down -15.1%).

The Finance sector rallied 6.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 composite index dipped 0.2% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreDFS is positioned well for progress, evident from its VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Decent Earnings Surprise HistoryDiscover Financial’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average being 5.26%.Solid Return on EquityThe return on equity of DFS was at 34.9% as of Sep 30, 2022, way higher than the industry figure of 18.5%. This reflects its efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Business TailwindsRevenues of Discover Financial continue to benefit on the back of an improved net interest income. Increased average receivables coupled with better net interest margin drives the net interest income of DFS. Management expects the payment rate to decline in the second half of 2023, which should provide an impetus to receivable growth.New account growth contributes to the loan growth of Discover Financial. Meanwhile, the non-interest income of DFS is aided by improved loan fee income and discount or interchange revenue.Solid performances of the Digital Banking and Payment Services segments also drive the top-line growth of Discover Financial.  While growing net interest income benefits the Digital Banking segment, improved transaction processing revenues stemming from higher PULSE and Diners Club volume provide an impetus to the Payment Services segment.DFS remains quite active in devising enhanced technology solutions either through using in-house resources or resorting to third-party vendors for technology services related to the cloud, telecommunications, hardware and operating systems. An advanced digital suite tends to reduce the operating costs of a company and provide respite to margins. Last year’s partnerships of Discover Financial with International Business Machines Corporation’s IBM services business IBM Consulting and vendor management platform provider TYDEi bear testament to its efforts of upgrading digital capabilities.Story continuesA strong financial position backed by growing cash reserves paves the way for DFS to undertake significant business investments and tactically deploy capital.

213,6836d878-0dfa-3311-8b89-b13339246b12,IBM,2023-01-11,15 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-lgbtq-friendly-companies-135943554.html,1673359183,STORY,"['KO', 'HAS', 'IBM', 'SBUX', 'V', 'AAL', 'ACN', 'WMT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US.Go back a few decades and the LGBTQ movement didn't even exist. According to many historians, the start of the modern gay rights movement took place in 1965 in Philadelphia. Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15. Ernst &amp; Young LLPOne of the biggest financial services firms in the world, Ernst &amp; Young LLP has published researched on how companies need to do more to be inclusive to LGBTQ communities and the ways to do that.14.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)One of the biggest software companies in the world, has consistently provided donations to LGBTQ non-profit organizations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also released an Xbox Pride controller, which you can decide whether its a capitalist twist on LGBTQ support or genuine support.12. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)One of the largest airlines in the world, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) was the first major U.S. airlines to protect LGBTQ members among its employees by including sexual orientation and gender identity in its workplace nondiscrimination policies. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) created a dedicated ""Rainbow Team"" to implement LGBTQ policies in the company in 1993 after a fax was leaked to new outlets where an employee requested changing pillows and blankets because of activists returning from a gay march in Washington.11. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Just like all other organizations in our list of the most friendly LGBTQ companies in the world, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is committed to ensuring that it provides an inclusive environment for all employees regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has faced some flack in the way it treats its employees, including being against unions.

(NYSE:WMT)The largest company in the world by revenue, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also the largest private employer in the U.S. with more than 2 million employees which is why Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) support for the LGBTQ community matters a lot. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:V)The American financial services company has been a proud support of the LGBTQ community for a while now. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has continued to emphasize its policy of inclusion and diversity with one of its policies being the creation of employee resource groups, which includes Visa Pride. Furthermore, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has also provided support to the United Nations Standards for LBGTQ, which is ""a best-practice guide for policies and practices for LGBTI employees and inclusive workplaces.

Per the Automotive News, U.S. light-vehicle sales in 2022 totaled 13.4 million units, falling to a decade low. It should be noted that the data doesn’t take into account the sales numbers of a few automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Jaguar Land Rover, which didn’t report till the last week. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for December 2022 was 13.59 million. To put it in perspective, prior to COVID, SAAR had topped 17 million vehicles for five straight years from 2015 to 2019. Amid severe supply chain snarls and tight inventories, automakers couldn’t keep up with the demand for vehicles. Parts shortages choked supplies and low stockpiles impacted sales.Below we offer a glimpse into the 2022 U.S. sales report of auto bigwigs, including General Motors GM, Ford F, Toyota TM and Honda HMC. Among these companies, General Motors was the only company to report a year-over-year increase in sales last year. GM managed to reclaim the U.S. auto sales crown from Toyota in 2022. Japan’s auto giant Toyota came in second, while Ford notched the third spot. Meanwhile, TM’s close peer HMC delivered less than a million units in the United States in 2022.While F, TM and HMC carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), GM is currently Ranked #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inside the HeadlinesGeneral Motors sold 623,261 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2022, jumping 41.4% year over year.

Meanwhile Buick deliveries in 2022 contracted 42.4% on a yearly basis.Story continuesGeneral Motors notified that it would commence the production of 2023 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups early this year. The 2024 Chevrolet Trax will be rolled out in spring with a base price of $21,495. Production of the refreshed 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD models will begin in the current quarter. To meet the soaring demand for green vehicles, the production of Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV (sales of which rose 53.5% in 2022) will be ramped up to more than 70,000 units this year.Ford sold 179,279 vehicles last month, up 3.2% year over year.

223,d554e2e9-fb1f-3d78-ab0b-3e5ce91f8929,UAL,2023-01-11,United Airlines (UAL) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-ual-earnings-expected-150003765.html,1673362803,STORY,"['UAL', 'DAL']","[The market expects United Airlines (UAL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +231.3%.Revenues are expected to be $12.25 billion, up 49.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.98% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United?For United, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United would post earnings of $2.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.81, delivering a surprise of +27.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, Delta Air Lines (DAL), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +495.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $13.05 billion, up 37.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Delta has been revised 33.9% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.57%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Delta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

224,17632b07-4aa6-37e0-a937-1c261f818e84,UAL,2023-01-11,"United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 7.6% loss over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-inc-nasdaq-135443628.html,1673358883,STORY,['UAL'],"[A look at the shareholders of United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 60% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).After a year of 7.6% losses, last week’s 17% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of United Airlines Holdings, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About United Airlines Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that United Airlines Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at United Airlines Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in United Airlines Holdings. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 5.1% of the stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of United Airlines HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$53m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 40% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over United Airlines Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand United Airlines Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - United Airlines Holdings has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

""I enjoyed the class so much that I kept coming back, and it became a second home to me.""Lewis and his grandfather were two of the first community members to use the free resources at the PNC Fairfax Connection, which marks 10 years of serving the historic Fairfax neighborhood in Cleveland.More Than Just a BankPNC established the resource center in the predominately Black neighborhood with six areas of focus - technology, health and wellness, special events, financial literacy, general education and youth programming.One of the newest youth programs focuses on robotics for middle-schoolers.""We have an amazing team of African American scientists that join us weekly to teach our younger members about robotics and other STEM-related lessons,"" says Traci Mitchell, executive director of PNC Fairfax Connection. ""It's a beautiful thing to see the students learning from scientists who look like them and watch them imagine themselves in those roles.""Mitchell says the center's mission is to provide programs and courses that help high school- and college-age members succeed, support adults in their career aspirations and provide digital and technological connectivity to all generations.""We want to connect every individual and family to services, arts and cultural programs, career opportunities and more throughout greater Cleveland,"" Mitchell explains. We want to offer a way for members of the Fairfax community to interact with the bank in a much different way that isn't transaction based. We want people to come in and get to know PNC as more than just a bank.""Story continuesThough no banking goes on at PNC Fairfax Connection, the center provides resources that help community members think about their overall financial wellness through financial education workshops, resume building, skill development and other career advancement opportunities.""The chance to build a new relationship and to invest our resources, our talent, and our time, all seems to have made an impact on the community,"" says Pat Pastore, regional president of the Cleveland market at PNC. ""All of this work has created a new level of trust and collaboration. When the community succeeds, PNC succeeds as an organization.""The Fairfax LegacyCleveland's Fairfax neighborhood, which is more than 90% Black with a population just over 5,000,1 holds a rich American history as home to notable greats such as Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens and actor Dorothy Dandridge, the first African American nominated for an Oscar. The neighborhood also was a frequent stop of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement.Karamu House, the oldest African American theater in the nation, also sits within the Fairfax community, and PNC has cultivated a strong relationship with the theater through sponsorships over the years.Though the neighborhood is a bastion of history and culture, it has seen its share of challenges. The median income for Fairfax residents is $17,456 compared to Cleveland's $32,053.2Combating Dreams DeferredPNC established Fairfax Connection with a vision to advance the hopes and dreams of everyone in Fairfax and surrounding neighborhoods - some dreams that could have been ""deferred.""As Hughes wrote in his poem ""Harlem,"" those dreams can dry up like a ""raisin in the sun."" 3""The neighborhood is historic, but I can remember when it was more prone to poverty and violence,"" Lewis says. ""As a kid, I could see the impact Fairfax Connection had on the community. And as an adult, I'm glad I can be part of the community's revitalization. We have access to free resources to help us continue our dreams.""Lewis' connection to the center remains. He currently teaches young people in the same cooking class that he began attending as a teen a decade ago.""We are proud to celebrate 10 remarkable years of positive impact within the community and surrounding areas, and we marked the occasion with a series of member events throughout 2022 that culminated with our annual celebration event. I'm glad we could show our appreciation to the community,"" says Mitchell.

228,2bb883a3-a49e-3eb2-8ce9-08bb836eaed0,BXP,2023-01-11,4 High-Yield REITs With Low Payout Ratios,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-yield-reits-low-160344596.html,1673366624,STORY,"['CHMI-PB', 'PINE', 'TWO', 'BXP']","[If there’s one thing income investors love, it’s a high-yielding dividend stock.But too often the high yield comes with risky metrics like declining revenue and earnings, which could force a company to cut its dividend to ensure it has the available funds to pay its shareholders.When investors analyze real estate investment trusts (REITs), one important factor to consider is the payout ratio on earnings per share (EPS) for mortgage REITs (mREITs), or funds from operations (FFO) on all other types of REITs. The payout ratio is derived by dividing the annual dividend by the EPS or FFO.Typically, a REIT with a payout ratio between 35% and 60% is considered ideal and safe from dividend cuts, while ratios between 60% and 75% are moderately safe, and payout ratios above 75% are considered unsafe. As a payout ratio approaches 100% of earnings, it generally portends a high risk for a dividend cut.Take a look at four REITs with high dividend yields but whose payout ratios are all considered to be within the safety range, which may keep their high-yielding dividends intact for quite a while.Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE: CHMI) is a Farmingdale, New Jersey-based mortgage REIT (mREIT) that acquires and manages a diversified portfolio of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and other types of residential mortgage assets.The annual dividend of $1.08 per share yields an unusually high 18.2% but is easily covered by forward EPS of $2.66, with a payout ratio of 40%. Its five-year dividend average is only 13.79%, which also suggests that Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment could be quite undervalued.Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE: TWO) is a St. Louis Park, Minnesota-based mortgage REIT with a similar investment model to Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp.Two Harbors Investment announced a reverse 1-for-4 stock split in November and repurchased almost 3 million shares of its preferred stock during the third quarter. Shares are up over 25% since Two Harbors Investment touched a low of $12.12 in mid-October.Story continuesThe dividend of $2.40 yields 14.9% and is well covered by forward EPS of $4.60 for a payout ratio of 52%. Its five-year dividend yield average is 12.49%.Alpine Income Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: PINE) is a Daytona Beach, Florida-based retail REIT that owns and operates 146 high-quality, net-leased properties across 35 states. Its tenants include well-known companies such as Lowe’s , Dollar Tree, Walgreens, Walmart, Advance Auto Parts and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. In the third quarter of 2022, Alpine Income Property Trust had a perfect occupancy rate of 100%.Overall, its third-quarter operating results were excellent. FFO of $0.40 was $0.03 better than the third quarter of 2021 and topped Wall Street’s view by $0.02. Revenue of $11.53 million was 41% above $8.17 million in the third quarter of 2021 and also ahead of analysts’ estimates of $10.52 million. Alpine Income Property Trust also raised its FFO guidance from a range of $1.58 to $1.63 to $1.74 to $1.76 for 2022.Alpine Income Property pays an annual dividend of $1.10 per share, yielding 5.78%, and the dividend is easily covered by forward FFO of $2.57, for a payout ratio of 42%.Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with 181 properties concentrated in the six largest cities from Boston to Seattle. The firm calls itself “the largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.”Boston Properties’ recent third-quarter operating results were markedly improved from its third quarter of 2021 and easily outperformed analysts’ expectations.Boston Properties’ annual dividend of $3.92 per share yields 5.85% and the forward FFO is $7.51, so the payout ratio is 52%.While the payout ratio is not a magic metric to predict a stock’s future performance, it usually gives income investors a clear look at the safety of the current dividend.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

The move boosts the company’s liquidity position and financial flexibility.The loan matures in May 2024 and can be prolonged by exercising one 12-month extension subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.In addition, BPLP, at its discretion, can utilize the accordion feature of the term loan facility and increase total commitments under the facility up to an additional $300 million in aggregate principal amount, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. It should be carried out in a manner such that the total principal amount does not exceed $1.5 billion.At present, the term loan bears interest at a variable rate equating to the adjusted Term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) plus 0.85% per annum.Moreover, part of the proceeds was used to repay BPLP’s $730 million term loan scheduled to mature in May 2023. This resulted in additional proceeds of nearly $466 million available for general corporate purposes.Per Mike LaBelle, EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer of BXP, “This facility enhances our already strong liquidity as we continue our strategic focus on growing BXP’s portfolio of premier workplaces, including the commencement of our two fully leased life science developments in Cambridge, MA, creating value over the long term for our clients and shareholders.”Boston Properties has been enhancing its portfolio quality through repositioning initiatives through acquisitions and the development of properties in core markets, and shedding properties in non-core markets.Also, amid strong demand from life-science tenants, it is converting numerous straight office buildings to office labs in its suburban portfolio, especially its Kendall Center project, which is one of the leading preferred locations for life-science clients in the world.Per the latest NAREIT REITworld presentation, as of Nov 10, 2022, the company had $1.6 billion of active office development (company’s share) and active life sciences development and redevelopments worth $772 million (company’s share), which seems encouraging.With added balance-sheet strength and ample financial flexibility, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. As of Sep 30, 2022, BXP had nearly $2.3 billion of liquidity.Nonetheless, a choppy office market environment is likely to soften demand for the company’s properties, hurting leasing volume in the near term.Also, elevated supply in certain markets is likely to intensify competition, limiting its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents. Rising interest rates add to the company’s woes.Boston Properties carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.Its shares have lost 7.7% over the past three months against the industry’s growth of 9%.

Let's take a look at some of the top trending stocks today. First up, we got to talk about bath Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. You're looking at a gain of the last two days of about 54%. We need to point out to just above $2 a share. The move higher today coming after the company reported worse than expected earnings, that sales drop of over 30%.Despite all that, investors seeing some optimism, I guess, in the fact that the company plans to close more stores, laying off more employees. It's hard to make sense of the recent moves that we have seen in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Dave, over the last several months, the last several years. Certainly has become a meme, a favorite.When you take a look at the performance over the last year, you're looking at losses of about 84%. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond expected to file for bankruptcy. Jerry Storch telling us earlier in the program, Dave, they don't have any other option.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it really is a question of when, not if. Closing 150 stores. There is no path to them finding their way here.And you've got to just attribute this to a meme trade. You almost want to look up ""Wall Street Bets"" on Reddit and see if that is driving the stock. Because clearly, Chapter 11 is right around the corner.SEANA SMITH: Certainly is. Right, let's take a look at another big story that we are tracking and Broadcom. That stock just about 0.3%. The move lower coming after Bloomberg reporting that Apple will be replacing Broadcom chips with its own house chip-- in-house chip in 2025. Shares initially traded off on the news. They are well off their lows of the day, as you can see on that intraday chart.Taking a look at where Apple is trading. Apple holding onto gains as we enter the final minute of trading here, Dave. Apple up just about 0.4%.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, you know, not everyone thinks this is as big a deal on Tuesday. Stacy Rasgon reiterated his outperform rating on Broadcom, saying largely this is much ado about nothing. Says that several other relationships with Apple in terms of their parts arrangement will be a much bigger deal. Stacy, an analyst for Bernstein. So says pumping the brakes a little bit on how big a problem this will be for Broadcom.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Certainly. All right, let's take a look at another mover here to the upside, and that's Royal Caribbean. You're looking at gains of nearly 3%. The move to the upside coming after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to equal weight with a price target of $50 a share. Still $8 below where it is trading today. Now, Morgan Stanley calling the company, quote, ""the superior cruise operator,"" but still highlighting the fact that the looming concerns around inflation, a slowing economy, that is a massive headwind here for the sector.Intraday jump of just about 3%. We're looking at a one-year chart. When we certainly have talked about the fact that a number of the cruise lines remain under pressure, David, the Royal Caribbean off about 26% in the last year.DAVE BRIGGS: The small sample size, the cruise stocks generally move together on one ship. And this year, that ship is moving forward. Royal Caribbean is up 21%. Norwegian's up 19% and Carnival is up 21%. So all of them moving to the upside.

AEO announced encouraging preliminary fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results.Notably, the company’s brand revenues declined 3% from the fourth quarter through Jan 7, which is at the higher end of its previously communicated view of mid-single digits. Its American Eagle brand has shown improvement and Aerie is in sync with expectations. The top line is anticipated to reflect gains of 2 percentage points from Quiet Logistics.The company’s gross margin is envisioned to be at the higher end of its earlier mentioned 32-33%, driven by lesser promotions and strong inventory management. Its quarter-end inventories are likely to be down year over year, in line with the prior view. Management also noted that it recorded the second-highest holiday sales period in its history.What Else Do You Need to Know?American Eagle has been witnessing continued momentum in the e-commerce business. The company’s mobile point-of-sale system in its North America stores is likely to expedite transaction speed and minimize wait time, particularly in peak fall and holiday selling seasons.Also, its newly-acquired Quiet Platforms partnered with Fanatics to launch same-day and next-day delivery services across 11 markets in the United States.Some other notable efforts are customer self-checkout, a new instant credit feature for returns, the expansion of its Afterpay capabilities in its mobile app, and the introduction of Shop the Look service, which allows customers to browse and shop head-to-toe looks curated by stylists.The relaunch of its loyalty program bodes well. Gains from the acquisition of Quiet Logistics also aided delivery. Such well-chalked-out efforts are likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the near term.AEO’s Aerie brand has long been serving as a key growth driver on strength in OFFLINE activewear. The Aerie brand is on track to reach the next brand milestone of $2 billion in sales, out of which it has already achieved $1 billion in revenues. The company expects revenues for the Aerie brand to reach $2.2 billion by 2023, seeing more than a 20% compound annual growth rate from fiscal 2019.AEO’s efforts to reduce expenses across store payroll, corporate expenses, professional services and advertising bode well. The move is expected to generate cost savings of $100 million on an annual basis compared with the prior target of $60 million. As a result, SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.It is also on track with its Real Power Real Growth value creation plan, which has been aiding its performance. The plan is driving profitability through real estate and inventory-optimization efforts, omni-channel and customer focus, and investments to improve the supply chain.As part of the Real Power Real Growth plan, American Eagle will continue to pursue opportunities to grow the Aerie brand through expansion into newer markets, innovation and a growing customer base. Also, it expects to undertake initiatives to deliver growth and sustained profitability for the American Eagle brand.Driven by the trends and progress on its growth plan, American Eagle raised its 2023 financial targets. The company expects to achieve an operating income of $800 million in fiscal 2023. It also expects revenues of $5.8 billion in fiscal 2023, up from the earlier mentioned $5.5 billion. The operating income is estimated to be $800 million, with the operating margin expanding to 13.5% by 2023.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 48.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 20.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, elevated freight expenses and higher gas prices are concerning.

237,de8f49be-2788-3408-bfab-3986334ce079,ROST,2023-01-11,7 Must-Buy Blue-Chip Stocks for Your January Buy List,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-must-buy-blue-chip-201347680.html,1673122427,STORY,"['ROST', 'LMT', 'MSFT', 'CVX', 'BHP', 'D']","[With many stocks discounted after a rough outing in 2022, market participants may want to concentrate on compelling blue-chip stocks to buy. The reason? Established players typically enjoy a long track record of success. Ahead of an ambiguous ecosystem (at best), large capitalization firms provide a measure of confidence.In addition, it’s much easier to conduct objective analyses on blue-chip stocks to buy. All because these companies tend to not only have revenue and earnings track records but also predictable ones, any quantitative calculations are likelier to make more sense than say assessing penny stocks. Though nothing in the market offers guarantees, companies with reliable data may command a premium.And at the end of the day, you’re dealing with well-known respected enterprises. That’s going to carry some clout heading into a variable environment. So, if you’re ready, let’s dive into the must-have blue-chip stocks to buy in Jan.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$176.56DDominion$61.87LMTLockheed Martin$473.24MSFTMicrosoft$224.93BHPBHP Group$66.04ROSTRoss Stores$121.57PYPLPayPal$76.48Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comI’m leading off this list of blue-chip stocks to buy with hydrocarbon energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Notably, the company covers all segments of the oil and natural gas value chain: upstream (exploration and production), midstream (storage and transportation), and downstream (refining and marketing).To be fair, I get the counterargument that the world pivots toward renewable energy and broadly, the electrification of mobility. Nevertheless, such paradigm-altering initiatives will take many, many years to implement. In the meantime, hydrocarbon energy sources – whether you like it or not – offer higher-than-average capacity factors. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg CVX as a moderate buy. This breaks down individually into six buys, six holds, and two sells. Also, TipRanks reports that hedge fund sentiment toward Chevron pings is “very positive.” Combined with solid profitability and strengths in the balance sheet, CVX ranks among the blue-chip stocks to buy.Story continuesDominion (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comLogically, power and energy company Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) practically sells itself on a fundamental basis. Under a bull market scenario, Dominion offers a relatively safe fallback plan because of its dividend. With a forward yield of 4.35% – which beats out the underlying sector average of 3.75% – the utility provides a platform of confidence. However, in a bear market – such as what we’re arguably in now – D stock still offers much relevance. Basically, demand for the underlying enterprise’s services will largely remain inelastic, recession or no recession.To be fair, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way for the time being. In the trailing year, Dominion shares slipped over 26% in equity value. Still, this could be a worthwhile discount. Keep in mind that the company’s gross margin stands at a sector-busting 46.5%. This stat indicates Dominion features greater flexibility in terms of pricing. Finally, since the fourth quarter of 2020, Dominion delivered decent earnings performances. Thus, it makes for an interesting idea among blue-chip stocks to buy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comWhile Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) natively carries a controversial profile because of its core defense-sector product line, if 2022 taught us anything, it’s that freedom isn’t free. Yeah, it might sound like a corny sentiment. However, because we Americans tend to feel that way, this demonstrates how fortunate we truly are.In other words, most of us were born as free men and women – and we expect to live and die as such. But we’re in the minority. If you compare the struggles that the rest of the world faced, you can see why so many are willing to lay down their lives for the sake of liberty.To be clear, analysts don’t exactly love LMT. And hedge funds have been reducing their exposure. Objectively, though, LMT pings as undervalued. Currently, the market prices shares at 21.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median pings at nearly 30 times. However, it’s the overwhelming wave of geopolitical flashpoints that should have investors concerned. If even on a cynical level, LMT ranks among the blue-chip stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comIf the subject is (insert favorite topic) to buy, chances are, I’m going to select technology juggernaut Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). So, of course, with the theme of the day being blue-chip stocks to buy, I’m obligated to mention MSFT. From relevancies in software applications to hardware (both professional and gaming) to cloud computing, Microsoft really does it all.Fundamentally, I appreciate the likely stability that MSFT will facilitate. Sure, at the moment, MSFT does rank a bit on the overvalued side against earnings (though not by much). However, look at the profitability side. Its net margin of 34.4% ranks better than 97% of the competition. Also, its return on equity of almost 43% exceeds 95% of the industry, thus reflecting an extremely high-quality business.Better yet, analysts love, love, love MSFT. Out of 28 individual ratings, only three rate it a hold with no sells. Further, the average price target stands at a lofty $288.69. Against the price at the time of writing, this forecast represents nearly 30% upside potential. And yes, hedge funds also love MSFT, with these institutional investors building up their position since Q1 2022. What else can you ask for regarding blue-chip stocks to buy?BHP (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockIf you believe in the electrification of mobility, you should consider metals and mining stalwart BHP (NYSE:BHP) as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy. And if you don’t believe this, guess what? You should still target BHP on your portfolio wish list. As I’ve probably said a bunch of times before, with BHP, you’re selling tickets to the big game.But if you load up the boat on an electric vehicle brand, do you know what you’re doing? Effectively, you’re wagering on which team will win said game. BHP produces several critical commodities, including copper and nickel. Both represent key components of EVs and/or EV batteries. Even combustion cars use plenty of copper so you fundamentally can’t go wrong with BHP. If you need some more convincing, BHP rates as objectively undervalued. Presently, the market prices shares at 5.2 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 11.9 times. On a final note, analysts peg the company as a consensus moderate buy. Thus, it’s worth looking into blue-chip stocks to buy.Ross Stores (ROST)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockFor the final two ideas for blue-chip stocks to buy, I’m going to dive into the speculative side of the spectrum. First, let’s start with off-price retailer Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), the least risky of the final two names. In the trailing year, ROST gained over 8%. Further, in the past five sessions, ROST returned stakeholders nearly 3% of market value.Now, in the past five days for the benchmark equities index, it lost 0.6%. Combined with worrisome developments in the consumer economy – particularly poor consumer sentiment and record-breaking credit-card debt – ROST presents questions. Frankly, these questions revolve around the viability of continued customer spending.However, we should also note that if workplace normalization trends materialize (as in, returning to the office), people will likely need to upgrade their wardrobes. And it seems like Wall Street realizes this narrative. Presently, analysts peg ROST as a consensus strong buy. Also, TipRanks reports that hedge fund sentiment for Ross Stores rates as positive.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), we’re in the absolute riskiest name on this list of blue-chip stocks to buy. I say that because of its market performance. In the trailing year, shares cratered badly, giving up more than 60% of equity value. However, recent sessions point to budding optimism for the embattled digital payments processing and business applications firm.During the trailing five days, PYPL skyrocketed 11.5%. Again, look back to the benchmark equities index, which very roughly lost 1% of value. You might say that something’s going on. In my opinion, that something is the gig economy.According to Industry Research, experts project that the gig economy will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 16.18% from 2022 to 2027, culminating in a sector valuation of $873 billion. Plus, with many willing to quit their jobs if forced back to the office, the gig economy could turn out to be bigger than initially projected. Here again, the market seems to recognize PayPal’s potential. Currently, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus strong buy. Also, hedge fund sentiment is very positive.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

240,6836d878-0dfa-3311-8b89-b13339246b12,V,2023-01-11,15 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-lgbtq-friendly-companies-135943554.html,1673359183,STORY,"['KO', 'HAS', 'IBM', 'SBUX', 'V', 'AAL', 'ACN', 'WMT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US.Go back a few decades and the LGBTQ movement didn't even exist. According to many historians, the start of the modern gay rights movement took place in 1965 in Philadelphia. Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)One of the biggest software companies in the world, has consistently provided donations to LGBTQ non-profit organizations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also released an Xbox Pride controller, which you can decide whether its a capitalist twist on LGBTQ support or genuine support.12. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)One of the largest airlines in the world, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) was the first major U.S. airlines to protect LGBTQ members among its employees by including sexual orientation and gender identity in its workplace nondiscrimination policies. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) created a dedicated ""Rainbow Team"" to implement LGBTQ policies in the company in 1993 after a fax was leaked to new outlets where an employee requested changing pillows and blankets because of activists returning from a gay march in Washington.11. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Just like all other organizations in our list of the most friendly LGBTQ companies in the world, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is committed to ensuring that it provides an inclusive environment for all employees regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) also provides equal benefits to same-sex couples in every country where the law allows, not to mention providing transgender health benefits in 17 countries.10. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has faced some flack in the way it treats its employees, including being against unions. However, it cannot be argued that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been involved a lot in LGBTQ rights for more than three decades.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)The largest company in the world by revenue, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also the largest private employer in the U.S. with more than 2 million employees which is why Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) support for the LGBTQ community matters a lot. Walmart Inc.

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) supports many local and international LGBTQ organizations and has scored 100% on the Human Right Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was also one of the first companies to extend public support to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)The American financial services company has been a proud support of the LGBTQ community for a while now. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has continued to emphasize its policy of inclusion and diversity with one of its policies being the creation of employee resource groups, which includes Visa Pride. Furthermore, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has also provided support to the United Nations Standards for LBGTQ, which is ""a best-practice guide for policies and practices for LGBTI employees and inclusive workplaces.

Ten-year Treasury yields ticked lower ahead of an auction of new paper later on Wednesday and the dollar was flat.Fed runes aside, the economic picture for the year ahead improved little overnight with some trepidation about the unfolding corporate earnings season also a factor this week.The World Bank almost halved its 2023 growth forecasts on Tuesday to the brink of recession for many countries - citing the impact of rising interest rates and inflation and energy problems related to Russia's war in Ukraine.It now sees global GDP growing 1.7% next year, the third worst outcome in 30 years and only eclipsed over that period by the slump in 2009 after the global banking crash and the pandemic shock in 2020. Its previous forecast from June had put 2023 growth at 3.0%.While Thursday's U.S. CPI release is expected to reinforce a picture of disinflation, there were signs of how sticky price rises can be elsewhere in the world.Australian consumer prices showed annual inflation re-accelerated to 7.3% in November, after a surprise dip to 6.9% the previous month as the cost of holiday travel and accommodation picked up.Story continuesWhile U.S. investors await fourth quarter corporate readouts from the big banks this Friday, some of the early European earnings reports were eye-catching.Shares in British insurer Direct Line crashed almost 30% after it scrapped its final dividend for 2022 following a surge in claims. Its peer Admiral also dropped 15%.The UK Christmas retail picture was better, however. JD Sports stock climbed 4.8% after the clothes and footwear retailer reported total revenue growth of more than 20% for six weeks in the run-up to Christmas. Grocer Sainsbury also raised it profit outlook due to holiday sales.Although easier energy prices and a mild winter have improved the economic picture in the euro zone somewhat, the problems remain clear. German engineering companies' orders posted a double-digit fall for a second month in a row in November, with demand from the eurozone taking a particularly sharp dive, the VDMA engineering association said on Wednesday.In corporate news, Bayer rose 2% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the giant pharmaceutical company.Hong Kong stocks rose to another six-month high on hopes of a strong economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and discounted values.Copper prices hit another 6-1/2-month high, helped by hopes of better Chinese demand for the metal and the recent dollar decline. Gold prices hit their highest since May.China introduced transit curbs for South Korean and Japanese nationals on Wednesday, in an escalating diplomatic spat over COVID-19 curbs that is marring the grand re-opening of the world's second-largest economy after three years of isolation.In banking, staff at Goldman Sachs are bracing for news on whether they will keep their jobs on Wednesday, as the U.S. investment bank begins a sweeping cost-cutting drive that could see its 49,000-strong global workforce shrink by thousands.Diaried events and data releases that may provide direction to U.S. and world markets later on Wednesday:* U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year notes(By Mike Dolan, editing by Tomasz Janowski mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

As part of a broader push by the government to meet its decarbonisation goals, India has introduced a clutch of measures to boost sales of electric vehicles (EVs).India is set to become the world's third-largest market for passenger and other light vehicles, displacing Japan, according to a forecast by S&amp;P Global Mobility.Other than lithium, copper consumption has jumped in India, even as the country produces only 10-15% of its total copper requirement.India was on track to be one of the world's fastest-growing copper markets in 2022, bucking the trend of softening demand expansion elsewhere, including top consumer China, amid a slowing global economy.

Ten-year Treasury yields ticked lower ahead of an auction of new paper later on Wednesday and the dollar was flat.Fed runes aside, the economic picture for the year ahead improved little overnight with some trepidation about the unfolding corporate earnings season also a factor this week.The World Bank almost halved its 2023 growth forecasts on Tuesday to the brink of recession for many countries - citing the impact of rising interest rates and inflation and energy problems related to Russia's war in Ukraine.It now sees global GDP growing 1.7% next year, the third worst outcome in 30 years and only eclipsed over that period by the slump in 2009 after the global banking crash and the pandemic shock in 2020. Its previous forecast from June had put 2023 growth at 3.0%.While Thursday's U.S. CPI release is expected to reinforce a picture of disinflation, there were signs of how sticky price rises can be elsewhere in the world.Australian consumer prices showed annual inflation re-accelerated to 7.3% in November, after a surprise dip to 6.9% the previous month as the cost of holiday travel and accommodation picked up.Story continuesWhile U.S. investors await fourth quarter corporate readouts from the big banks this Friday, some of the early European earnings reports were eye-catching.Shares in British insurer Direct Line crashed almost 30% after it scrapped its final dividend for 2022 following a surge in claims. Its peer Admiral also dropped 15%.The UK Christmas retail picture was better, however. JD Sports stock climbed 4.8% after the clothes and footwear retailer reported total revenue growth of more than 20% for six weeks in the run-up to Christmas. Grocer Sainsbury also raised it profit outlook due to holiday sales.Although easier energy prices and a mild winter have improved the economic picture in the euro zone somewhat, the problems remain clear. German engineering companies' orders posted a double-digit fall for a second month in a row in November, with demand from the eurozone taking a particularly sharp dive, the VDMA engineering association said on Wednesday.In corporate news, Bayer rose 2% after Bloomberg reported that activist investor Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the giant pharmaceutical company.Hong Kong stocks rose to another six-month high on hopes of a strong economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and discounted values.Copper prices hit another 6-1/2-month high, helped by hopes of better Chinese demand for the metal and the recent dollar decline. Gold prices hit their highest since May.China introduced transit curbs for South Korean and Japanese nationals on Wednesday, in an escalating diplomatic spat over COVID-19 curbs that is marring the grand re-opening of the world's second-largest economy after three years of isolation.In banking, staff at Goldman Sachs are bracing for news on whether they will keep their jobs on Wednesday, as the U.S. investment bank begins a sweeping cost-cutting drive that could see its 49,000-strong global workforce shrink by thousands.Diaried events and data releases that may provide direction to U.S. and world markets later on Wednesday: * U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year notes(By Mike Dolan, editing by Tomasz Janowski mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

Tinker said, adding this was leading investors to put small bets in markets, helping to set the more positive tone.Story continues""There is no real dominant conviction to it yet. Right now people are tilting a bit away from there's going to be a second leg,"" Tinker added.The U.S. earnings season moves into higher gear on Friday with results from big banks, such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup to offer clues on the economic outlook.CPI WATCHInvestor attention is squarely on the U.S. consumer price data on Thursday. The figures are expected to show December's headline annual inflation at 6.5%, down from 7.1% in November.Thursday's data will be crucial in determining what the Fed is likely to do with interest rates in its next meeting at the start of February.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in a speech on Tuesday, refrained from commenting on rate policy but said the Fed's independence was essential for it to battle inflation, leading U.S. stocks to end higher.""With some expectations that Powell would likely push back on easing financial conditions, equity markets celebrated the lack of any clear guidance on policy direction,"" Saxo strategists said.ING bank said business surveys point to a slowing U.S. economy and, if inflation allows, the Fed will be in a position to ease policy later this year.Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Tuesday the central bank would have to raise interest rates further to combat high inflation and that would likely lead to softer job market conditions.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3%, touching a six-month high, while Japan's Nikkei gained 1%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 0.90%.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.5%, lifted by hopes of a strong economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and discounted values of stocks.In the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar was 0.3% higher after data showed the annual pace of inflation had increased to 7.3% in November.The dollar index, which measures its performance against six major currencies, was flat at 103.26, hovering close to a seven-month low.The Japanese yen was up 0.2% at 132.5 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2148, slightly weaker on the day.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was lower at 3.563%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down at 3.6907%.The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down at 4.217%.U.S. crude was up 0.65% at $75.64 per barrel and Brent gained 0.75% to $80.68.(Reporting by Huw Jones and Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Bradley Perrett, Himani Sarkar and Tomasz Janowski)]"

I'm fascinated by their prospects for the future—their inevitability. I also constantly wonder: how can we make this mode of travel safe? How's it possible a self-driving car could ever be safe?At CES 2023, I started to get some answers.The reality is this: autonomous vehicles are already in use, just not by consumers. In commercial and industrial settings, autonomous vehicles are thriving, said Applied EV CEO Julian Broadbent. On the commercial side, the applications for autonomous vehicles are pretty clear if you think about it in terms of the gig economy – your deliveries that are currently handled by companies like Uber (UBER) or DoorDash (DASH), could viably be handled by autonomous vehicles that would operate much as humans do. For example, Australia-based Applied EV has an autonomous grocery delivery truck, that allows consumers to schedule their deliveries, and it's already hit the road in Melbourne, Australia.Broadbent is optimistic about how grocery vehicles like this could allow consumers to get comfortable with autonomous vehicles, far before they'd ride in one or even explore having an autonomous vehicle of their own.However, it's in highly-regulated industrial settings that autonomous vehicles are possibly thriving the most. Applied EV's in on this, having produced the tech for an autonomous mining truck (pictured below).LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JANUARY 05: at CES 2023 An autonomous multi-purpose vehicle is displayed at the Applied EV booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 05, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 08 and features about 3,200 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 100,000 attendees. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)So, it's no accident that Caterpillar's (CAT) autonomous mining truck also attracted lots of attention at CES. For one, it's actively being used right now. At the company's booth, you could watch real-time videos of the company's AV trucks at work in Arizona and Illinois, and even step in to pilot vehicle.The other attention-grabbing detail? These vehicles are huge. Take Caterpillar's autonomous 777 Mining Truck (pictured below), which was featured at CES and weighs in at 100 tons. (So, I'm pretty short, to be fair, but I barely made it halfway up the wheel.) Caterpillar employees on-site assured me that this was one of the ""small ones."" Some of Caterpillar's autonomous mining trucks can weigh in at 400 tons.Story continuesPeople take pictures with a fully autonomous Caterpillar Inc. 777 mining haul truck displayed at the company's booth during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 5, 2023.

FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)When it comes to safety, data is keyIf you're afraid of autonomous vehicles, particularly if you're afraid of being in one, you can rest easy for the time being. Mass market autonomy is still very far off, as these cars just don't yet have enough data about the changing environments around them to safely navigate. Consider all the information you're taking in when you're driving a car—the closed highway exit, calculating the velocity of other cars you're trying to pass. At CES, experts said that data is crucial before the AV boom comes to your neighborhood.Meanwhile, a number of companies are trying to solve that problem by investing in their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems, or ADAS. For example, former Intel unit (INTC) Mobileye's (MBLY) tech is currently embedded in 120 million vehicles that are on the road now; the company's customers include BMW, Nissan, and Volkswagen. Mobileye's tech focuses on driver assist functions, like emergency automatic parking, and use computer vision to build out a data that will, eventually, lend its vehicles to full-fledged autonomy.Similarly, Aeva (AEVA) focuses on developing its LiDAR 4D cameras that can determine the direction and velocity of objects in a car's surrounding environment. This seeks to solve a problem that's been especially noted in Teslas (TSLA), which are prone to ""phantom braking"" because they have regular cameras, which lack a good sense of depth. Some of tech space's biggest names are involved in building out ADAS capabilities, including Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Alphabet-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo.So, there you have it. Though we still need far more data to build the systems that will allow for safe driverless vehicles, many companies, some here at CES, are already tacking the problem.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The debut of Sapphire Rapids is the first step in rebuilding confidence that Intel is once again leading the computer industry forward, according to Sandra Rivera, the head of Intel’s Data Center &amp; Artificial Intelligence division.“We’ve been on this journey to regain customer trust, after several missteps, to demonstrate that our ‘do-say ratio’ is improving and we’re getting back to execution excellence,” Rivera said in an interview. “We’re feeling like we have been through a lot of the learning from the perhaps overly ambitious plans that we had on Sapphire Rapids and then the subsequent delays.”Intel’s data center business has been treading water as the industry has exploded. Its Xeon range once held more than 99% of the market in machines needed to make sense of the growing flood of data created by smartphones and the internet. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and home-grown efforts by some of Intel’s largest customers have eaten into that dominant position. The company’s ability to fight back has been eroded by delays in production technology and bringing new chips to the market. Sapphire Rapids was first announced in 2019 and its availability has been postponed at least twice.Story continuesThird-quarter sales for Intel’s data-center division — which typically contributes an outsized portion of profit — dropped 27% to $4.2 billion. AMD’s data center unit reported a revenue increase of 45% in the same period. That divergent performance helped shift 3.6 percentage points of server market share to AMD but still left Intel with a formidable 83% share, according to Mercury Research.Intel sees the new server products as part of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s ambitious plan to return the chipmaker to the forefront of the industry. Investors have balked at the cost and amount of time it will take, sending shares down 49% last year.Intel’s executives said the new Xeon with the Sapphire Rapids design include advancements in technology that will make it more flexible for customers. The processors can work in the current environment where server buyers want to combine multiple types of chips from multiple chipmakers.At least one of its competitors agrees. Nvidia Corp. has chosen the new Intel design as the processor for its DGX artificial intelligence acceleration server systems, moving away from the AMD chips it used in the previous generation.Intel was willing to work with Nvidia early, sharing test chips that helped Nvidia fine-tune the software for its own chips that go into machines that are used to train AI software.“Intel has been a great partner getting us the technology when we needed it, working with our engineering team very deeply,” said Charlie Boyle an Nvidia vice president.In addition to playing a role in high-end AI machinery such as Nvidia’s DGX, Sapphire Rapids is designed with several accelerators built in. Those allow users of less-powerful servers, such as the owners of in-house corporate data centers, to tap into the benefits of AI to analyze their data, according to Intel Vice President Lisa Spelman.Overall, the new design will help data center owners save energy by allowing some to cut down on the use of separate chips and by enabling servers to do their work more quickly.AMD made some similar claims about increased efficiency when it released its latest server design in November. And analysts such as Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt Securities and Stacy Rasgon of Sanford C. Bernstein said Intel’s competitive position will remain challenging this year. Even CEO Gelsinger has said server competition will be a “knife fight” for a while.For Rivera, Sapphire Rapids and its successors are the beginning of reversing any perception that Intel is in permanent decline.“Revenue and market share are sort of trailing indicators of the things that we did or didn’t do several years ago,” she said. “All of the leading indicators in terms of the health of the products, the ramp of the products, the introduction on time, on schedule of the coming products, I think these are all the ways that we turn probably our biggest critics into believers that we’ve got our mojo back.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirlines Resurrect Ancient Jumbo Jets to Meet First- and Business-Class DemandStarbucks’s New CEO Has Tall Orders to FillUsed-Car Prices Are Finally DroppingHousing Pain to Continue Until Economy Slows and Prices FallYoung Bankers Who Got Used to Smooth Sailing Prepare for a Storm©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years. The S&amp;P 500 Index is a primary stock market benchmark for the broader market. It tracks the performance of about 500 large-cap companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Although the S&amp;P 500 ended the last trading day of 2022 with a sharp decline on the back of high inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, and accelerating concerns of a recession, it might be a good idea to look back at the historical performance of the index and see how it has fared on average. It is very rare for the S&amp;P 500 to report consecutive losses for years in a row, but when it does occur, historically the second year is more painful than the first. This means that equities could be in for greater pain in 2023 as compared to 2022. Investment advisory UBS mentioned in its 2023 outlook note: ""History shows that growth and earnings continue to deteriorate into market troughs before financial conditions ease materially.""2023 is a year to navigate the stock market carefully and be selective with portfolios. Bruce Helmer, co-founder of Wealth Enhancement Group, told CBS News on January 5 that although the economic uncertainty prevails, China is beginning to ease up on its COVID Zero policies, which suggests that there are reasons for optimism. JPMorgan expects the market to ""re-test"" the lows of 2022 in the first half of 2023, however, the stock market could rebound later in the year. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, some market experts are highlighting longer-term historical patterns to reassure investors that bear markets eventually come to an end. As per Commonwealth Financial Network’s 2023 forecast, citing data from JPMorgan Asset Management: ""Keep in mind also that from 1980 to the present, annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 were positive in 32 of 42 years despite intra-year declines averaging 14 percent.""Story continuesIn this scenario, investors should stick with stable companies that have fortress balance sheets, a loyal customer base, widespread operations, and market visibility. These factors allow such firms to survive economic volatility better than others. While investors often look to buy solid equities at a discount (see 11 Best Buy-the-Dip Stocks To Invest In), it is a good idea to watch out for stocks which have a history of positive share price gains. These stocks are likely to have positive industry dynamics behind their backs, which are underappreciated by the market, and may continue to outperform the market.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nuclear Energy Companies in the World15 Best Sin Stocks To Buy15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies Disclosure: None. 12 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Healthcare Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence is set to disrupt several industries and healthcare is one of the primary industries that are expected to see the positive effects of the AI revolution. A 2022 report by Data Bridge Market Research said that the AI healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of a whopping 51.37% from 2022 to 2029 to reach a value of $175.22 billion. The report also said that the major players operating in this lucrative market include NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet, Microsoft, Medtronic, among many others.Similarly, another report published in October by MarketsandMarkets said that AI in the Medical Diagnostics market is expected to grow from $1 billion 2022 to $5.5 billion by 2027. The report said that the AI-based medical devices market is growing amid government-based initiatives and the rise in adoption of AI solutions by radiologists to reduce work load.As you will see in this article, drug discovery is the biggest area where AI is showing its effects. There are several important drug discovery startups in the world that are using artificial intelligence to come up with innovative drugs. According to a report by European Parliament, AI uses data modeling and machine learning to generate several drug combinations very quickly.  These models expand the genetic pool of drugs and help experts understand their possible outcomes. The report gives an example where researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to predict molecules' potential antimicrobial activity. The AI-based algorithm was able to process billions of molecules and also tested over 107 million, identifying eight antibacterial compounds that were structurally distant from known antibiotics. Without AI, this massive processing would take a lot of time and human effort.Photo by CDC on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed several companies that are using AI to create innovative healthcare solutions like drugs, diagnostics systems and medical devices. We also included major tech companies which are either positioned to benefit from the AI revolution in the healthcare sector or are selling their AI technologies directly to healthcare and medical companies. Not all stocks in this article are pure AI healthcare stocks. We started from the non-pure-play AI healthcare stocks to those that are directly using AI to make treatments in the sector.List of AI Healthcare Stocks13. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes it to the list of the AI healthcare stocks list because the company is investing millions in the space and letting hundreds of healthcare startups use its technologies to make progress in the domain. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has awarded 180 grants to startups so that they could access the company’s technologies and use AI to solve major problems in the healthcare sector. Some notable grantees include Novartis Foundation, SRL Diagnostics, BC Cancer, UNOS, among many others. These companies are using AI technologies, thanks to Microsoft, to solve important issues in the healthcare sector.In 2020, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it would spend $40 million to support collaborative projects leveraging artificial intelligence for medical research and discoveries.TimesSquare Capital made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software solutions worldwide. Fiscal fourth quarter results were generally in line with consensus estimates, though profits missed slightly. While its Azure cloud business continues to perform well, the personal computer market has declined with inflation having an impact. Its shares experienced a -9% selloff.”12. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the biggest companies operating in the AI-powered healthcare domain. Verily Life Sciences is Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold our remaining shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the quarter, taking a profit. Google was a day 1 holding for the Growth Portfolio and it has performed well.18 years after its initial public offering, Google is showing signs of business maturity. During the 2008/2009 recession, Google’s business was able to power through with double digit growth. As of Q3 2022, Google’s core search business has decelerated to low single digit growth and the YouTube and display network businesses reported revenue decline. At the same time, the company’s spending is outpacing the rate of expected revenue growth. Advertising spend is cyclical and the digital advertising industry is fragmenting as many major consumer platforms are scrambling to turn on new streams of revenue (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, etc.).My best guess is that Google’s financial results could be quite disappointing, and my estimates are far below what Wall Street analysts are currently modeling. I do not make sell decisions purely based on near term results expectations as they are generally priced into the stock but my downbeat assumptions for Google come at a time when we are finding more value in other areas of the market that we would prefer to allocate to.”11. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest chip companies in the world.

However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as DCP Midstream Partners, Herc Holdings, MRC Global and McKesson are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesHere are our four picks of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen:DCP Midstream Partners is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model.

261,236a8f4c-3d39-34ae-8639-dc76da5a44a9,MCK,2023-01-11,List of AI Healthcare Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/list-ai-healthcare-stocks-145910545.html,1673362750,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'MSFT', 'PFE', 'MDT', 'MCK', 'LNTH', 'BAI.AS']","[In this article, we will take a look at our list of AI healthcare stocks. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Healthcare Stocks To Buy.Artificial Intelligence is set to disrupt several industries and healthcare is one of the primary industries that are expected to see the positive effects of the AI revolution. A 2022 report by Data Bridge Market Research said that the AI healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of a whopping 51.37% from 2022 to 2029 to reach a value of $175.22 billion. The report also said that the major players operating in this lucrative market include NVIDIA Corporation, Alphabet, Microsoft, Medtronic, among many others.Similarly, another report published in October by MarketsandMarkets said that AI in the Medical Diagnostics market is expected to grow from $1 billion 2022 to $5.5 billion by 2027. The report said that the AI-based medical devices market is growing amid government-based initiatives and the rise in adoption of AI solutions by radiologists to reduce work load.As you will see in this article, drug discovery is the biggest area where AI is showing its effects. There are several important drug discovery startups in the world that are using artificial intelligence to come up with innovative drugs. According to a report by European Parliament, AI uses data modeling and machine learning to generate several drug combinations very quickly.  These models expand the genetic pool of drugs and help experts understand their possible outcomes. The report gives an example where researchers trained a deep learning algorithm to predict molecules' potential antimicrobial activity. The AI-based algorithm was able to process billions of molecules and also tested over 107 million, identifying eight antibacterial compounds that were structurally distant from known antibiotics. Without AI, this massive processing would take a lot of time and human effort.Photo by CDC on UnsplashStory continuesOur MethodologyFor this article we first listed several companies that are using AI to create innovative healthcare solutions like drugs, diagnostics systems and medical devices. We also included major tech companies which are either positioned to benefit from the AI revolution in the healthcare sector or are selling their AI technologies directly to healthcare and medical companies. Not all stocks in this article are pure AI healthcare stocks. We started from the non-pure-play AI healthcare stocks to those that are directly using AI to make treatments in the sector.List of AI Healthcare Stocks13. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes it to the list of the AI healthcare stocks list because the company is investing millions in the space and letting hundreds of healthcare startups use its technologies to make progress in the domain. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has awarded 180 grants to startups so that they could access the company’s technologies and use AI to solve major problems in the healthcare sector. Some notable grantees include Novartis Foundation, SRL Diagnostics, BC Cancer, UNOS, among many others. These companies are using AI technologies, thanks to Microsoft, to solve important issues in the healthcare sector.In 2020, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it would spend $40 million to support collaborative projects leveraging artificial intelligence for medical research and discoveries.TimesSquare Capital made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software solutions worldwide. Fiscal fourth quarter results were generally in line with consensus estimates, though profits missed slightly. While its Azure cloud business continues to perform well, the personal computer market has declined with inflation having an impact. Its shares experienced a -9% selloff.”12. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the biggest companies operating in the AI-powered healthcare domain. Verily Life Sciences is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s research arm devoted to the study of life sciences. In October 2022, the company launched a new set of tools that would allow medical companies and hospitals to use Alphabet’s technology  to search through imaging metadata or develop software to quickly analyze images for diagnoses. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) mentions a whole list of its technologies in the healthcare sector that helps doctors leverage Alphabet’s AI capabilities to offer better healthcare solutions.LVS Advisory made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold our remaining shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the quarter, taking a profit. Google was a day 1 holding for the Growth Portfolio and it has performed well.18 years after its initial public offering, Google is showing signs of business maturity. During the 2008/2009 recession, Google’s business was able to power through with double digit growth. As of Q3 2022, Google’s core search business has decelerated to low single digit growth and the YouTube and display network businesses reported revenue decline. At the same time, the company’s spending is outpacing the rate of expected revenue growth. Advertising spend is cyclical and the digital advertising industry is fragmenting as many major consumer platforms are scrambling to turn on new streams of revenue (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, etc.).My best guess is that Google’s financial results could be quite disappointing, and my estimates are far below what Wall Street analysts are currently modeling. I do not make sell decisions purely based on near term results expectations as they are generally priced into the stock but my downbeat assumptions for Google come at a time when we are finding more value in other areas of the market that we would prefer to allocate to.”11. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest chip companies in the world. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s influence in the healthcare industry is expanding, thanks to its software and hardware that equip healthcare companies to further their AI abilities. For example, Nvidia’s MONAI (Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence) is being deployed by major healthcare providers. The open-source platform benefits healthcare companies in medical research, imaging and deep learning.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also sells several hardware devices to the medical and healthcare industry. For example, its NVIDIA Clara Holoscan is used for advanced surgeries and imaging.As of the end of the third quarter, 89 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Ave Maria made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corporation primarily designs and sells the accelerated computer hardware and software that is indispensable for autonomous vehicle, gaming, and artificial intelligence applications. Near term uncertainty from the crypto market correction and the semiconductor cycle have weighed on shares and offered an attractive entry point for long-term investors.”10. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one of the biggest healthcare companies in the US. The company has been actively investing in AI over the past several years. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) invested in Komodo Health which runs a predictive analytics platform that helps doctors diagnose and keep track of disease progression in patients.

262,724733c8-6944-3315-afd6-75d3b762fcaa,MCK,2023-01-11,4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week High That Can Scale Higher,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-trading-near-52-123312431.html,1673353992,STORY,"['DCP', 'MCK', 'HRI', 'MRC']","[Investors generally consider a 52-week high as a good criterion to determine an entry or exit point for a given stock. However, stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as DCP Midstream Partners DCP, Herc Holdings HRI, MRC Global MRC and McKesson MCK are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.Overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects, and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Story continuesCurrent Price/52 Week High &gt;= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1 or 2No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our four picks of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen:DCP Midstream Partners is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. Its massive network of almost 57,000 miles of pipeline infrastructure provides clients with intricate connectivity. DCP Midstream generates stable fee-based revenues, banking on its pipeline assets.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate MCK’s 2022 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $24.79 per share in the past 30 days.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is Chubb Limited (CB). CB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 13.28 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 25.90. Over the last 12 months, CB's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.31 and as low as 10.42, with a median of 12.73.Investors should also note that CB holds a PEG ratio of 1.33. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CB's industry has an average PEG of 2.42 right now. Within the past year, CB's PEG has been as high as 1.63 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.27.If you're looking for another solid Insurance - Property and Casualty value stock, take a look at The Travelers Companies (TRV). TRV is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of The Travelers Companies currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 13.18, and its PEG ratio is 2.40. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 25.90 and 2.42.Story continuesTRV's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.22 and as low as 10.46, with a median of 12.61.

And she has a piece of advice for rich people to follow her lead by ditching their private planes and just flying commercial instead with a comfy business class ticket.Abigail Disney, a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist, is also well-known for her social activism, including her takedowns of generational wealth, charitable support for women leaders, and even criticisms of the media empire founded by her great-uncle Walt Disney (although she is still a shareholder).The latest subject of Abigail Disney’s attention is one that many social and environmental activists targeted relentlessly last year: rich people flying private jets.“Private jets are a cancer. I’m sorry, and I know and love lots of people who ride around in them,” Disney wrote in a Twitter post Sunday, adding that while she understood that some very wealthy people fly private because of concerns for their privacy, they could also fly business class on a commercial flight instead.“I also occasionally fly biz class, and I fail to see what is so hard about that,” she wrote.Celebrities and public figures including Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift, Elon Musk, and Drake were targeted by online sleuths last year who set up groups on the internet dedicated to tracking down their private jets’ movements and emissions. By one estimate, during the first seven months of 2022 celebrities emitted 480 times more greenhouse gas with their plane flights alone than the average person generates over an entire year.Disney, writing from a business class seat as she traveled back home from Rome, urged wealthy private jet owners to think about what they could do to alleviate the climate crisis enveloping the planet and “come fly with the rest of us,” saying behavioral changes from celebrities and public figures would be “tantamount to thousands, even hundreds of thousands” of other people making adjustments.Story continuesThe media heiress has recently taken climate issues to heart, penning a CNN op-ed in November criticizing billionaires for their extravagant and climate-costly habits while citing recent Oxfam research that found the investments of the world’s 125 richest people generated a million times more emissions than the average person sitting in the bottom 90% of global wealth.Disney has for years used her position and her name to urge the wealthiest strata of society to behave more conscientiously. In 2019, she called Disney CEO Bob Iger’s $65.6 million salary “insane” for being hundreds of times larger than that of the average Disney employee. In 2019, during an interview with The Cut, she said she has donated around $70 million of her personal wealth since she turned 21. During the same interview, she said she would support “a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality.”Disney’s opposition to standards of generational wealth was encapsulated in another 2019 interview, with the Financial Times, where she said she aspired to become a “traitor to her class,” while disclosing her net worth of around $120 million.Disney’s advice to billionaires to fly commercially instead of private came with a caveat, as flying business class takes up more space on a plane and leads to higher individual emissions than flying coach. A 2010 analysis from the Guardian found that on an average long-haul British Airways flight, emissions more than tripled between economy and business class passengers. A 2013 World Bank study found that booking an economy class ticket is the most environmentally friendly option to fly, while first class tickets generate seven times as many emissions.Disney admitted in her Twitter post that she does feel guilty for flying business instead of coach, and pledged to start the new year by taking up the most environmentally friendly flying option there is: staying at home.“For 2023 I’m cutting back on all of it,” she wrote, adding that she will log on to more meetings virtually and travel by train where possible. “I’m weighing every trip against my personal cost/social benefit measure, from here on out.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

ComEd 2030 identifies key trends and priorities for how ComEd will meet customers’ quickly changing needs and expectations for the rest of this decade and beyond.""The ComEd electric grid will need to work in new ways to enable millions of electric vehicles hitting the roads and plugging in. Customers will need easy ways to connect the many thousands of clean distributed energy resources that are coming online, such as wind and solar power and battery storage. And ComEd’s service must remain highly reliable and resilient for customers as climate change challenges us with more severe weather events,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones.ComEd 2030 sets out a vision of how the company’s investments in its infrastructure and customer programs can advance critical policy goals, including the goals of the landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which aims to decarbonize the state’s power sector by 2045. And it is consistent with the formal Grid Plan for the years 2023 through 2027 that ComEd will present to the Illinois Commerce Commission in January 2023.ComEd 2030 PrioritiesComEd 2030 introduces five pillars that will guide ComEd’s work for customers and communities:Carbon-free: ComEd expects its grid will be capable of delivering 100%, 24/7 carbon-free power in northern Illinois that will enable increasingly electrified transportation, building and industrial sectors. In support, ComEd has set a 2030 target of being able to support up to 1.8 million electric vehicles on the road in northern Illinois.Flexibility and resilience: ComEd will adapt to and help mitigate the impacts of climate change and other threats by making its infrastructure stronger, more dynamic and capable of withstanding increasing weather and security risks through careful planning and investments.Efficiency and affordability: ComEd will provide service that is more reliable at the lowest practical cost to its customers by using technology that optimizes operations and efficiency and minimizes costs.Empowerment and equity: ComEd’s service will be a catalyst for positive community outcomes, innovation and job creation across the region and especially in historically under-resourced communities. To support this pillar, ComEd has set a 2030 target of helping customers access up to $1 billion of cumulative energy assistance.Simple and intuitive energy choices: ComEd will enable its customers to make cleaner energy choices easily and intuitively, bringing confidence and security into low-carbon energy transactions. Under this pillar, ComEd has set a 2030 target of safely and reliably integrating distributed clean energy resources serving approximately 400,000 customers.Story continuesComEd 2030 is centered on the more than 9 million people who call the company’s northern Illinois service territory home, and consistent with the CEJA law, focuses on ensuring that under-resourced communities are prioritized in the region’s clean energy transition.""Most important is our commitment to make sure the benefits of the digital and decarbonized energy future flow equitably to communities with the greatest need,"" Quiniones said. ""ComEd is one of the very few entities in the region that serves everyone. Because we are a company that operates in the public trust, we have a very special focus on community well-being, justice and opportunity for all.""Harnessing Customer and Industry TrendsComEd 2030 identifies five key trends for the changing customer needs ComEd will need to meet and its opportunities to provide more value for all of the communities it serves:Entire sectors of the economy – including transportation, buildings and industry – are electrifying to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and carbon emissions that contribute to climate change and localized air pollution that threatens public health.Renewable energy such as solar and wind, as well as innovations like battery storage, are expanding rapidly and require a more decentralized approach to supplying and managing the flow of power.Volatile weather driven by climate change and other external forces present risks to the continued reliability and resilience of the electric grid.Technology is enabling customers to become more sophisticated energy consumers.Technology is enabling electric companies to become better operators.In addition to being consistent with ComEd’s 2023-2027 Grid Plan, ComEd 2030 is also coordinated with parent company Exelon’s ""Path to Clean,"" which sets goals to reduce operations-driven emissions across the company’s businesses by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero operations by 2050. In addition to reducing company emissions, Path to Clean is focused on supporting customers and communities in reaching their clean energy and emissions reduction goals.A Position of StrengthComEd 2030 builds on significant performance improvements ComEd has made in the last decade to deliver safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy to the more than 9 million people who call northern Illinois home.""To prepare for the digital and decarbonized future, ComEd has important work ahead,"" Quiniones said. ""But we start from a position of strength. In the last decade, we have transformed our network into a modern grid. The value delivered to our customers and communities has been substantial.""ComEd 2030 outlines those areas of improved performance that ComEd will build on, including:Reliability. ComEd customers experienced fewer power outages than customers of any comparable U.S. electric company for a fifth year in a row in 2021, according to a company analysis of 25 peer companies with 1 million or more customers. And, when outages did occur, service to ComEd’s customers was restored as fast or faster than customers of other comparable utilities.Value. ComEd customers’ bills have remained low compared to others’. The average monthly ComEd residential bill in fourth quarter 2022 was lower than the statewide average in 47 out of 50 U.S. states in 2021, based on U.S. Energy Information Administration data. In addition, ComEd has saved customers more than $7 billion on their bills since 2008 by providing tools, discounts and incentives that help them manage their energy use.Clean energy. There’s enough carbon-free power in ComEd’s region today to meet all of its customers’ demand for electricity 94% of the time year-round. ComEd also has connected to its grid over 330 megawatts (MW) of rooftop solar across northern Illinois, in addition to other renewables such as community solar projects and wind energy, and CEJA is expected to drive significant further growth in renewables in the region.Customer satisfaction. ComEd’s customer satisfaction increased 25% from 2011 to 2021 as measured by JD Power, and it continues to increase. This is due to strides in reliability and value, as well as significant investments in customer tools and capabilities.Read the full ComEd story here.About ComEdComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

RIG recently reported that five of its drilling units received contract awards or extensions, adding approximately $488 million to firm backlog. Investors should know that incremental backlog is important since it will affect the offshore driller’s sales, earnings and future cash flows.  Firstly, the ultra-deepwater drillship Invictus was awarded an estimated 100-day contract extension in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with an independent operator. The projected contract backlog is approximately $43 million. The three-well contract is likely to start straightaway once the rig’s existing gig ends.Transocean also announced that it has secured a contract extension for the Barents’ harsh environment semi-submersible. Per the company, the new, one-well, 110-day contract adds approximately $34 million in backlog and is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2023 in the U.K. North Sea with a leading energy company.  Then there is the harsh environment semi-submersible Paul B. Loyd, Jr., which had an option exercised by Harbour Energy on its U.K. North Sea contract. The incremental contribution to backlog from this eight plug and abandonment contract is an estimated $48 million. Following the 275-day addition, the contract will now finish in the third quarter of 2024.    Transocean, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, further informed that the backlog has been topped up by certain previously disclosed options in Norway. Amounting to some $331 million, the tenure of the extensions is 773 days. The unit in question is Transocean Norge and the contracts are with Wintershall DEA and OMV.Finally, ultra-deepwater semi-submersible Development Driller III got a one-well contract extension in Suriname. The additional time period is 90 days and it will increase backlog by $32 million.Other Energy PicksApart from RIG, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like Murphy USA MUSA, Helmerich &amp; Payne HP and Oceaneering International OII.

It also features a virtual network assistant that provides a conversational AI interface, known as Marvis, to better address troubleshooting workflows, answer product or feature-specific questions and provide network-related information.The simplified network traffic management from Juniper and its global partner NEC eradicates the complexity associated with multiple networks and delivers optimal bandwidth utilization. With the latest routing platforms, the company aims to significantly improve the network for more agile service delivery and better security features for enhanced visibility and customer data protection. This is expected to provide a shorter time-to-market for new services while ensuring regulatory compliance and data security.Segment routing simplifies operations and reduces resource requirements in the network by removing network state information from intermediate routers and placing path information into packet headers at the ingress node. This improves operational flexibility and agility for cost-effective user experiences as fewer network elements are involved, avoiding slow response to sudden network changes.Juniper is set to capitalize on the growing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence. The company is offering new suites of products, such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others. With the growing use of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up. This has resulted in higher demand for advanced networking architecture, leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches. Juniper is expected to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support incremental growth in data traffic.Despite short-term challenges, particularly within the cloud and service provider verticals, Juniper expects healthy progress in most areas of its business, which augurs well for its long-term growth. The company has made significant changes to its go-to-market structure to better align its sales strategies with each of its core customer verticals. Moreover, several new products are in the pipeline, which are expected to further strengthen its competitive position across service provider, cloud and enterprise markets.The stock has lost 9.9% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 30.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ooma Inc.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.Management believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide another measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginAdjusted operating income (loss) is computed by excluding the following items from operating income:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(2) Impairment related charges and other costs. These adjustments include charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Other costs include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, and related professional service costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency, consequently restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs also include legal settlements, executive separation costs, and changes in accounting principle recorded within the period. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, this category includes costs related to the recent internal investigation and associated remediation activities which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional service fees, as well as turnover and other employee-related costs.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.(4) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted net income (loss) consists of the reported net income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above, the related income tax impacts, and discrete income tax adjustments such as: final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.These adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted ShareAdjusted earnings (loss) (EPS) per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted earnings (losses) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Contact InformationInvestors:Andrea DaleyVP, Investor Relations+1-704-805-1293InvestorRelations@dentsplysirona.com]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now.The oil industry notched record gains in 2022 and analysts are hopeful that the industry would continue to post record profits this year as they see no end in sight to the catalysts that gave boost to oil companies in the previous year. According to a latest report by Deloitte, in 2022, the global upstream industry was projected to generate its highest-ever free cash flows of $1.4 trillion at an assumed average Brent oil price of $106/bbl.Recently, the International Energy Agency said that Russia’s output could decline by 14% in the first quarter of 2023. If Russia’s production declines, oil prices, which started the year on a lower note, could again start to climb towards new highs. The IEA believes that the full effects of the oil embargo on Russia would begin to show its effects in the coming weeks. The agency also increased its oil demand forecasts for 2023 by 300,000 barrels a day, mainly due to growth in India and China’s decision to remove COVID restrictions. Consumption in the year, according to the agency, is expected to grow by a whopping 1.7 million barrels a day to reach 101.6 million barrels a day.JPMorgan in December also outlined its bullish thesis for the oil industry. According to Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan analysts said that while recession will keep the global economic growth in check, the oil industry will see a strong growth as countries like China begin to remove COVID restrictions. JPMorgan thinks that mobility fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel will drive much of the demand increase.JPMorgan also said that the G7 price cap would not be able to affect the Russian oil production significantly, while countries including the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Norway and Guyana will combine to boost global production.According to JPMorgan, the price of Brent crude will average $90 per barrel in 2023 and end the year at about $94.Story continuesIn addition to the fundamental growth, the oil and gas industry will continue to pour billions in the green energy space. The Deloitte report said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act will provide for about $450 billion of clean energy and related investments. The report also mentioned the Fit for 55 climate package passed by the European Commission and also the REPowerEU plan, which was launched to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. The report said that together, the committed provisions for the clean energy transition and emissions reduction are close to €300 billion.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey proprietary database of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 American oil stocks. These oil stocks have solid fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. The list is ranked in an ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now11. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Ranking 11th on the list of the best American oil stocks, Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is a New York-based company that is involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. In early December, Hess (NYSE:HES) declared a $0.375/share quarterly dividend, in line with the previous. A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes is $1.22 billion.In December, Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai upped the price target for Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) to $155 from $145 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The update came after the company posted Q3 results.10. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is a major American energy company that performed exceptionally well in 2022. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) gained about 60% over the past 12 months. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is also a dividend payer, with over a 3% dividend yield as of January 9. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) plans to cut its debt in the coming months. As of the end of the third quarter, the refiner’s debt came in at $5.6 billion. During the third quarter earnings call, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)’s management said that it has been working in the “right direction” since its debt to market cap ratio is 24.5% as of the end of Q3, compared to 40% during the COVID crisis.9. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a Texas-based company that accounts for a major portion of the world's hydraulic fracturing operations. In December, Raymond James gave a Strong Buy rating to the oil services company. The firm believes that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is expected to profit amid a favorable macro backdrop for the oil services industry. Raymond James’ James Rollyson said in a note to investors that “a sustained period of underinvestment during an exceptionally weak macro environment coupled with rising energy transition pressures set up the current oil supply situation.” Based on this thesis, the investment firm thinks the oil services industry will enjoy free cash flow generated for a “sustained period” because limited new capacity in the industry provides for an extended period of strong margins.Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides energy, engineering and construction services and is a manufacturer of products for the energy industry. The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”8.

Below are five reasons why the strength in steel stocks is slated to continue:1.   Global Demand is Set to Rise: Most economies worldwide have reopened following the coronavirus pandemic. However, China, the second-largest economy in the world, is just starting to reopen. Furthermore, the Chinese government has stepped in to aid its ailing real estate market in recent weeks. Increased demand from China is bound to move the needle for global demand.2.   Industry Group Strength: The Steel – Producers Industry is currently ranked 9 out of 250 industries tracked by Zacks.

Using the Zacks Rank we can identify stocks that are forecasted to have improving earnings. Companies with growing earnings in a slowing economy can provide a cushion many investors’ portfolios need.A major headwind for stocks continues to be persistent inflation. Picking stocks in commodities-based businesses can be a great way to use inflation as a tailwind. Aligning macro trends with signals from the Zacks Rank can act like a cheat code for investors.It is also worth considering that although many analysts agree the near future looks gloomy, consensus agreements can be wrong.Current data may be showing a slowing economy, but broadly speaking things are still quite robust. There is a possibility that we will have a persistently strong economy in 2023, so I also share a stock that should perform well in that case.Archer-Daniels-MidlandArcher-Daniels-Midland ADM is an international agricultural commodities company. ADM trade, transport, store, process and merchandise a wide range of raw agricultural materials. Archer-Daniels-Midland currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicating strong positive earnings revision growth.Inflation has been a boon for the commodities and raw materials industries and ADM was not excluded. Revenue and more importantly, earnings have rallied tremendously since inflation gained momentum. In the charts below we can see revenue jumped from ~$65 billion to nearly $100 billion between 2020 and 2022, and EPS more than doubled.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADM currently trades at a P/E of 11.5x, which is below both its industry average and its own 10yr median. And ADM offers a dividend yield of 1.9%, which it has continuously raised throughout the company history.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCleveland-Cliff Inc. Cleveland-Cliff, formerly Cliff Natural Resources, is a flat-rolled steel producer and the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America. Since 2019 CLF has experienced a huge boom in revenue going from just under $2 billion in 2019 to over $20 billion today, in part thanks to strategic acquisitions. CLF has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and trades at a P/E of 3.6x, which is well below the industry average of 15x, and its 10yr median of 6x.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the chart below we can see that after rolling over in mid-2022, 2023 earnings trends have begun to turn higher again. This is encouraging action for the stock as Zacks research demonstrates that upwards revisions in earnings expectations strongly correlates with future price gains.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited RentalsUnited Rentals is a construction and industrial equipment rental company. URI rents out a range of different equipment including forklifts, earthmoving equipment, and scissor lifts to customers such as industrial firms, utilities, homeowners, and government entities.United Rentals is a company that would benefit from positive trends in housing, construction, and infrastructure. While many analysts are expecting these industries to slow considerably over the next year, it is very possible those analysts are wrong. Furthermore, it is hard to argue with the earnings data, and stock price.URI is nearing its all-time high stock price, and earnings revisions continue to trend higher. You can see in the chart below how consistently earnings expectations have trended higher since 2020. This is a rare sight and may indicate that there is another leg higher in the economy before things eventually roll over.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlong with the other two, URI has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) but because of its economic drivers may provide a return that is uncorrelated a commodities business like ADM.ConclusionWhether the economy will be weak or strong this year is truly unknown, but that doesn't mean you can’t find stocks that may perform well. The Zacks Rank is one tool that can provide investors with stocks that regularly outperform the market.Additionally, it is interesting to consider that the Zacks Ranks may provide some insights into what is happening in the economy. Caterpillar CAT, the well-known construction company, recently made new highs, and like URI has positively trending earnings revisions. Not something you would expect to see in a recession.While analyzing the market it can be easy to get carried away by narratives, but it’s extremely important to keep an open mind.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $388.74 in the previous session. United Rentals has gained 5.8% since the start of the year compared to the -19.2% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the -19.8% return for the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2022, United Rentals reported EPS of $9.27 versus consensus estimate of $9.For the current fiscal year, United Rentals is expected to post earnings of $37.14 per share on $11.64 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $41.66 per share on $13 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.16% and 11.74%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUnited Rentals may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.United Rentals has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 7.6X versus its peer group's average of 9.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.56. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, United Rentals currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if United Rentals passes the test. Thus, it seems as though United Rentals shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

301,6836d878-0dfa-3311-8b89-b13339246b12,HAS,2023-01-11,15 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-lgbtq-friendly-companies-135943554.html,1673359183,STORY,"['KO', 'HAS', 'IBM', 'SBUX', 'V', 'AAL', 'ACN', 'WMT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US.Go back a few decades and the LGBTQ movement didn't even exist. According to many historians, the start of the modern gay rights movement took place in 1965 in Philadelphia. Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)One of the biggest software companies in the world, has consistently provided donations to LGBTQ non-profit organizations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also released an Xbox Pride controller, which you can decide whether its a capitalist twist on LGBTQ support or genuine support.12. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)One of the largest airlines in the world, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) was the first major U.S. airlines to protect LGBTQ members among its employees by including sexual orientation and gender identity in its workplace nondiscrimination policies. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) created a dedicated ""Rainbow Team"" to implement LGBTQ policies in the company in 1993 after a fax was leaked to new outlets where an employee requested changing pillows and blankets because of activists returning from a gay march in Washington.11. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Just like all other organizations in our list of the most friendly LGBTQ companies in the world, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is committed to ensuring that it provides an inclusive environment for all employees regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has faced some flack in the way it treats its employees, including being against unions.

(NYSE:WMT)The largest company in the world by revenue, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also the largest private employer in the U.S. with more than 2 million employees which is why Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) support for the LGBTQ community matters a lot. Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:V)The American financial services company has been a proud support of the LGBTQ community for a while now. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has continued to emphasize its policy of inclusion and diversity with one of its policies being the creation of employee resource groups, which includes Visa Pride. Furthermore, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has also provided support to the United Nations Standards for LBGTQ, which is ""a best-practice guide for policies and practices for LGBTI employees and inclusive workplaces.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McDonald's Corp. MCD, Wingstop Inc. WING, Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI and Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Solid Stocks to Buy on Soaring Restaurant SalesRetail sales unexpectedly declined in November but restaurant sales saw an impressive jump as people continued to spend more at eateries. The Fed’s has interest rate hikes to fight soaring inflation impacted retail sales. However, people spent aggressively at bars and restaurants.Although inflation is still at multi-year highs, prices have somewhat cooled lately, indicating that inflation has been slowing. This has also been helping sales at restaurants. Given this scenario, stocks like McDonald's Corp., Wingstop Inc., Darden Restaurants, Inc. and Domino's Pizza, Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales GrowingSales at bars and restaurants in the United States increased 0.9% in November after jumping 1.6% in October. The figure is definitely impressive given that the growth in sales comes despite sky-high commodity prices.High prices have been impacting retail sales, which declined sharply in November. Retail sales dropped 0.6%, more than double the expectations of a 0.3% drop and the steepest decline in the past five months. Retail sales did, however, increase 6.5% year over year in November.Consumer spending has been constrained due to rising commodity prices, which is hurting the retail sector. The restaurant industry has nevertheless managed to put up a great performance, with revenues increasing practically every month.People have been eating out more frequently ever since the COVID-induced lockdown ended and the economy reopened. Thus, it is hardly surprising that sales at pubs and restaurants have been steadily increasing.Story continuesThe retail industry was one of the worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, with restaurant sales taking a massive hit. After that, sales started to increase once again, but the recovery was unstable because COVID-related restrictions were still in place and millions of people were reluctant to interact confidently in social settings.Things finally started changing in 2022 and the industry began to ostensibly show indications of revival. Sales have now returned to their pre-pandemic levels and are expected to increase going forward.Still Challenges AplentyDuring normal times, customers typically spend more on services than on goods. Due to the lack of options, this altered during the epidemic, with people spending more on goods than services.However, things are once again back to normal and people have started spending more on services. Restaurants are the only services category included in retail sales.Rising prices though remain a concern. Restaurant owners are working extremely hard to overcome the challenges, especially rising costs. Restaurants are strongly focusing on digital innovation, trying to boost sales, and putting cost-cutting measures into place, which is aiding in the revival of the sector.Digital innovation is now a crucial component in increasing sales because of the Internet's increasing significance. Delivery services and online platforms are commonly used by large restaurant chains, which has increased revenues.Also, the restaurant industry has been adding a lot of jobs. In December, the leisure and hospitality sector added 67,000 jobs, according to the most recent Labor Department data.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these four restaurant stocks.McDonald's Corp. is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.

The Fed’s has interest rate hikes to fight soaring inflation impacted retail sales. However, people spent aggressively at bars and restaurants.Although inflation is still at multi-year highs, prices have somewhat cooled lately, indicating that inflation has been slowing. This has also been helping sales at restaurants. Given this scenario, stocks like McDonald's Corporation MCD, Wingstop Inc. WING, Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI and Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales GrowingSales at bars and restaurants in the United States increased 0.9% in November after jumping 1.6% in October. The figure is definitely impressive given that the growth in sales comes despite sky-high commodity prices.High prices have been impacting retail sales, which declined sharply in November. Retail sales dropped 0.6%, more than double the expectations of a 0.3% drop and the steepest decline in the past five months. Retail sales did, however, increase 6.5% year over year in November.Consumer spending has been constrained due to rising commodity prices, which is hurting the retail sector. The restaurant industry has nevertheless managed to put up a great performance, with revenues increasing practically every month.People have been eating out more frequently ever since the COVID-induced lockdown ended and the economy reopened. Thus, it is hardly surprising that sales at pubs and restaurants have been steadily increasing.The retail industry was one of the worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, with restaurant sales taking a massive hit. After that, sales started to increase once again, but the recovery was unstable because COVID-related restrictions were still in place and millions of people were reluctant to interact confidently in social settings.Story continuesThings finally started changing in 2022 and the industry began to ostensibly show indications of revival. Sales have now returned to their pre-pandemic levels and are expected to increase going forward.Still Challenges AplentyDuring normal times, customers typically spend more on services than on goods. Due to the lack of options, this altered during the epidemic, with people spending more on goods than services.However, things are once again back to normal and people have started spending more on services. Restaurants are the only services category included in retail sales.Rising prices though remain a concern. Restaurant owners are working extremely hard to overcome the challenges, especially rising costs. Restaurants are strongly focusing on digital innovation, trying to boost sales, and putting cost-cutting measures into place, which is aiding in the revival of the sector.Digital innovation is now a crucial component in increasing sales because of the Internet's increasing significance. Delivery services and online platforms are commonly used by large restaurant chains, which has increased revenues.Also, the restaurant industry has been adding a lot of jobs. In December, the leisure and hospitality sector added 67,000 jobs, according to the most recent Labor Department data.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these four restaurant stocks.McDonald's Corporation is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.

This is expected to be January 18, 2023. On that day, Prologis is projected to report earnings of $1.21 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.04%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.41 billion, up 31.5% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Prologis. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

(or any other month) sells itself. Even the wealthiest among us find great deals attractive. Indeed, it takes a special kind of person to deliberately acquire something that’s overvalued for no good reason. As well, the wild market volatility in 2022 brings to the table amazing opportunities regarding value stocks to buy. Sure, no one likes seeing red ink in their portfolio. However, with a little bit of patience, less-appreciated ideas can potentially blossom.However, anytime this subject materializes, it begs the question: undervalued by whom or by what standard? To address this uncertainty, the value stocks to buy below all feature rock-solid financials. And for our purposes, these ideas are objectively undervalued relative to trailing 12-month sales. So with that out of the way, below are the value picks you should potentially consider.THOThor Industries$83.22HZOMarineMax$32.03GRVYGravity$42.33CTSHCognizant Technology$59.75JRSHJerash Holdings$3.98REXREX American Resources$30.38TROWT. Rowe Price$112.29InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThor Industries (THO)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comOn paper, Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) doesn’t exactly strike investors as one of the value stocks to buy. While the recreational vehicle specialist garnered intense demand during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, society has since largely normalized it. Therefore, the social-distancing vacation no longer carries the appeal that it once did. Plus, there’s the matter of the trailing one-year performance of a loss of over 26%. Apparently, most investors don’t have much confidence in THO stock. Still, for those seeking objective value, Thor Industries may be worth a look.Currently, the market prices THO at 0.27 times sales. For comparison, the sector median stands at 0.75 times. Also, Wall Street prices Thor at 4.2 times TTM earnings, which sits nearly 94% below industry players. To be fair, of the two analysts covering THO, the consensus rates as a hold – not exactly encouraging. However, hedge funds recently started bidding up shares, making Thor one of the value stocks to buy.Story continuesMarineMax (HZO)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAnother name that doesn’t quite strike investors as one of the value stocks to buy, MarineMax (NYSE:HZO) specializes in selling boats and other watersports-related vehicles. Here’s the problem. With consumer sentiment in the toilet, few people are rushing to buy what are effectively money pits. It also doesn’t help that in the trailing year, HZO gave up 45% of equity value.Narrative-wise, MarineMax presents high risks, especially if you’re concerned about a possible incoming recession. I could be wrong but recessions and boats don’t usually mix. Then again, MarineMax’s core clients may be much more insulated from economic pressures. You’ve got to have plenty of discretionary income to be in the boating space.Further, as it relates to value stocks to buy, HZO presents an undeniably objective case. Currently, the market prices MarineMax at 0.31 times sales, below the sector median of 0.68 times. As well, HZO features a price of 0.88-times book. In contrast, the sector price-to-book ratio stands at 1.49 times.Gravity (GRVY)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Seoul, South Korea, Gravity (NASDAQ:GRVY) is a video game company. Per its public profile, the company garnered attention for its multiplayer online role-playing game Ragnarok Online. Apparently, it’s one of the more popular titles out there. Unfortunately, such a status did not exempt GRVY from volatility. In the trailing year, shares gave up nearly 43% of equity value.However, with the red ink comes a potentially compelling discount. According to Gurufocus.com, GRVY represents one of the most underappreciated names among value stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices GRVY at 0.91 times sales. In contrast, the sector median pings at 2.48 times. Also, it trades for 1.26 times the book value, compared to the sector median of 2 times.In addition, Wall Street pegs Gravity shares at just under 7 times TTM earnings. That puts the company favorably lower than 85% of the competition. If you need more convincing, please note that Gravity features zero debt, affording it flexibility during these uncertain times.Cognizant Technology (CTSH)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Based in Teaneck, New Jersey, Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) is a multinational information technology services and consulting firm. Although providing a relevant profile for the broader business ecosystem, Cognizant couldn’t appease the market gods. In the trailing year, CTSH crumbled quite badly, giving up nearly 35% of its equity value. To be fair, though, shares did gain almost 2% in the past five days.Perhaps, investors at large may be sensing that CTSH ranks among the value stocks to buy. Right now, the market prices Cognizant at 1.55 times sales. For comparison, the underlying sector median stands at 2.3 times. Also, Cognizant’s price relative to free cash flow pings at 12.6 times. This equates to the company coming in roughly 73% below the competition.Notably, Cognizant enjoys a strong balance sheet, featuring an Altman Z-Score of 6.28, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Moreover, the IT firm’s return on equity stands just under 20%, beating out 84% of its rivals. This stat also reflects a very high-quality business, making CTSH one of the value stocks to buy.Jerash Holdings (JRSH)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAn apparel-manufacturing firm, Jerash Holdings (NASDAQ:JRSH) admittedly presents risks. Again, with the consumer economy sliding, it may be tougher for households to pony up for discretionary goods. However, Jerash does have the advantage of partnering with some of the world’s top brands. These include globally recognized luxury players.Unfortunately, from a technical perspective, JRSH consistently suffered throughout 2022. In the trailing year, shares tumbled by more than 39%. That said, it does ping as one of the more dependable value stocks to buy. Primarily, that’s because of the company’s balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of slightly over 10 times, Jerash faces economic uncertainties with a strong war chest.Regarding valuation metrics, the market prices JRSH at 0.35 times, below nearly 75% of apparel competitors. Also, JRSH trades at 0.69 times its tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median is 1.2 times. Finally, the company’s price-earnings ratio pings at 9.7 times, below the industry median of 13.7 times.REX American Resources (REX)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comOperating out of Dayton, Ohio, REX American Resources (NYSE:REX) is a producer and retailer of ethanol, distillers grains, and natural gas as well as a holding company in energy entities. Fundamentally, the recent rush for critical commodities boosted the relevance for REX American. In turn, the trailing-year performance for REX shares came out to 10% below parity.By any other standard, that’s not good at all. However, with the benchmark equities index slipping 19% during the same period because of extraordinary headwinds, REX gets some respect. Moving onto the subject at hand – value stocks to buy – REX makes an intriguing case. For one thing, you wouldn’t just be acquiring a discount for its own sake. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys a cash-to-debt ratio of 19.6 times. That’s better than over 83% of its peers.Presently, the market prices REX at 0.6 times sales, well below the sector median of 1.32 times. As well, REX trades at 1.18 times tangible book, coming in lower than nearly 70% of the industry.T. Rowe Price (TROW)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comPerhaps the riskiest idea within this list of value stocks to buy, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) represents a global investment management firm that offers funds, sub-advisory services, separate account management, and retirement plans and services for individuals, institutions, and financial intermediaries.To be sure, investor sentiment broadly faces challenges because of the deflationary forces affecting the equities sector. Not surprisingly, in the trailing year, TROW stock gave up 43% of its equity value, a steep loss. Nevertheless, an argument can be made that deflationary markets provide an opportunity for distinction. After all, anybody can pick stocks in a decisively bullish market cycle.At the moment, Wall Street prices TROW at 3.6 times sales, well below the sector median of 6.1 times. Also, TROW trades hands at 9.43 times FCF, below more than 63% of its rivals. Finally, prospective investors have confidence in a solid balance sheet. Per Gurufocus.com, T. Rowe Price’s Altman Z-Score stands at 9, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This provides us the ability to deliver over 1 million packages by drone in a year.”With a 10-pound weight limit, the UAVs supplied by partner DroneUp, Walmart said “customer favorites delivered by drones are Great Value Cookies and Cream Ice Cream, 2lb Bag of Lemons, Rotisserie Chicken, Red Bull and Bounty Paper Towels” thus far.Read: Walmart Ups Drone Delivery Comp With Amazon, Expands Program to 6 StatesDroneUp followed Walmart’s May announcement with one of its own, saying in a blog post that “we’ve seen a positive response from Walmart's customers that have used the service. In fact, while Walmart initially thought customers would use the service for emergency items, we’re finding they use it for its sheer convenience, like a quick fix for a weeknight meal. Case in point: The top-selling item at one of our current hubs is Hamburger Helper.”Ironically, Amazon is trailing despite its founder owning an operational space flight company (Blue Origin). The eCommerce leader unveiled its new Prime Air drone design — the MK30 — in a November blog post, saying its “increased range, expanded temperature tolerance, safety-critical features, and new capability to fly in light rain will enable customers to choose drone delivery more often.”Prime Air Primed for TakeoffIn June, Amazon announced the first locations to be getting Amazon Prime Air drone deliveries, including Lockeford, California, and College Station, Texas. Those sites rely on the smaller MK27-2 drone that handles packages of 5 pounds or less. The MK30 is for heavier loads.Story continuesDrone delivery went from science fiction to aero-commerce fact in about six years, from Amazon’s Jeff Bezos talking about the idea during a 2013 appearance on “60 Minutes” to the first-ever delivery — made by Google parent Alphabet’s Wing drone — in West Virginia in 2019.On December 22, Prime Air made its first drone deliveries in California and Texas. Amazon Vice President Prime Air at Amazon David Carbon wrote on LinkedIn: “First deliveries from our new sites in TX and CA. Couldn’t be prouder of the amazing people that make up Prime Air. These are careful first steps that we will turn into giant leaps for our customers over the next number of years.”Read: Amazon Answers Walmart’s Drone Push With Limited Launch Later This YearAlso in December, Wing talked up its new Remote Operations Center in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, saying in a separate blog post that in 2022 its largest delivery operation in Logan, Australia, “a service area of roughly 70,000 people, there were days in 2022 when we made over 1,000 deliveries — about one delivery every 25 seconds.”Delivery Drones to the RescueThe pandemic accelerated drone delivery just as it did other contactless forms of commerce. In April 2020, CVS Health Corp. and the United Parcel Service’s (UPS) UPS Flight Forward unit partnered for prescription delivery by drone in The Villages in central Florida, the largest retirement community in the U.S. with roughly 135,000 residents.Read: Zipline Gets FAA Approval for Drone Delivery of Healthcare ProductsUsing the M2 drone system from Matternet, former UPS chief strategy and transformation officer Scott Price said in a subsequent blog post that “Our new drone delivery service will help CVS provide safe and efficient deliveries of medicines to this large retirement community, enabling residents to receive medications without leaving their homes.”For its part, FedEx has partnered with Elroy Air, saying in a March 2022 press release, “The exponential growth of e-commerce has accelerated the demand for reliable, efficient transportation and logistics solutions throughout all stages of the supply chain.”Additionally, PYMNTS reported in June that “U.S. regulators have approved Zipline International to make drone-based healthcare product deliveries from its headquarters in North Carolina.”See: UPS Uses Drones To Deliver PrescriptionsFor all PYMNTS retail coverage, subscribe to the daily Retail Newsletter.]"

""The business plan enhancements announced today reflect the meaningful progress we are making and the confidence we have in our ability to continue PPL's growth momentum well into the future.""Highlights of PPL's updated business plan include:Top-tier EPS and dividend growth through at least 2026. PPL has extended its runway for earnings and dividend growth and now expects 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth through at least 2026. In addition, the company continues to see significant investment opportunities that support growth beyond the current planning horizon as PPL leads the clean energy transition in the regions it serves and delivers exceptional value to its customers.$14.3 billion of capital investments through 2026, a &gt;20% increase from prior plan. As reflected in recent regulatory filings in Kentucky and Rhode Island to invest in critical infrastructure, PPL has numerous opportunities for investments that strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and economically replace aging coal generation with reliable, least-cost and clean energy sources. Since announcing its capital plan last year, PPL has identified an additional $2.5 billion in investment opportunities for grid modernization and resiliency, digital transformation and generation replacement in Kentucky. The planned investments increase PPL's projected average annual rate base growth rate to 5.6% through 2026, with greater than 7% rate base growth in the back half of the plan. The plan features minimal regulatory lag based on existing regulatory mechanisms.Strong balance sheet and credit metrics maintained. PPL's balance sheet is among the best in the U.S. utility sector and will support the company's increased capital investment plan and continued financial flexibility with no equity issuances. PPL's continued strong credit profile reflects a projected Funds from Operations (FFO)/Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) to debt ratio of 16% to 18% throughout the planning period.At least $175 million of O&amp;M cost savings to support efficiency and affordability. PPL is increasing its targeted operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) savings by $25 million to $175 million of annual O&amp;M savings by 2026. The added savings will be driven largely by the company's transmission and distribution operations as PPL continues to deploy scalable technologies and data science and leverage management's proven operating expertise across the company's utility portfolio.Significant improvements in PPL's carbon footprint.The updated plan announced today advances the company's broader clean energy strategy, aligns with the company's goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and is expected to result in total carbon emissions reductions of about 67% from 2010 levels by 2030. The plan includes a proposal to retire nearly 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation in Kentucky by 2028. The proposal, subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval, would add two new combined-cycle natural gas plants, nearly 1,000 megawatts of owned and contracted solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage by 2028. Additionally, PPL's investments in critical infrastructure and grid modernization will further enable a flexible, resilient grid capable of integrating more distributed energy resources and supporting electrification.Story continues2023 earnings outlook and expected dividend increasePPL announced today that it expects 2023 earnings in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share. At the $1.58 midpoint, this represents 13% growth over the 2022 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $1.40 per share (reflecting partial year ownership of Rhode Island Energy) and a 7% increase over the $1.48 midpoint of PPL's 2022 pro forma earnings per share range (reflecting a full year of earnings contributions from Rhode Island Energy).The company also announced that it expects to increase its next quarterly common stock dividend to $0.24 per share, subject to approval by the Board of Directors. This would represent a 7% increase from the current dividend of $0.225 per share.Longtime utility veteran Linda G. Sullivan joins PPL Board of DirectorsPPL announced that utility industry veteran Linda G. Sullivan has joined its Board of Directors, effective Jan. 10, 2023. She will serve on PPL's Compensation and Finance committees. With Sullivan's appointment, PPL's board comprises 10 directors. In addition to an independent chair, the board includes eight independent directors and PPL's chief executive officer. Seven of the board's members are diverse across gender, race, ethnicity and nationality.""Linda's deep utility and financial expertise will further strengthen and complement our diverse and experienced board,"" said independent Board Chair Craig A. Rogerson.

319,dc4ba3ba-bc12-3eaa-a503-47da4d3c4165,MDLZ,2023-01-11,Mondelez (MDLZ) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-mdlz-gains-lags-market-231511612.html,1673392511,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[In the latest trading session, Mondelez (MDLZ) closed at $67.31, marking a +0.1% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.7% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 7.5%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum had lost 0.21% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 0.13% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.94% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Mondelez as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Mondelez to post earnings of $0.71 per share. This would mark no growth from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.33 billion, up 8.78% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Mondelez. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.43% higher within the past month. Mondelez currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Mondelez has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.67 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.05, so we one might conclude that Mondelez is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that MDLZ has a PEG ratio of 3.2 right now.

The branded convenience food products provider benefits from strength in its Snacks business and focus on innovation. The company is focused on cost-saving efforts amid a rising inflationary environment.The above-mentioned upsides boosted Campbell Soup’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year. Solid quarterly performance prompted management to raise its fiscal 2023 view.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 14.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 8.6% growth. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 4.5% growth in the period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImpressive Performance, Bright ViewIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Campbell Soup’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $1.02 per share, mainly reflecting a rise in adjusted earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). Net sales of $2,575 million increased 15% on a reported and organic basis. The upside can be attributed to brand strength, inflation-driven pricing and continued supply recovery. Retailer inventory rebuild and solid recovery in the company’s foodservice business were upsides. The company grew or held market share in most categories from the year-ago quarter’s level.Considering its solid fiscal first-quarter results that reflect continued demand and enhanced supply chain execution, management raised its fiscal 2023 view during its quarterly earnings release. The outlook also reflects the dynamic economic environment. For fiscal 2023, the company now expects 7-9% net sales growth, with 7-9% organic sales growth. Earlier, management had expected 4-6% net sales growth, with 4-6% organic sales growth for fiscal 2023. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are envisioned to be up 2-5% to come in at $2.90-$3.00. Earlier, adjusted EPS was projected to be flat to up 4%.Story continuesSnacks Business: Key DriverCampbell Soup is benefitting from its growing Snacks business. The segment formed 43.5% of the company’s top line in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales in the division rose 15% (also organically) to $1,120 million. The upside can be attributed to sales of power brands which rose 21%. Sales growth was fueled by a rise in cookies and crackers, specifically Goldfish crackers and in salty snacks, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand and CapeCod potato chips. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were somewhat offset by soft volume and higher promotional spending.Campbell Soup’s Snacks unit has been standing out for a while now. This business is likely to tap incremental sales, backed by a proven growth model with strength in the power snacks brands and higher innovation.Savings Plan on TrackCampbell Soup has been progressing well with its cost-saving plan. The company’s strategy of concentrating on supply-chain efficiencies, curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in high-growth potential areas is noteworthy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company generated $10 million in savings under its multi-year cost-saving program, including Snyder’s-Lance synergies, bringing total program-to-date cost savings to $860 million. Management is on track to deliver savings worth $1 billion by fiscal 2025-end.Such well-chalked out saving efforts along with its prudent investment and strategic efforts towards brand building are likely to keep narrating CPB’s growth story.3 Solid Staple PicksSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Lamb Weston LW and Mondelez International, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share, indicating a change of +29.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.63 points to a change of +277.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -7.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.85 indicates a change of -28.9% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $8.89 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $37.49 billion and $33.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +42.5% and -10%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QGEN recently announced the completion of the acquisition of Verogen — a provider of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to increase its position in human identification and forensics. The acquisition of Verogen fortifies QIAGEN’s position in the fast-growing field of Human ID and forensics anchored by sample collection and preparation, genetic testing analysis and workflow automation.For investors’ note, the deal was built on a partnership launched in 2021 to distribute Verogen’s Illumina MiSeq FGx sequencer, NGS-based panels and GEDmatch bioinformatics solutions.Transaction DetailsQIAGEN acquired Verogen for $150 million in cash, which was paid from existing reserves. Currently, the company expects about $20 million of sales from the Verogen portfolio in 2023, building on about $5 million that it booked in 2022 from the distribution agreement. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to full-year 2023 adjusted EPS by about $0.03 per share and neutral to adjusted EPS in 2024.About VerogenFounded in 2017, Verogen is a privately held company based in San Diego. The company supports the global human identification community with NGS tools and professional services to help resolve criminal and missing persons cases.Strategic ImplicationsPer QIAGEN’s management, bringing Verogen and QIAGEN develops a unique opportunity to help investigators and researchers to accelerate forensic science and to find missing persons, accurately spot suspects and exonerate the innocent. The power of NGS has formed so many applications that were not possible before, and its usage in forensics is another prospect for QIAGEN to offer the complete workflow and help enhance the lives of people around the world.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerogen’s sequencing and analysis solutions are intended for use on the MiSeq FGx Sequencing System from Illumina, Inc. With this acquisition, QIAGEN obtains exclusive distribution rights for this version of the MiSeq sequencer developed specifically for forensics applications.Story continuesWith acquisition, Qiagen also gains complete access to Verogen’s revolutionary GEDmatch database and GEDmatch PRO portal. GEDmatch enables users to upload genetic profiles developed by other genealogy sites in order to expand the search for familial links and is intended to aid police and forensic teams with investigative comparisons to data uploaded by consenting GEDmatch users.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global forensic technology market size was $4.30 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 10.2% by 2030. The rising number of cases of homicide, robbery, rape, and murder are the factors driving the market.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, QIAGEN entered into a strategic partnership with Helix to advance companion diagnostics for hereditary diseases. The partnership is intended to leverage the Helix Laboratory Platform powered by QIAGEN’s biopharma relationships, NGS capabilities, and global regulatory expertise.Last month, QIAGEN announced the receipt of the FDA approval for its therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR kit (therascreen KRAS kit).

Per the agreement, the companies plan to do a whole-genome sequence of approximately 35,000 DNA samples.Sequencing this set of samples is the first under Illumina and Nashville Biosciences' Alliance for Genomic Discovery (AGD). This is a multiyear agreement to accelerate therapeutic development through large-scale genomics and establish a pre-eminent clinico-genomic data set.The AGD was launched in 2022 with a target to whole-genome sequence at least 250,000 de-identified human DNA samples from VUMC's BioVU biobank over two and a half years under collaborations with multiple biopharmaceutical companies.More on the NewsIn this regard, Illumina noted that commonly the genomic data sets are drawn from people of European ancestry. This leads to a lack of diversity in genomic data. This thereby creates a gap between the scientific understanding of the underlying genetic causes of disease and hinders equitable access to precision health therapies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTo address this, the companies this time have taken the sample cohort primarily made up of DNA from African Americans. This sample set, per Illumina, underrepresents research for the clinical applications of genomics, including drug target discovery. With the latest development, this cohort is going to be the largest data set of genomes of its kind to date.Strong Prospects in the Genetic Health MarketIllumina is currently keeping pace with its goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing worldwide market with some highly competitive products in its existing portfolio and pipeline. This market is developing rapidly on a global scale, allowing the company to witness continuous growth in the number of non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) samples.Within reproductive health, consistent strength in NIPT supported revenue growth across the APJ (the Asia Pacific and Japan) region in the third quarter of 2022. Growth in the region was driven by strong demand in emerging markets, notably in India, Indonesia and Thailand and continued strength in NIPT and oncology testing.In genetic disease testing, sequencing consumable shipments grew 11% year over year in the third quarter. National health system funding for rare diseases is increasing in multiple geographies, including EMEA and China and evidence generation continues to grow.Story continuesShare Price PerformanceIn the past year, Illumina has underperformed its industry.

326,24c37f11-5f37-3665-ba40-c3b8dc691fca,COF,2023-01-11,What kind of credit cards are good to use at Costco?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kind-credit-cards-good-costco-170825689.html,1673370505,STORY,"['COST', 'COF-PJ']","[For those who prefer buying in bulk, Costco is a great place to trim spending on household goods and help balance your budget. But the discounted prices aren’t the only way to benefit when shopping at the discount warehouse giant. Selecting the right credit card for your Costco runs is another way to maximize the financial benefits of your spending.In addition to simply knowing what cards are accepted by Costco as forms of payment, some rewards cards simply make more sense for use at the store than others.Only Visa is acceptedPerhaps the first thing to know about shopping at Costco is that not all credit cards are accepted—the discount giant accepts only Visa cards. It will not take Mastercard, American Express, or Discover as forms of payment.“Most retailers are happy to accept cards from any of the big four American credit card networks, but not Costco,” says Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst for LendingTree. ""That’s an important thing to understand…because the last thing you want to do is go up to the counter with a basket full of stuff and then find out that you can’t buy it because you only have a Mastercard.”In 2016, Costco ended its long standing partnership with American Express and adopted Visa as its preferred credit card provider. It’s part of an exclusive business agreement that helps Costco secure lower processing fees from Visa, says Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst, Bankrate and CreditCards.com.“The exclusive, however, is only for credit cards in-store,” says Rossman. Costco offers more flexibility when it comes to acceptable forms of payment for online purchases. According to the company’s website, online shoppers can also use Mastercard and Discover cards.Costco is not considered a grocery storeAnother point to keep in mind when using rewards credit cards at Costco is that the wholesale club is not considered a grocery store. This is an important distinction because it means that even if you fill your cart with food, you may not necessarily qualify for grocery rewards if you’re using a credit card that offers a bonus for that kind of purchase. It all depends on the terms of the agreement for your card.Story continues“Just because you can buy groceries at Costco doesn’t mean that you can earn grocery credit card rewards when you shop there,” explains Schulz. “The same thing goes for Target, Walmart, and other mega-retailers that sell food.”Credit card reward categories are determined by what’s known as a retailers’ merchant category code—not by the individual item you happen to purchase. And in the case of Costco, the discount warehouse club does not code as a grocery store.But just because you won’t necessarily earn grocery rewards when using your credit card at Costco, doesn’t mean you don’t benefit at all. At the very least you could earn 1% cash-back for general purchases—sometimes you might earn even more.Bottom line? Before heading to Costco, read the fine print of your credit card agreement to make sure you use the right cards and maximize your potential to earn points—or avoid accidentally missing out on points.What are the best credit cards to use at Costco?There are some rewards cards that can be particularly beneficial to use at Costco including many Capital One and Chase cards. In general, it’s a good idea to look for credit cards that offer higher rewards for general purchases in order to make the most of Costco purchases.Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardUnlimited 2X miles per dollar on every purchaseNew cardholders can earn up to 75,000 bonus miles if you spend $4,000 within first three months after opening an accountCapital One Venture Rewards Credit Card can be particularly valuable when shopping at Costco because it allows for cardholders to maximize the travel rewards they can earn on everyday purchases—2X miles for every dollar spent. “This means you could get at least $2 in travel value for every $100 you spend at Costco,” Rossman explains.The card comes with a $95 annual fee. Qualifying for the card requires an excellent credit score.Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit CardUnlimited 2X miles on everyday purchasesNew cardholders can earn up to 75,000 bonus miles if you spend $4,000 within first three months after opening an account, which is equal to $750 in travelThe Capital One Venture X Credit Card comes with a steep $395 fee but for serious Costco shoppers who spend a lot, there are also valuable rewards. New cardholders can earn 75,000 bonus miles after they spend $4,000 within the first three months of opening an account, and the Venture X offers an annual travel credit of up to $300, plus a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus (worth up to $100 toward travel).This card also requires an excellent credit score to qualify.Chase Freedom Unlimited®Unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases0% purchase APR for 15 months (then 18.74%–27.49% variable)No annual feeThe Chase Freedom Unlimited offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases and there’s no annual fee, which can make using it at Costco particularly valuable.And if you have other Chase cards that allow for transferring points, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, using the Freedom Unlimited to pay for Costco purchases can pay off even more. For instance, you could transfer points earned shopping at Costco with your Freedom Unlimited to your Sapphire Preferred card, and then use cash in those rewards via Chase Ultimate, where your rewards are worth 25% more when redeemed for travel.The takeawayCostco is a great way to make your dollars go further and stretch your budget. But don’t miss out on ways to maximize the financial payback of your Costo shopping trips. Selecting the right rewards card can pay dividends when making purchases at the discount wholesale club.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

This figure exceeds our expectations as it beats our model estimate of $18.0 billion. The figure also falls within the previously provided management guidance of $18-$19 billion.The company also expects to incur around $3.3 billion in R&amp;D expenses for 2022. Management expects to close the year with cash and cash equivalents of around $18.0 billion.Shares of Moderna have declined 16.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 17.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpdates 2023 GuidanceModerna expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID vaccine sales in 2023, based on confirmed advance purchase agreements and contract deferrals. Management also reported that this figure does not include product sales in the United States or new contracts with Europe, Japan and other key markets.Management is also focused on shifting the supply of its COVID-19 vaccines from government contracting to commercial distribution. Per a WSJ article, Moderna is expected to price its COVID-19 vaccine in the range of $110-$130 per dose.Moderna also announced plans to increase investment in R&amp;D expenses. It expects to spend around $4.5 billion in 2023. This is a sharp increase from the company’s previous R&amp;D expenses as it focuses on expanding its market portfolio to include products other than its COVID-19 vaccine.Pipeline UpdatesCurrently, Moderna has 48 programs in active development, with 36 programs undergoing clinical studies.Currently, Moderna has three late-stage candidates — mRNA-1647, mRNA-1345 and mRNA-1010 — in its pipeline, which are being developed as cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and influenza vaccine, respectively.Story continuesWith regard to mRNA-1010, management expects to report data from the immunogenicity study evaluating the influenza vaccine in adults in first-quarter 2023 while the data from the efficacy study evaluating the vaccine in older adults is expected later this year during the winter season.Management believes that the late-stage study evaluating its RSV vaccine has accrued sufficient cases required to complete its first interim efficacy analysis.Last month, Moderna and partner Merck MRK reported positive data from the phase IIb KEYNOTE-942 study, which evaluated their personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) candidate mRNA-4157/V940 combined with Merck’s blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda heavily treated melanoma patients. Data from the study showed that the mRNA-4157 combined with Merck’s Keytruda exhibited a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death by 44%.Based on the above data, Moderna and Merck plan to discuss these results with regulatory authorities and also plan to start a phase III study in melanoma patients late this year. Moderna and Merck also intend to expand the study of the PCV vaccine to additional tumor types.Moderna also announced the advancement of two new candidates to clinical-stage development. These include mRNA-0184, its heart failure treatment candidate, which is being evaluated in a phase Ib study in patients with stable heart failure. Another candidate is VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), which is being developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.Last month, Vertex announced that the FDA cleared the investigational new drug (IND) application seeking approval to start clinical studies on VX-522. While Vertex is responsible for leading the preclinical and clinical development of therapies, Moderna is responsible for mRNA and lipid nanoparticle process development and manufacturing. Moderna is also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of potential products resulting from this partnership with Vertex.Management also announced that it had purchased a new priority review voucher (PRV).

One-month return of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was -2.91%, and its shares gained 2.63% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a market capitalization of $268.682 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

This company, which is in the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest beverage maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.15%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Coke came out with earnings of $0.69 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share, representing a surprise of 7.81%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.70 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Coke lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Coke currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.32%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Coca-Cola European (CCEP) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Consumer Staples peers, we might be able to answer that question.Coca-Cola European is one of 198 individual stocks in the Consumer Staples sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #4 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Coca-Cola European is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Within the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCEP's full-year earnings has moved 5.6% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.Based on the most recent data, CCEP has returned 1.9% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Consumer Staples group have lost about 2% on average. This means that Coca-Cola European is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.Chewy (CHWY) is another Consumer Staples stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has returned 8.2%.In Chewy's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 70.4% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking more specifically, Coca-Cola European belongs to the Beverages - Soft drinks industry, a group that includes 16 individual stocks and currently sits at #27 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, stocks in this group have gained 6.7% this year, meaning that CCEP is slightly underperforming its industry in terms of year-to-date returns.Story continuesIn contrast, Chewy falls under the Consumer Products - Staples industry. Currently, this industry has 29 stocks and is ranked #189. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved -23.7%.Coca-Cola European and Chewy could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Consumer Staples stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Coca-Cola (KO) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.47 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 9, 2023.KO has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45.KO is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Clorox (CLX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on February 2, 2023, Clorox holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.75 a share 23 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clorox is $0.65, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 15.39%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, KO and CLX could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:35% = US$4.3b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.LyondellBasell Industries' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that LyondellBasell Industries has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 18% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Despite this, LyondellBasell Industries' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is LYB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is LyondellBasell Industries Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 43% (or a retention ratio of 57%), LyondellBasell Industries hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 53% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 20%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we feel that LyondellBasell Industries certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. In addition, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that the company's earnings are expected to continue to shrink.

343,a2ea7c64-7657-3e79-a5f7-e2545e30e304,GE,2023-01-11,Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on GE (GE): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-look-bullish-143002414.html,1673361002,STORY,['GE'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Electric (GE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.72, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 56.3% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is GE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 2.4% over the past month to $2.53.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now.The oil industry notched record gains in 2022 and analysts are hopeful that the industry would continue to post record profits this year as they see no end in sight to the catalysts that gave boost to oil companies in the previous year. According to a latest report by Deloitte, in 2022, the global upstream industry was projected to generate its highest-ever free cash flows of $1.4 trillion at an assumed average Brent oil price of $106/bbl.Recently, the International Energy Agency said that Russia’s output could decline by 14% in the first quarter of 2023. If Russia’s production declines, oil prices, which started the year on a lower note, could again start to climb towards new highs. The IEA believes that the full effects of the oil embargo on Russia would begin to show its effects in the coming weeks. The agency also increased its oil demand forecasts for 2023 by 300,000 barrels a day, mainly due to growth in India and China’s decision to remove COVID restrictions. Consumption in the year, according to the agency, is expected to grow by a whopping 1.7 million barrels a day to reach 101.6 million barrels a day.JPMorgan in December also outlined its bullish thesis for the oil industry. According to Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan analysts said that while recession will keep the global economic growth in check, the oil industry will see a strong growth as countries like China begin to remove COVID restrictions. JPMorgan thinks that mobility fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel will drive much of the demand increase.JPMorgan also said that the G7 price cap would not be able to affect the Russian oil production significantly, while countries including the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Norway and Guyana will combine to boost global production.According to JPMorgan, the price of Brent crude will average $90 per barrel in 2023 and end the year at about $94.Story continuesIn addition to the fundamental growth, the oil and gas industry will continue to pour billions in the green energy space. The Deloitte report said the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act will provide for about $450 billion of clean energy and related investments. The report also mentioned the Fit for 55 climate package passed by the European Commission and also the REPowerEU plan, which was launched to cut Europe’s reliance on Russian energy. The report said that together, the committed provisions for the clean energy transition and emissions reduction are close to €300 billion.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey proprietary database of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 11 American oil stocks. These oil stocks have solid fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. The list is ranked in an ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Best American Oil Stocks To Buy Now11. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Ranking 11th on the list of the best American oil stocks, Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is a New York-based company that is involved in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. In early December, Hess (NYSE:HES) declared a $0.375/share quarterly dividend, in line with the previous. A total of 33 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The total value of these stakes is $1.22 billion.In December, Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai upped the price target for Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) to $155 from $145 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The update came after the company posted Q3 results.10. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is a major American energy company that performed exceptionally well in 2022. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) gained about 60% over the past 12 months. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) is also a dividend payer, with over a 3% dividend yield as of January 9. Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) plans to cut its debt in the coming months. As of the end of the third quarter, the refiner’s debt came in at $5.6 billion. During the third quarter earnings call, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)’s management said that it has been working in the “right direction” since its debt to market cap ratio is 24.5% as of the end of Q3, compared to 40% during the COVID crisis.9. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a Texas-based company that accounts for a major portion of the world's hydraulic fracturing operations. In December, Raymond James gave a Strong Buy rating to the oil services company. The firm believes that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is expected to profit amid a favorable macro backdrop for the oil services industry. Raymond James’ James Rollyson said in a note to investors that “a sustained period of underinvestment during an exceptionally weak macro environment coupled with rising energy transition pressures set up the current oil supply situation.” Based on this thesis, the investment firm thinks the oil services industry will enjoy free cash flow generated for a “sustained period” because limited new capacity in the industry provides for an extended period of strong margins.Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides energy, engineering and construction services and is a manufacturer of products for the energy industry. The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Halliburton operates two business segments: Completion &amp; Production and Drilling &amp; Evaluation.Our conviction in longer-term operating leverage is supported by the focus on improving cost structures. Upstream oil and gas spending over the longer term can benefit Exploration &amp; Production (E&amp;P) firms from sustained high oil and gas prices and a renewed urgency in global energy security. We believe the rightsizing of the company’s cost structure and forward focus on margins at the same time as E&amp;Ps respond to new investment signals will drive both topline and bottom-line growth.”8. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is an American oil company that is a part of the Fortune 500 list. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a high dividend stock, with an 11% yield as of January 9.

The most notable of these stakeholders include Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management ($188 million) and John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors ($135 million stake).Back in October, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend by 12.5%.6.

It is worth considering Valero Energy (VLO), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.This oil refiner has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.56%.For the last reported quarter, Valero Energy came out with earnings of $7.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7 per share, representing a surprise of 2%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $9.70 per share and it actually produced earnings of $11.36 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.11%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Valero Energy lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Valero Energy has an Earnings ESP of +3.51% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years. The S&amp;P 500 Index is a primary stock market benchmark for the broader market. It tracks the performance of about 500 large-cap companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. Although the S&amp;P 500 ended the last trading day of 2022 with a sharp decline on the back of high inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, and accelerating concerns of a recession, it might be a good idea to look back at the historical performance of the index and see how it has fared on average. It is very rare for the S&amp;P 500 to report consecutive losses for years in a row, but when it does occur, historically the second year is more painful than the first. This means that equities could be in for greater pain in 2023 as compared to 2022. Investment advisory UBS mentioned in its 2023 outlook note: ""History shows that growth and earnings continue to deteriorate into market troughs before financial conditions ease materially.""2023 is a year to navigate the stock market carefully and be selective with portfolios. Bruce Helmer, co-founder of Wealth Enhancement Group, told CBS News on January 5 that although the economic uncertainty prevails, China is beginning to ease up on its COVID Zero policies, which suggests that there are reasons for optimism. JPMorgan expects the market to ""re-test"" the lows of 2022 in the first half of 2023, however, the stock market could rebound later in the year. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, some market experts are highlighting longer-term historical patterns to reassure investors that bear markets eventually come to an end. As per Commonwealth Financial Network’s 2023 forecast, citing data from JPMorgan Asset Management: ""Keep in mind also that from 1980 to the present, annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 were positive in 32 of 42 years despite intra-year declines averaging 14 percent.""Story continuesIn this scenario, investors should stick with stable companies that have fortress balance sheets, a loyal customer base, widespread operations, and market visibility. These factors allow such firms to survive economic volatility better than others. While investors often look to buy solid equities at a discount (see 11 Best Buy-the-Dip Stocks To Invest In), it is a good idea to watch out for stocks which have a history of positive share price gains. These stocks are likely to have positive industry dynamics behind their backs, which are underappreciated by the market, and may continue to outperform the market. Some of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in the last five years include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Our Methodology We selected the 12 S&amp;P 500 constituents that have posted significant share price gains over the last five years as of January 6. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds to assess the hedge fund sentiment around these equities. The list is arranged according to the share price returns of each firm. 12 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 YearsCopyright: wolandmaster / 123RF Stock PhotoBest Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years12.

Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. UnitedHealth’s (NYSE:UNH) earnings were resilient.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.5 million shares worth $742 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc.

(NYSE:NEE) is an integrated utility business with a regulated utility operating in Florida and the largest wind business in the U.S. NextEra’s regulated business includes Florida Power &amp; Light, which serves nine million people in Florida. NextEra’s share price rose along with the passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which considerably expands support for renewable energy.”10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 745-Year Share Price Gains as of January 6: 122.65%Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices worldwide.

Heading into 2023, the analyst expects semiconductor investor focus to shift to finding a ""bottom in both fundamentals and share prices."" He believes the latest meaningful rally in the group is premature given the potential of ongoing fundamental weakness and therefore forecasts a ""superior opportunity to become more constructive to emerge later in 2023.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was part of 74 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 66 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent position holder in the company, with over 1 million shares worth $469 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers specifically said about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Tech stocks, including Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), were one of the hardest-hit sectors due to fears over a weakening macroeconomic environment. Broadcom, however, outperformed semiconductor peers as its end-market exposures provided relatively more defensive characteristics.”9.

In the pandemic recession of 2020, the aggregate earnings of the portfolios we manage did not decline year-over-year, and in fact grew, albeit modestly. Looking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. During this same period, Mastercard’s (NYSE:MA) earnings almost tripled.""8. T-Mobile US, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”7. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2695-Year Share Price Gains as of January 6: 151.04%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide.

Dan Loeb’s Third Point is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.70 million shares worth $697.3 million. In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is one of the premier S&amp;P 500 stocks to monitor. Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years.  Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nuclear Energy Companies in the World15 Best Sin Stocks To Buy15 Most Valuable Silicon Valley Companies Disclosure: None. 12 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 5 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
350,37046d1b-a2f2-38f6-991d-7f2ee16ba410,UNH,2023-01-11,UnitedHealth (UNH) to Post Q4 Earnings: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-unh-post-q4-earnings-144102310.html,1673361662,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH is set to report its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 13, before the opening bell.The healthcare plan provider reported adjusted earnings of $5.79 per share for the last quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.2% on the back of sustained membership growth in its UnitedHealthcare business. Strong expansion in value-based arrangements at the Optum Health segment contributed to the upside. However, the positives were partly offset by elevated operating costs.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $5.17 suggests a 15.4% increase from the prior-year figure of $4.48 while our estimate indicates a 14.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $82.8 billion indicates a 12.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate suggests 12.6% year-over-year growth.UnitedHealth beat the consensus estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters, with the average being 4.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteFactors to NoteUnitedHealth’s fourth-quarter results are expected to be boosted by higher premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from premiums is pegged at $64,332 million, indicating an increase from $57,547 million a year ago while our estimate suggests a 12.8% year-over-year increase. Solid domestic commercial benefit insurance sales are likely to have aided premium growth.The consensus mark for product revenues is pegged at $9,579 million, signaling a jump from $8,961 million a year ago while our estimate suggests 5.9% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for services is pegged at $7,672 million, indicating an increase from the year-ago figure of $6,422 million while our estimate suggests a 21.8% year-over-year jump.Story continuesRevenues from UnitedHealthcare, UNH’s largest segment that sells insurance, are likely to have risen on higher membership in the Community &amp; State programs. As such, the consensus mark for UnitedHealthcare revenues  indicates 10.3% growth from the year-ago period while our estimate signals a 10.9% year-over-year rise.The Optum business segment is expected to have witnessed a higher contribution from the sub-segments, OptumHealth and Optum Insight, in the fourth quarter. A rise in the number of people being catered to in value-based care arrangements and the growing strength of affiliated physicians is likely to aid the results. Optum Insight is likely to have witnessed higher profits, owing to growth in services and technology offerings and improved productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment is pegged at $3,901 million, signaling a 14.1% jump from $3,420 million in the prior-year quarter while our estimate suggests an 11.4% year-over-year increase. This is expected to have led to a year-over-year rise in the bottom line.However, UnitedHealth is likely to have faced an elevated expense level due to a rise in medical and operating costs. Higher costs of products sold are likely to have reduced its margins. Our estimates for medical and operating costs indicate 11.6% and 11.1% year-over-year increases, respectively. This is likely to have affected its profit levels in the fourth quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.79%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $5.13 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.17.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for UnitedHealth, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Adicet Bio, Inc. ACET has an Earnings ESP of +4.27% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Adicet’s earnings per share for the to-be-reported quarter has improved 4.8% in the past 60 days.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) - 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”brand, company, name, beauty, care, industry, ladies, package, skicare, cox, cream,Christopher Elwell / Shutterstock.comThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand.As a result, The Macerich Company’s MAC portfolio of premium assets in the United States, with a notable presence in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and the Metro New York to Washington, DC corridor, has been experiencing solid leasing activity.Amid this, Macerich noted that it has made continued progress in addressing its debt maturities and carried out three transactions totaling just under $1.4 billion. These financing moves have helped enhance the company’s liquidity position, poising it well for long-term growth.On Jan 3, 2023, the company closed a five-year refinancing worth $370 million of the previous combined loans totaling $363 million. These loans formerly encumbered Green Acres Mall and Green Acres Commons in Valley Stream, NY, both of which were set to mature in first-quarter 2023.The new loan, which is interest only during the entire loan term, bears a fixed interest rate of 5.90% and going to mature on Jan 6, 2028.In early December 2022, MAC completed a three-year extension of its $300 million loan on Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica, CA. The extended loan is now set to mature on Dec 9, 2025, inclusive of the extension options and carries a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.48%.Further, this retail REIT’s joint venture that owns Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, AZ, is in the process of refinancing the existing $405 million mortgage loan. The new five-year loan with a fixed rate is expected to be $700 million and is likely to generate around $150 million of additional liquidity for Macerich. This loan is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2023.It may be noted that in October 2022, Macerich announced plans for the next phase of the ongoing reinvestment in the company’s iconic Scottsdale Fashion Square, encompassing 1.9 million square feet. The move will provide the company an opportunity to capitalize on the expenditure trend of affluent customers and generate decent cash flows.With added balance-sheet strength and a well-laddered debt maturity profile, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. As of Nov 3, it had more than $615 million of liquidity.Also, Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance the overall quality of its portfolio highlights its prudent capital-management practices and releases the pressure off its balance sheet.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 32.9% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 18.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption, stiff competition from industry peers and rising interest rates remain key concerns for the company.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Stag Industrial STAG and National Retail Properties NNN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

362,6836d878-0dfa-3311-8b89-b13339246b12,AAL,2023-01-11,15 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-lgbtq-friendly-companies-135943554.html,1673359183,STORY,"['KO', 'HAS', 'IBM', 'SBUX', 'V', 'AAL', 'ACN', 'WMT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in the US. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most LGBTQ Friendly Companies in the US.Go back a few decades and the LGBTQ movement didn't even exist. According to many historians, the start of the modern gay rights movement took place in 1965 in Philadelphia. Despite this early interest, few inroads were made regarding LGBTQ movements even globally. While the common goal between most such movements has been for social equality for LGBTQ communities, even partial success has taken decades to achieve, and has largely been limited to developed countries. Even in 2021, there are just 31 countries in the world which recognize same-sex marriages, and legalization of same-sex marriages has not signified the end of the vast discrimination that most LGBTQ members face. In fact, the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001, just 21 years ago. Pre-2000, not a single country allowed same sex marriage and yet, these countries now lambast those who haven't made such progress, just because the progress has not been according to their timelines.Of course, this is not to say that great advancements haven't been made in this case. Even a few years ago, coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community was nothing less than a death sentence to one's social standing or even one's career. This is why people such as Ellen DeGeneres have been rightly lauded for coming out as a lesbian in 1997, when acceptance was nowhere near as widespread as it is today, and still managed to have an incredible career. In other areas such as sports, it is still much harder to come out as toxic stereotypes and lack of acceptance prevail in sports. In June 2022, a study revealed that the majority of abused suffered by footballers consisted of homophobia, as traditional beliefs prevail that sports are for ""manly"" people. The first gay professional player in Australia, Any Brennan, only came out in 2019, just to emphasize how recent the phenomenon of acceptance is and how there is still a lack of people who feel comfortable coming out.Story continues15 most LGBTQ friendly companies in USlazyllama/Shutterstock.comOf course, in developing countries, especially those where the majority of people are religious, acceptance of the LGBTQ community basically does not exist. Islam, the second-most dominant religion in the world, in terms of number of followers, is strictly against homosexuality of any kind, which is why in many Muslim countries, homosexuality isn't just illegal, it is often punishable by death. While there are more than a dozen countries which prescribe the death penalty for homosexual activity, there is little evidence of executions taking place in most such countries. However, that doesn't mean that the LGBTQ community can live safely, as repression and extrajudicial killings can be carried out, while you will definitely be discriminated against and acceptance is just a pipe dream for now.On the other hand, many developed countries, especially in the West, have passed laws forbidding any discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, especially in places of work. Most multinational companies based in the West enforce policies enforcing that no discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is acceptable in any case. This helps spread this idea in countries where laws and regulations are not in favor of the LGBTQ community that their acceptance is important. Nowadays, as LGBTQ acceptance grows, companies are much more vocal in their support as well, especially as the majority of young adults believe that business owners should not be allowed to refuse service to LGBTQ people.Nowadays, companies aren't just judged based on their financial performance; Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is one of the most important considerations when judging a company's success. LGBTQ is an important part of the ""social"" aspect of ESG, and diversity and inclusion can now often be seen among the primary objectives of many companies, especially if these companies are multinationals. While many companies may be doing it just for lip service, it is undoubtable that focusing on diversity and inclusion is beneficial to the company too. According to a report by McKenzie, companies who have greater diversity within their ranks have a 25% better chance of bettering the financial performance of their competitors. Meanwhile, a Credit Suisse study also identified positive correlation between LGBTQ diversity and the financial performance of a company when considering a basket of 270 companies which support LGBTQ diversity.Currently, there are hundreds if not thousands of countries globally which have focused heavily on LGBTQ rights. For the most LBGTQ friendly companies in the US, we consulted various similar lists especially focusing on companies mentioned by the Human Rights Campaign foundation, to come up with our own. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the companies doing the most to promote a cause which has been ignored for far too long, starting with number 15:15. Ernst &amp; Young LLPOne of the biggest financial services firms in the world, Ernst &amp; Young LLP has published researched on how companies need to do more to be inclusive to LGBTQ communities and the ways to do that.14.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)One of the biggest software companies in the world, has consistently provided donations to LGBTQ non-profit organizations. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also released an Xbox Pride controller, which you can decide whether its a capitalist twist on LGBTQ support or genuine support.12. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL)One of the largest airlines in the world, American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) was the first major U.S. airlines to protect LGBTQ members among its employees by including sexual orientation and gender identity in its workplace nondiscrimination policies. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) created a dedicated ""Rainbow Team"" to implement LGBTQ policies in the company in 1993 after a fax was leaked to new outlets where an employee requested changing pillows and blankets because of activists returning from a gay march in Washington.11.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has faced some flack in the way it treats its employees, including being against unions. However, it cannot be argued that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been involved a lot in LGBTQ rights for more than three decades.9. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)The largest company in the world by revenue, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also the largest private employer in the U.S. with more than 2 million employees which is why Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) support for the LGBTQ community matters a lot. Walmart Inc.

This consideration consists of $2.44 million in cash and 368,383 shares of common stock valued at around $5.36 million.Will Taking Full Control of PERC Help?Consolidated Water acquired controlling interest of PERC in fourth-quarter 2019 and has since strengthened PERC’s capabilities and resources, resulting in strong financial performance, exceeding expectations.PERC’s strong operating performance, revenue growth and profitability, as well as its synergies with other areas of CWCO’s business and future growth prospects, are going to boost CWCO’s performance. So given the past performance and present prospects of PERC, it is quite evident that acquiring the remaining 39% of PERC will improve CWCO’s performance.In October 2022, PERC was awarded an expanded 10-year, $49.2 million contract to operate and maintain two advanced water treatment facilities in Southern California, which will surely boost earnings of CWCO.Acquisition is Helping Water IndustryAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently providing water solutions to customers.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for the upgrade of infrastructure and the continuation of high-quality services to customers. American Water Works continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Other water utilities like American Water Works AWK, SJW Group SJW and Essential Utilities WTRG in the water utility space are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.American Water Works has been making strategic acquisitions to expand its operations. As of Sep 30, 2022, through 15 closed acquisitions, the company added 65,300 customers to its existing customer base. AWK’s pending acquisitions (as of Sep 30, 2022), when completed, will add another 21,600 customers to the customer base.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Water Works' 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 4.9% and 7.1%, respectively. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.66%.SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.8%.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first nine months of 2022, WTRG completed two acquisitions, which added 19,175 customers. Essential Utilities plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Essential Utilities’ long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.2%. The current dividend yield of the company is 2.4%.

It is worth considering PepsiCo (PEP), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry.This food and beverage company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7%.For the last reported quarter, PepsiCo came out with earnings of $1.97 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 per share, representing a surprise of 6.49%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.73 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.86 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.51%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PepsiCo lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 9, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PEP Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $6.76.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:REGN) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-110035714.html,1673434835,STORY,['REGN'],"[With its stock down 7.1% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:25% = US$5.4b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 25%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. As a result, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' remarkable 35% net income growth seen over the past 5 years is likely aided by its high ROE.Story continuesWe then compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 28% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for REGN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

REGN were down 7.69% after the company announced that its lead drug Eylea sales were negatively impacted by a short-term shift to off-label use of Roche’s RHHBY Avastin (bevacizumab).On a preliminary basis, sales of Eylea in the fourth quarter came in at $1.5 billion, down 3% year over year. For 2022, sales on a preliminary basis were $6.26 billion, up 8% year over year.Per Regeneron, sales in the fourth quarter were also impacted by the temporary closing of a fund that provides patient co-pay assistance.Regeneron’s lead drug, Eylea, approved for various ophthalmology indications, has been a consistent performer.We note that Roche’s Avastin is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but is used to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on an off-label basis.Regeneron is jointly developing aflibercept 8 mg with Bayer AG BAYRY. While REGN records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Regeneron had earlier announced that the two studies evaluating aflibercept 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens in patients with diabetic macular edema and wet AMD were successful. The company is evaluating a higher dose of aflibercept with less frequent injections in the targeted population. The biologics license application (BLA) was submitted in December 2022 and the company used a priority review voucher in connection with the submission. The successful label expansion will further propel sales and boost the top line.While Eylea has maintained momentum, competition is getting stiff for the drug and a slowdown in sales will impact growth.  In January 2022, Roche won FDA approval for Vabysmo (faricimab-svoa) to treat wet AMD and DME. Roche has designed Vabysmo to block pathways involving Ang-2 and VEGF-A. It has ongoing long-term extension studies for Vabysmo in people with nAMD and DME. The European Commission also approved Vabysmo (faricimab) for these indications.Story continuesRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRegeneron also announced that the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (DODAC) of the FDA met to discuss the proposed use of Eylea injection as a treatment for preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The DODAC provided advice to the FDA on appropriate communication and labeling of Eylea as a treatment for ROP in preterm infants. Regeneron is in alignment with the outcome of the discussion. The DODAC’s guidance will now be considered by the FDA in its review of the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for EYLEA in ROP, which was previously accepted for Priority Review and assigned a target action date of Feb 11, 2023.Regeneron’s shares have gained 9.6% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 18%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMeanwhile, Regeneron also earns its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent. Partner Sanofi SNY records global net product sales of Dupixent. Solid sales of Dupixent (approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis) have boosted the sales of the drug.Regeneron is also looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records global net product sales of Libtayo outside the United States and pays a royalty to Sanofi on such sales.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
