It has amassed assets over $19.53 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.45%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 43.30% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Telecom round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 13.94% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 54.97% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHG seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index is float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted and includes the large-cap growth portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.The ETF has gained about 35.93% so far this year and is up about 24.63% in the last one year (as of 09/20/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $54.19 and $78.02.The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 23.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 245 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $92.29 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $204.80 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s solid momentum across the China and international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. Notably, China commerce retail business is driven by rising online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall.Further, International retail business is riding on solid combined order growth. Moreover, strength across the Cainiao logistics services, owing to robust domestic consumer logistics and international fulfillment solution services is a plus.This apart, strength across cloud computing business and local services is a tailwind.

The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to rapidly growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.The company streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. TotalEnergies is steadily investing to expand its renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, the company’s production has been impacted by security-related production cuts in some regions. TotalEnergies remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.

The company has secured a solid production outlook, thanks to its decades of drilling inventories across its low-cost and diversified upstream asset base. The resource base represents the company’s strong footprint in prolific acres in the United States, comprising Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale.Also, the company is better positioned to rely on its strong balance sheet to withstand any adverse business scenario. However, due to the inflationary market, the company’s overall operating and production expenses continue to increase, hurting the bottom line.ConocoPhillips’ exploration and production activities are exposed to extreme volatility in oil and gas prices, making the overall business scenario of the upstream energy player extremely choppy.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Elevance Health, Inc.

3,bcc71733-d278-3331-b201-edfa87824e21,SCHW,2023-09-20,11 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for Retirees,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-vanguard-funds-buy-081834439.html,1695111514,STORY,"['VT', 'VTWAX', 'VTWIX', 'VTTSX', 'CTVA', 'AMZN', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'MSI', 'APH', 'SCHW', 'MSFT', 'O', 'NVDA', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'AAPL']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 11 best Vanguard funds to buy for retirees. To see more such funds, go directly to 5 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for Retirees.As millions of Americans approach retirement age, retirement planning is taking on ever greater significance. Every year, a substantial number of Baby Boomers retire, and concurrently, millennials are becoming more engaged in considering their own retirement. After all, the main income source for the majority of individuals is their job. Unless they possess substantial inheritance, it's essential to commence retirement planning right from the outset of their professional journey. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s Modern Wealth Survey, Americans now consider a minimum of $2.2 million as the threshold for wealth, surpassing the previous benchmark of $1 million. This same trend extends to retirement, where the target for a comfortable retirement has shifted from $1 million to $1.25 million over the years.Throughout 2021, the economy grappled with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to bounce back, various notable challenges cast uncertainty over the recovery. Inflation surged to levels not witnessed for many years, supply-chain disruptions tempered economic expansion, and a constrained labor market posed ongoing challenges for employers, exacerbated by a record number of employees either transitioning to new roles or exiting the workforce altogether. Another result of the COVID-19 pandemic's emergence was the increasing popularity of retirement among Americans. According to a New York Times report, many millennial workers aspire to retire in their 50s to pursue their personal interests. However, their financial circumstances appear to tell a different story. The report cited findings from Willis Towers Watson's Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, indicating that 36% of millennial workers in a broad range of industries were saving a mere 5% of their income, a sum insufficient to cover their living expenses during retirement. However, 52% of the respondents said they expected to retire before 65. The 2022 TIAA Retirement Insights Survey echoed these sentiments, reporting that 31 percent of individuals aged 30 to 39 expressed above-average confidence in their retirement planning capabilities. Among the younger millennial cohort, aged 25 to 29, confidence was even higher, with 40 percent believing they had an above-average level of competence in retirement planning.Story continuesHowever, despite this confidence, several Americans are falling short in their savings efforts, and a significant portion is failing to contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to receive the full employer match. According to a recent survey conducted by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, 64% of working individuals surveyed expressed confidence in their financial outlook for retirement. This represents a decrease from the 73% reported the previous year. Notably, only 18% of those surveyed expressed being ""very confident"" this year, down from the 30% reported in the previous year.Vanguard's How American Saves 2022 report provides insight on how Americans are building their retirement savings. In recent years, automatic savings features have seen a significant surge in popularity. By the close of 2021, 56% of Vanguard plans had embraced automatic enrollment, a trend especially notable in plans with over 1,000 participants, where 75% had adopted this approach. Additionally, Americans are increasingly favoring professionally managed accounts and services as they plan for retirement. By the end of 2021, an impressive 64% of all Vanguard participants had placed their investments solely in automatic investment programs, marking a substantial increase from the 7% reported at the end of 2004. Vanguard presents a range of target-date retirement funds, some of which are featured in our list. These funds have been steadily gaining traction. According to a Vanguard report, 56% of their participants had invested in a single target-date fund. Reflecting their growing appeal, the availability of target-date funds in plans increased to 95% by the end of 2021, compared to 84% in 2012.In spite of the aforementioned data, the United States boasts a thriving and robust retirement industry. According to McKinsey, the U.S. retirement market possesses an impressive $26 trillion in assets. This data unveils a remarkable forecast: by 2030, retirees are anticipated to make a greater contribution to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. The research conducted by McKinsey reveals that Defined Contribution, the largest segment within the retirement industry, constitutes approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion. These assets generate an impressive $30 billion in revenue for the managing firms, overseeing approximately 110 million accounts. Notably, the Defined Contribution industry has displayed consistent growth over the last decade.Lastly, a significant aspect of retirement pertains to the assisted living community sector, also referred to as old age homes. These establishments provide seniors with companionship and care during the latter phases of their lives. As outlined in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at approximately $91.8 billion in 2022, and is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within the market, the segment catering to individuals aged 85 and above claimed the largest market share in 2022. Looking ahead to 2040, the number of seniors in this age group is projected to more than double, increasing from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.11 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for RetireesPhoto by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we thoroughly examined Vanguard's selection of retirement-oriented funds and curated a list of 11 funds that are highly regarded for their safety and popularity among retirement experts and market analysts. The goal of this compilation is to offer a comprehensive selection of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Furthermore, we have highlighted the top holdings of these ETFs, wherever applicable, which include prominent companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), to provide deeper insights for potential investors. Lastly, these Vanguard ETFs have demonstrated remarkable growth over the past five years. The list is organized in ascending order based on their five-year performance as of September 14, 2023.11. Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 6.39%Positioned perfectly between income and growth, the Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX) aims to surpass the S&amp;Ps 500 Index, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both dividend income and potential stock price appreciation. Investors will gain exposure to leading stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).10. Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 12.55%Target-date funds like Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX) have been tailored with long-term investors in mind as they prepare for retirement. VSVNX, designed for young investors eyeing retirement around 2070, boasts a modest 0.08% expense ratio, translating to an annual fee of $8 on a $10,000 investment. This fund's primary objective is to achieve capital growth and current income in line with its current target allocation. It accomplishes this by gradually shifting its investments into a more conservative blend of Vanguard funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Stock Index Fund, Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Fund.9. Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 13.50%The Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX) is an excellent choice for younger investors who are comfortable with greater risk. This LifeStrategy fund is geared toward achieving long-term capital growth and maintains a fixed asset allocation, with roughly 80% invested in global stocks and 20% in global bonds. It's worth noting that VASGX does carry a slightly higher expense ratio of 0.14% in comparison to target-date funds and has a minimum investment requirement of $3,000.8. Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (NASDAQ:VTTSX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 21.02%Instead of fixating on a specific retirement year, Vanguard adopts a five-year timeframe – for instance, 2056 to 2060 in the instance of VTTSX. This approach renders the fund well-suited for a more adaptable retirement planning approach. As the target retirement date for each fund draws nearer, VTTSX offers investors diversification along with a gradual reduction in stock exposure and a corresponding increase in bond exposure.7. Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 27.34%The Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT) stands out as a top Vanguard retirement fund due to its comprehensive coverage of both developed and emerging markets. It is particularly appealing to investors seeking ETFs with minimal expense ratios, with the fund's expense ratio standing at just 0.07% as of February. Noteworthy among the ETF's holdings are significant companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).6. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 29.75%Opting for Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX) is a strong choice for bolstering the mid-cap stock segment of your investment portfolio, especially if you're aiming to expand your holdings across a broader spectrum of equities. According to an S&amp;P Global report, mid-cap stocks consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 for most of the 20-year period concluding on August 31, 2015. Some of the notable holdings within VIMAX's portfolio include Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI), Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), and Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O). Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for Retirees.Suggested articles:12 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in August11 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 5010 Best Quant ETFsDisclosure.

Currently, attrition levels are measurably better than what we communicated at the time we announced the acquisition in November 2019.

See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Texas Instruments is:48% = US$7.7b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.48 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Texas Instruments' Earnings Growth And 48% ROETo begin with, Texas Instruments has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 14% net income growth seen by Texas Instruments over the past five years.We then compared Texas Instruments' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 31% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is TXN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TXN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Texas Instruments Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 53% (or a retention ratio of 47%) for Texas Instruments suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Texas Instruments has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 61% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 43%.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Texas Instruments has some positive aspects to its business. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Semiconductor Market Share By Company: Top 5.Semiconductor Industry: An OverviewSemiconductors are the prime element powering a multitude of products around us, ranging from automotive to advanced generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has fuelled the demand for semiconductors, which are vital for smart devices and facilitate connectivity. Mckinsey has called semiconductors ""the unsung heroes of the technology world.""The semiconductor market size is growing rapidly. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $1.88 trillion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.28%. The Asia Pacific region is the most dominant semiconductor market and has been estimated to hold this position throughout the forecast period. In 2022, the Asia Pacific semiconductor market was valued at $230.5 billion. The presence of top-notch semiconductor companies in China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan greatly contributed to the region's distinction in the global market. North America and Europe have also been estimated to grow substantially during the forecast period. According to McKinsey, 70% of the future growth of the semiconductor industry would come primarily from three main industries: automotive, computation, and data storage and wireless industry—the automotive industry will account for almost 20% of the market expansion in the coming years. The surge in demand for electric vehicles is expected to also contribute to the semiconductor industry’s growth. Latest Trends And DevelopmentsThe semiconductor industry faced a massive shortage post-pandemic. The pandemic caused a drop in semiconductor demand for the automotive industry while simultaneously causing an upsurge in demand by the tech industry. According to McKinsey, auto sales declined as much as 80% in Europe in the early days of the pandemic, and as more people started working from home, there was a rising need for electronic devices. Story continuesThe automotive industry contracts usually have a shorter term focused on quick delivery of products. As a canon event, the drop in semiconductor demand by the automotive industry led to semiconductor companies signing longer-term contracts with other industries. Post-pandemic, when the automotive industry started recovering, the semiconductor industry was already bound in longer contracts delivering products to other industries. This difference caused a supply-demand imbalance, majorly contributing to the worldwide semiconductor shortage. Semiconductor companies are employing various strategies to combat semiconductor shortages. The companies have started nurturing ecosystem capabilities through collaboration and investments. On September 12, Reuters reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) will be investing almost $100 million in the initial public share offering (IPO) of Arm Holdings Plc. The chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has acknowledged the significance of Arm in the semiconductor ecosystem for both the technology and customers. The company wants Arm to be 'successful' and 'healthy.' Semiconductor companies are also building capacity through collaborations and partnerships. On September 5, Reuters reported that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has partnered with Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM). Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would provide foundry services to the company, which would then provide an investment of $300 million in Intel's New Mexico factory. The equipment to be installed in the New Mexico factory is going to be owned and acquired by Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM). This partnership will help Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) meet the growing demand as it would add 600,000 photo layers per month to its capacity. The companies are very positive about this collaboration, as expressed by the CEO of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM), who sees this collaboration as the first step in developing many ""unique synergistic solutions"" in the future.Another strategy that could help meet the soaring semiconductor demand while dominating the market is technology advancement by designing and manufacturing the most efficient products. On August 29, Reuters reported that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would launch a new data center chip named ""Sierra Forest"" next year. The chip will have a ""240% better performance per watt"" than the current generation of similar chips. The new data center chip will be more energy-efficient, enabling it to compete with other companies processing data chips like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).Semiconductor companies are also signing longer contracts to gain more stability and certainty of the future. On September 11, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has signed a deal to provide the tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with 5G chips. The deal will last till 2026 and would significantly benefit both companies. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be able to effectively cater to the supply chain challenges while QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) will earn billions of dollars. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had previously signed a deal with the company in 2019.Many semiconductor companies are competing to meet the growing product demand while staying ahead of their competitors.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 18.28%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.37 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.01%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.66%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.7%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.46 is up 15.9% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.21%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 19%, meaning it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.73 per share, with earnings expected to increase 24.48% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to the research, there is significant opportunity for investor education when it comes to gold investments, and advisors are playing an important role in helping clients understand its role in portfolios.The study found that lack of knowledge is the number one reason why, among the options provided, surveyed investors do not invest in gold, with more than a third indicating they do not have gold in their portfolio because they do not know enough about the ways they can invest in gold. Furthermore, only 41% of surveyed investors agree that they understand what influences the price of gold, compared to 75% among those who actually do have gold in their portfolios.When it comes to investing in gold ETFs, the advisors’ role as educator is critical. Nine out of 10 (91%) surveyed investors who own gold ETFs indicated they were informed by their financial advisor about the different ways to invest in gold. A similar percentage (91%) of surveyed investors indicated discussing an investment in gold with their financial advisors.""Investors have good instincts about where – and when – to get objective advice. But it’s likely they will need even more guidance to achieve their financial goals as markets continue to react to higher interest rates, lower consumer sentiment and stubborn inflation,"" said Allison Bonds, Head of Private and Independent Wealth Management at State Street Global Advisors.Story continuesAmong surveyed investors with a financial advisor and holding a gold ETF in their portfolio:91% have discussed investing in gold with their financial advisor compared with 36% of all surveyed investors with financial advisors;89% report their financial advisor has explained the benefits of having gold in their investment portfolio compared with 35% of all surveyed investors with financial advisors;83% noted that their financial advisor recommended gold for their long-term investment portfolio versus 26% of all surveyed investors with financial advisors; and55% reported their financial advisor recommended gold as a short-term investment given current markets compared to 17% of all surveyed investors with financial advisors.The survey also revealed approximately three in four gold ETF investors (73%) agree that gold ETFs have improved the performance of their investment portfolio, with three-fourths (76%) reporting that ETFs are a more cost-effective way to invest in gold.Notably, across all surveyed investors (advised and self-directed) those who hold gold ETFs are more likely to have investable assets of $500,000 or more (82%) than those surveyed investors who do not hold gold ETFs (64%).""Financial advisors can be an invaluable resource for investors seeking to preserve wealth and improve the diversification of their portfolio as they may be more knowledgeable about the unique attributes of gold and the role it can play in a portfolio,"" Bonds said. ""With the introduction of SPDR Gold Shares (GLD®) nearly two decades ago, and more recently SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM®) five years ago, access to gold has been democratized for every type of investor.""The top three variables surveyed gold ETF investors considered when buying a gold ETF are:Expense ratio (65%)A structure that is physically backed by gold (55%)Reputation of provider (48%)SPDR gold ETF assets under management have increased $2.9 billion year-to-date from $58.6 billion as of 12/31/22 to $61.5 billion as 8/31/23.1Advisors who understand what is behind this interest may be better positioned to educate their clients about the potential benefits and risks of investing in gold, and how gold can play multiple roles in one’s overall portfolio strategy.""We believe that better informed investors make better clients, as we believe that they’re less likely to invest in products they don’t understand, and we believe that they are less likely to panic when markets fluctuate over the short-term,"" added Bonds.Access the full study results here: Gold ETF Impact Study 2023.About State Street Global Advisors Gold ETF Impact StudyState Street Global Advisors, in partnership with A2Bplanning and Prodege, conducted an online survey among individual investors in the US.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.07%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.02%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.01%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had lost 3.17% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's loss of 1.58% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.38% in that time.Thermo Fisher Scientific will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Thermo Fisher Scientific is projected to report earnings of $5.66 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 11.42%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $10.65 billion, down 0.29% from the year-ago period.TMO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $22.37 per share and revenue of $43.54 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -3.74% and -3.07%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends.

CF, the world's largest ammonia producer, and POSCO Holdings Inc., South Korea's largest steelmaker with a strong presence in energy trading and power generation, have announced their collaboration on evaluating a joint venture. This venture aims to build a low-carbon clean ammonia plant within CF Industries' Blue Point Complex in Ascension Parish, LA, in the United States and establish a long-term supply of low-carbon clean ammonia to South Korea.As a crucial part of this project evaluation, CF Industries and POSCO will initiate a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study focused on autothermal reforming (ATR) ammonia production technology. The ATR technology, in conjunction with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), is expected to significantly reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the ammonia production process, achieving a reduction of over 90% compared to conventional ammonia plants without CCS. This reduction will enable the resulting low-carbon clean ammonia to meet the South Korean government's Clean Hydrogen Energy Portfolio Standard requirements.If the project proceeds as planned, POSCO intends to import this low-carbon clean ammonia from the facility in the United States to support the decarbonization efforts of its coal-based power generation facilities in South Korea. Furthermore, POSCO has plans to convert this low-carbon clean ammonia into hydrogen for use in gas-based power plants and steel-making processes, thus contributing to its broader sustainability goals.CF Industries is excited to partner with POSCO in their shared commitment to decarbonization, both for POSCO's initiatives and South Korea's broader sustainability objectives. POSCO's clear strategy to leverage low-carbon ammonia for expediting the decarbonization of its steel manufacturing and power generation sectors presents a substantial boost in demand for clean energy in the form of low-carbon ammonia.Story continuesFurthermore, the United States holds a strategic position within the POSCO Group's global agenda, particularly in its pursuit of establishing a robust and economically viable overseas network for the supply of hydrogen and ammonia. This endeavor aligns with the IRA support policy and aims to transform the United States into a pivotal production hub for clean ammonia. Collaborating with CF Industries will play a pivotal role in realizing this vision. The goal is to create a dependable supply network that can efficiently deliver clean hydrogen, essential for domestic power generation and the hydrogen reduction process in steelmaking.CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusCF Industries Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Quote The FEED study is anticipated to conclude in the second half of 2024, with CF Industries and POSCO making a final investment decision after that.Since 2020, CF Industries has been at the forefront of efforts to decarbonize its ammonia production network. The company is strategically positioned to provide substantial low-carbon clean ammonia in the coming years. Its initiatives include collaborating with ExxonMobil to construct a CO2 dehydration and compression facility at its Donaldsonville Complex, enabling the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year starting in 2025. Additionally, CF Industries is working with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. on a front-end engineering and design study to establish a greenfield low-carbon clean ammonia facility, employing steam methane reforming (SMR) ammonia technology combined with CCS at their Blue Point Complex in Louisiana. CF is also constructing North America's first commercial-scale green ammonia capacity at its Donaldsonville Complex, set to begin production of up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia in 2024.

Retailers, in general, are forecasted to only hire around 410,000 employees over the coming holiday season, a 15-year low.Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, Inc. SVP and Head of Sales Andrew Challenger attributes the decline in seasonal hiring to labor market forces and inflation pressures.“But, we’re not hearing quite the scramble that we’ve heard the last three years,” Challenger says of tightening hiring trends seen in the early pandemic period.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Amazon announcing it's hiring 250,000 employees throughout the US. Out of those positions, 30,000 will be across California for seasonal workers. However, according to a recent report by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, it might not be a very jolly holiday season for retail hiring. Amid a cooling labor market, holiday hiring is estimated to be the lowest since the financial crisis. Firms in the sector are only expected to add 410,000 positions in the fourth quarter.So where does this leave retailers as the holiday season approaches? Here to discuss we have Challenger, Gray, &amp; Christmas Senior Vice President Andy Challenger. So Andy, not very jolly. What are the reasons for that?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. We are expecting the retail sector to just hire fewer people than we have the past few years. Part of that is an overall trend. We've saw kind of peak hiring in the retail sector in 2016. And it's been slowly coming down since then, although we saw a spike during COVID.And then we're also expecting the slowing inflation is going to make it difficult for employers to pass on the extra costs of employees on to consumers in the form of increased prices. And it's going to put some crunch on the labor piece of the equation for these companies.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Andrew, let's kind of separate the big retailers that we've been looking at. We talked about Amazon hiring up. Amazon, Walmart, the big box names, so to speak, are kind of the ones where we see the ramp up happen. How do the numbers there you're anticipating compare to years past?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. We are expecting it to be lower this year. Last year, we saw it drop down to about 500,000 jobs added in the holiday hiring spree at the end of the year. That was down significantly from 2001 and to 2020 when we were in the midst of a real labor shortage in the sector. While there has been tightness that's persisted there, we really saw employers didn't need quite as many people last year in a surprising way. And then this year, amid just generally cooling labor market now for a number of months, we expect that to fall even further.JOSH LIPTON: And so Andrew so pending some of this on, I guess, it sounds like the cooling labor market. Also, how much does this really come down to higher interest rates as well? How much did that play into this, do you think?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. I really think that is part of it. When I talk to HR leaders, when I talk to companies, they are feeling the crunch in the people part of the equation of their companies right now. Labor costs have gotten much higher over the last few years. We've been in a real labor shortage. Companies hired at a very quick pace for a period of time.But the labor market has continued to cool in step with a cooling overall economy. We've seen month after month of that now. And while we think it has slowed, the cooling slowed a little bit the last two or three months, we do expect it to pick back up as companies get come to this conclusion that they're not going to be able to pass on all of those extra labor costs to consumers in increased prices.AKIKO FUJITA: So what's the outlook going into what is typically the busiest shopping season of the year?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. There's still going to be hiring that's happening. 400,000 jobs isn't nothing. And this announcement from Amazon was a big surprise to the upside. Since we put out this report, last year, they had only announced 150,000 people they were trying to hire, so 250,000 is a big increase. There are certainly going to be players there are hiring to their payrolls during the holiday season. They need extra help. Retailers will certainly be doing some extra hiring.But we're not hearing quite the scramble that we heard the last three years with companies offering no interview positions, hearing back from applications within 30 minutes, because it was so competitive. That atmosphere seems to have cooled this season.JOSH LIPTON: All right. Not very jolly. Andrew Challenger, we thank you for your time, sir.ANDREW CHALLENGER: Thanks for having me.]"

However, it hired 40,000 seasonal workers in 2022.Amazon's boost in hiring comes after it added 50 new fulfillment centers, delivery stations and same-day delivery in the United States, and as it prepares for its expanded fall Prime Event, scheduled for Oct. 10-11.During Amazon's Prime Event, the e-commerce giant is encouraging its merchants to offer discounts, a strategy that could prompt some frugal shoppers to open their wallets and splurge on gifts well ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping days.Amazon's seasonal hiring includes full-time, part-time and seasonal fulfillment employees, it said.New seasonal workers hired to pick, sort, pack and ship orders will get a sign-on bonuses between $1,000 and $3,000 in select locations, compared to associates who received $3,000 bonuses in 2022 and 2021 in some locations, it said.Story continuesAmazon said it will pay its seasonal workers $17 to $28 per hour on average depending on their jobs and locations, compared to the $19 hourly wage workers were offered last year.The Seattle-based e-retailer said it will invest $1.3 billion for pay increases for fulfillment and transportation workers this year.""A fulfillment or transportation employee who starts with us today will see a 13% increase in pay over the next three years —likely more, including our annual wage investments,"" John Felton, Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement.Amazon earlier this year laid off 27,000 staffers, or about 9% of its workforce, in its advertising, cloud computing and human resources departments following a string of tech lay offs.

M is taking strides to ensure a delightful shopping experience as it announces the commencement of seasonal hiring for the 2023 holiday season. As the festive season draws near, Macy's is gearing up to cater to the heightened shopping frenzy by bringing on board more than 38,000 full and part-time seasonal associates across its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, along with its distribution centers.The significance of the holiday season for retailers cannot be overstated. This period marks a crucial juncture, often accounting for a substantial portion of annual sales. The influx of enthusiastic shoppers provides retailers with the opportunity to showcase their offerings, boost revenues and solidify brand loyalty. Retailers leverage this period to not only maximize sales but also leave an indelible impression on consumers.To cater to prospective candidates, Macy's offers a streamlined online application process, which takes as little as five minutes, with most job offers extended within 48 hours. In addition, the company is hosting nationwide in-person holiday hiring events on Sep 21 and Oct 19, providing convenient opportunities for potential hires.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne of the standout features of Macy's hiring initiative is its commitment to competitive compensation. Many positions start at a minimum of $15 per hour, ensuring that seasonal workers are fairly rewarded for their efforts. Furthermore, employees can enjoy instant access to earned wages and flexible scheduling options that accommodate their availability.Macy's also values its employees' contributions and offers merchandise discounts as well as enticing referral bonuses of up to $500 for every successful recruit. With various incentive programs in place, colleagues have the chance to earn additional income during the holiday season.Wrapping UpMacy's strategic move to bolster its workforce for the upcoming holiday season not only ensures smooth operations but also underscores the pivotal role this period plays in the retail landscape.However, market analysts are skeptical about whether the upcoming holiday season will meet retailers' expectations. They believe that cautious consumer spending, influenced by diminishing household savings and ongoing economic uncertainties, could potentially hinder the season's performance.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have fallen 31.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 11.8%.Story continues3 Stocks Hogging in the LimelightHere we have highlighted some better-ranked stocks, namely Boot Barn Holdings BOOT, Ross Stores ROST and Walmart WMT.Boot Barn Holdings, a leading lifestyle retailer of western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This led to a weak year-over-year performance in second-quarter fiscal 2024.  Adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share declined 54% from the $1.86 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales fell 4.6% year over year to $375 million for the quarter under review. Comparable store sales (comps) fell 7.3%.As a result, the company retained its drab fiscal 2024 view. Hibbett expects year over year sales to remain flat to up 2% compared with the prior mentioned mid-single-digit growth for fiscal 2024, including the impacts of the 53rd week. Meanwhile, we expect the metric to grow 0.2%. It anticipates a comparable sales decline of low-single digits against earlier mentioned low-single-digit growth.The company expects in-store comps to decline year over year in the low-single digits, which compares unfavorably with the previous guidance of flat to low-single-digit growth and our estimate of a 2.6% decline. Meanwhile, e-commerce is anticipated to decline in the low-single-digit range, down from the prior stated high-single-digit growth. Earnings are anticipated to be $7-$7.75, down from the earlier mentioned $9.50-$10.00 per share but in sync with our estimate of $7.25.Also, a lower average product margin from higher promotional activity across footwear and apparel dented margins in the said quarter. Gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 32.8% while operating margin contracted 410 bps to 4.3% for the reported quarter.The company has been reeling under higher costs for essential items like food, utilities and gas, resulting in reduced discretionary spending. The current environment also remains challenging due to economic uncertainty and selective consumer spending. Persistent inflation has continued to affect consumer sentiment and spending patterns, which, in turn, led to increases in operating costs, including higher wages and prices for various goods and services.Fiscal 2024 SG&amp;A, as a percent of net sales, is estimated to be 23.3-23.5%, up from the previously mentioned 23.2-23.3%. Also, interest expenses, as a percentage of net sales, are projected to be 0.4-0.45%, up from the prior mentioned 0.25-0.3%.In second-quarter fiscal 2024, inventory rose 17.6% year over year to $430.8 million due to product cost inflation and an unfavorable mix. Management expects a continued promotional environment and muted consumer spending, at least in the third quarter. It also predicts year-over-year inventory to remain volatile due to supply-chain challenges.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of this company have lost 32.1% in the year-to-date period against the industry's 2.9% growth.Efforts to AidDespite these downsides, a strong start to the busy back-to-school season at the end of the fiscal second quarter is a sign of relief for HIBB.  Also, positive customer response to product launches, stemming from compelling product assortment and market share gains, bodes well. The company continues to benefit from strength across Hibbett and City Gear Brands.HIBB is focused on increasing its customer base by connecting with more customers through e-commerce and selective store expansion. Further, it is leveraging its omni-channel capabilities, such as home delivery, buy online and pick-up in store, reserve online and pick-up in store, buy online ship to store facility, same-day delivery and mobile app services, to fulfill online orders and serve customers. Hibbett is progressing well with its loyalty program in order to enhance its omni-channel initiatives.Also, the company continues to strengthen its presence across the country. The company has a target of growing to more than 1,500 stores in underserved markets. In second-quarter fiscal 2024, it opened five stores. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans to open 40-50 stores.ConclusionAlthough inflation-related headwinds are likely to linger in the short term, we believe that Hibbett’s store expansion efforts, online strength and a positive back-to-school season will help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock get back on track.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIBB’s fiscal 2024 earnings has inched up 0.8% in the past 30 days. The PEG ratio for Hibbett is just 0.77, far lower than the industry average of 1.31. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, HIBB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Topping it, a Value Score of A reflect its inherent strength.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks are BJ's Restaurants BJRI, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.BJ's Restaurants, which operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This led to sales at U.S. retailers surging in August, the Commerce Department said on Aug 14.Given this situation, investing in retail stocks like Ross Stores, Inc. ROST, Walmart Inc. WMT, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF and Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN will be a wise decision.Retail Sales Jump in AugustThe Commerce Department said that retail sales totaled $697.6 billion in August, increasing 0.6% month over month and beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.1%. This follows a 0.5% rise in retail sales in July.On a year-over-year basis, retail sales jumped 2.5% in August. Total sales for the June through August 2023 period increased 2.2% year over year.One of the major reasons behind the jump in August was sales at gas stations as fuel prices skyrocketed. However, even then consumers spent lavishly on apparel and eating out.Clothing and accessories sales increased 0.9% in August while spending at gas stations jumped 5.2%.Understandably, Americans are not hesitant about spending despite higher prices and inflationary pressure. That said, inflation has sharply declined over the past year and more than halved from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022.The steady rise in retail sales also proves that the economy is on a strong footing. Given the sharp decline in inflation, optimism is also high about the Fed keeping its interest rates unchanged in its September FOMC, which begins on Sep 19. Lower interest rates definitely bode well for the retail sector.Our ChoicesGiven the encouraging economic environment and an increase in retail sales, it would be a prudent move for savvy investors to consider betting on retail stocks that stand to benefit directly from these favorable conditions.Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

JWN has been witnessing decelerating demand trends due to reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment. This has been hurting the company’s top-line performance across both banners. Additionally, the wind-down of the Canada business has been weighing on its performance.Furthermore, the company’s decision to eliminate store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack’s digital orders, effective from the third quarter of fiscal 2022, has been hurting sales for the banner.Driven by these headwinds, Nordstrom expects the total revenues to decline 4-6% year over year in fiscal 2023. Revenues are expected to include a 250-bps impact of the closing of the Canada operations and a nearly 130-bps gain from the 53rd week.The impacts of the ongoing headwinds are also well reflected in the company’s share price. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 25% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 5.6%. Additionally, the stock has lagged the sector and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 8.2% and 14.5%, respectively. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Is There a Scope for Comeback?Although muted demand and reduced discretionary spending are looming concerns for Nordstrom, the company is leaving no stone unturned to get back on track. Its efforts to improve the Nordstrom Rack performance, advance inventory productivity and supply-chain optimization bode well.Nordstrom has been trying to drive efficiency and improve customer experience via faster order fulfillment. It is also on track to reduce inventory and optimize product mix. Increased focus on the Nordstrom Rack banner, driven by strategic brand penetration increases, bodes well. With an improved assortment and more new stores, Nordstrom Rack’s performance is expected to sequentially improve throughout 2023. The Rack banner is also on track to increase productivity throughout its network, decrease transportation costs, reduce delivery times and enhance services via faster delivery.Nordstrom Rack reduced store-based order fulfillment and raised the minimum order amount for free ship-to-store delivery on rack.com. These actions led to fewer order cancellations, simplified rack operations and improved profitability. Going ahead, it continues focusing on introducing more premium brands at Rack, better assortments and increased brand awareness. Driven by these factors, it expects to optimize the Rack product mix by mid-2023.Nordstrom has been making efforts to enhance customer experience through faster delivery, especially during its Anniversary sale. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, variable supply-chain costs fell more than 100 basis points for the fourth consecutive quarter, which, in turn, led to overall SG&amp;A deleverage. This supply-chain optimization work began in early 2022 and has delivered significant customer benefits and operational efficiencies. Supply-chain costs per unit in the second quarter fell 5% year over year due to inflation.Going ahead, JWN continues seeking additional efficiencies in flow and improved productivity through inventory management initiatives.The company is focused on its long-term strategy based on its market strategy to capitalize on its digital-first platform to better serve customers, gain market share and deliver profitable growth. For this, it is focused on three areas — winning in the most important markets, expanding the reach of Nordstrom Rack and enhancing its digital velocity. It is focused on the closer-to-you strategy, which aims to link stores and services to expedite deliveries, expanding online offerings and adding cheaper merchandise at its Rack off-price stores to improve customers' shopping experiences.As part of the strategy, Nordstrom earlier issued a long-term outlook. It predicted revenues to grow in the low-single digits on an annual basis, with operating income likely to outpace revenues in the long term. The EBIT margin is expected to be more than 6%, with the annual operating cash flow anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Capital expenditure is likely to be between 3% and 4% of sales.Additionally, going into fiscal 2023, management is focused on enhancing customer experience, improving the Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity and progressing in its supply-chain optimization initiatives. It is confident about the strength of its brands and its ability to drive profitable growth and deliver long-term value to shareholders.The company estimates the adjusted EBIT margin to be 3.7-4.2% of sales, which compares favorably with the prior-year reported figure of 3.3%. Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $1.80-$2.20 per share, excluding the charges related to the Canada business wind-down. Earnings per share, including wind-down-related charges, are expected between 60 cents and $1.00.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Urban Outfitters URBN.Abercrombie, a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

XYL is backed by multiple tailwinds despite the adverse impacts of cost inflation and softness in the Applied Water segment due to weakness in the residential end market.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Business Strength: Resiliency across the utilities and industrial water applications end markets augurs well for Xylem. The Measurement &amp; Control Solutions (M&amp;CS) segment is benefiting from improving supply chains and strong demand for pipeline assessment services. For 2023, the company expects M&amp;CS segment’s organic revenues to increase approximately 20%. Growth in the developed and emerging markets is boosting the Water Infrastructure segment’s performance. The company expects Water Infrastructure organic revenues to increase in the high-single digits in the current year.Strong price realization and backlog execution in the United States and emerging markets are key catalysts to the Applied Water segment’s growth. Strong industrial demand and recovery in China operations should foster the unit’s growth. For 2023, Xylem expects the segment’s organic revenues to increase in the mid-single digits.Xylem Inc. Price and ConsensusXylem Inc. Price and ConsensusXylem Inc. price-consensus-chart | Xylem Inc. QuoteHealthy Margin Performance: Higher volumes, productivity savings and pricing actions are supporting Xylem’s margins. The company’s adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 19.1% in the second quarter of 2023 compared with 16.6% in the year-ago period. For 2023, XYL expects adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, better than the previous expectation of 17.5-18%. Due to the essential nature of the business, demand remains robust. Strong growth in the United States, Western Europe and emerging markets is driving Xylem’s top line (up 20.3% year over year in the first half of 2023). Expansion Initiatives: Xylem believes in acquiring businesses/assets to expand its product offerings. The company acquired mission-critical water treatment solutions and services provider, Evoqua, in May 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle. The acquisition bolstered Xylem’s position in water technologies, solutions and services, and strengthened its foothold in lucrative end markets. The transaction is expected to deliver run-rate cost synergies of $140 million (out of which $40 million is expected by 2023-end) within three years upon closing. It is also expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet.Xylem has raised its 2023 guidance to include contributions from the Evoqua acquisition. The company now expects revenues of $7.2 billion ($1.1 billion expected from the Evoqua acquisition) in 2023, reflecting a 30% jump on a reported basis and 9-10% on an organic basis. Previously, the company anticipated total revenues to increase 8-9% on both organic and reported basis. XYL expects adjusted earnings of $3.50-$3.70 per share (45 cents expected from Evoqua acquisition) for 2023 compared with $3.15-$3.35 anticipated earlier. The company boosted its earnings guidance on strong demand and commercial and operational momentum.Rewards to Shareholders: Xylem’s commitment to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first six months of 2023, Xylem paid dividends of $139 million, up 26.4% year over year. The company also bought back shares worth $9 million in the same period. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapIs MGM Resorts International a Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with MGM Resorts International should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.81. These indicators suggest that MGM Resorts International, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: MGM Resorts InternationalMGM Resorts is the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip with 35,000 guest rooms and suites, representing about one fourth of all units in the market. The company's Vegas properties include MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, and Bellagio. The Strip contributed approximately 74% of total EBITDAR in 2022. MGM also owns U.S. regional assets, which represented 31% of 2022 EBITDAR (MGM's Macao EBITDAR was negative in 2022). MGM's U.S. sports and iGaming operations are currently a high-single-digit percentage of its total revenue. The company also operates the 56%-owned MGM Macau casinos with a new property that opened on the Cotai Strip in early 2018.

MGM and Caesars lost market value last week as stock prices fell, and MGM is yet to recover from various operations disrupted at the hotels and gaming venues it owns from Las Vegas to Macau.San Francisco-based Okta, which says it has more than 17,000 customers around the world, provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites. Multiple breaches it identified at its customers last month prompted the company to issue an alert then, Bradbury said.""We saw this happened in such a small period of time and we thought we should be coming forward to the industry at large and explaining what's happening here,"" he said.At the time, Okta said its U.S. customers were reporting a consistent pattern of attacks where hackers impersonated a victim firm's employees and convinced their information technology helpdesk into providing them duplicate access.""We've seen consistently over the past six to 12 months, a ramp up in these types of attacks,"" Bradbury said.MGM has not commented on the statement or the hack, beyond saying last week that it was dealing with a ""cybersecurity issue."" Caesars earlier said it was investigating the breach.Story continuesThe financially-motivated hacking group ALPHV claimed the MGM hack in a post on its website Friday, and warned MGM of further attacks if it didn't strike a deal. It's unclear how much ransom ALPHV has demanded.Bradbury said the group had breached into MGM and obtained access to its Okta client, which allowed it further access to more credentials in the identity management firm's system.Scattered Spider appears to have worked with ALPHV on the latest hacks, Bradbury said, citing research by security analysts who have tracked both groups. ""Think of them more as business associates or affiliates,"" he said.Google's Mandiant Intelligence last week called Scattered Spider, also known as UNC3944, as one of the most disruptive hacking outfits in the United States. Bradbury said Mandiant's description of the group's tactics aligned with what Okta had observed in the recent hacks. (Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco; Editing by Michael Perry)]"

The sector's outlook has been upgraded to positive by the analysts who also revised their ratings for Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) Group and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp.In the first half of 2023, international travel demand surged, driving a robust recovery for the cruise sector post-Covid. This trend significantly boosted cruise stocks with Carnival's stock leaping by 134%, Royal Caribbean witnessing a 110% increase, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings gaining 78%.However, the sector was downgraded to Neutral by Truist analysts in July as the stocks became excessively heated. Since that downgrade, Royal Caribbean's stock dipped by 15%, Carnival's by 23%, and Norwegian's by 25%.Despite these recent losses, Truist analysts now suggest that it might be an opportune time for investors to re-enter the sector. They anticipate strong bookings and pricing trends for 2024 and 2025. The team of analysts led by Patrick Scholes consider the consensus earnings estimates for these years to be overly cautious. They believe that it might not be until December that next year's guidance is provided by the companies.For Royal Caribbean, the analysts have raised their price target from $115 to $137, indicating a potential 43% increase from Monday’s closing price. Even though they have assigned a new Hold rating to Carnival, they view it as a relative underperformer. However, they find it challenging to justify a Sell rating as they expect all players in the sector to benefit from improving conditions. Norwegian Cruise Line stock continues to hold its rating.Last week, Redburn Atlantic analyst Alex Brignall also upgraded both Carnival and Norwegian to Buy from Neutral. He noted that cruise operators have made strides in repaying debt and enhancing profitability.

The analyst shifted his rating from 'sell' to 'hold', citing robust future booking trends and improved valuations due to a recent decrease in price. Scholes also slightly raised his stock price target for Carnival from $16 to $17.The analyst has maintained a bearish stance on Carnival for several years, but he noted that the European market shows the most potential for growth in 2024, a trend that favors Carnival due to its substantial presence in that region. However, Scholes refrained from adopting a bullish stance because of potential competition from privately owned MSC Cruises.In addition to Carnival, Scholes also upgraded his rating for Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) Group from 'hold' to 'buy'. This change mirrored an overall shift in his view of the cruise sector, which he upgraded from neutral to positive.On Tuesday, Carnival's shares rose by 1.6% in premarket trading, while Royal Caribbean's stock saw a 1.8% increase. This comes after a period of cooling off since the end of June when Carnival's shares dropped by 20.1%, Royal Caribbean's by 7.5%, and Norwegian Cruise's by 21.4%. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 index recorded a marginal increase of 0.1% during this time.Scholes explained that two months ago, despite strong booking trends, he felt the cruise stocks were overvalued after several months of significant outperformance. From March to June end, Carnival's stock saw an impressive rise of 85.5%, while shares of Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. increased by 58.9% and 61.9%, respectively.Despite this recent downturn, Scholes now recommends the cruise sector once again. He has maintained his neutral rating on Norwegian Cruise since July. The company's shares rose by 0.8% before Tuesday's market opening.Story continuesIn terms of industry fundamentals, Scholes noted that sales for 2024 are approximately 55% to 60% higher than the same period in 2019, pre-COVID. Sales for 2025 have doubled compared to 2019 levels. Although new supply for these years is estimated to be 20% to 25% higher than in 2019, demand continues to surpass supply. Consequently, Scholes argues that Wall Street's current consensus earnings predictions for 2024 and 2025 are overly cautious, especially concerning Royal Caribbean.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The Fair Work Commission will meet on Friday to decide whether to intervene and halt the strikes over pay and conditions which began on Sept. 8, and escalated to two 24-hour work stoppages over the weekend. The workers at the facilities, which account for more than 5% of global LNG supply, are backed by the Offshore Alliance (OA) - that combines the Maritime Union of Australia and Australian Workers' Union. Chevron had been negotiating with the workers for weeks alongside Australia's Woodside Energy, which managed to avert the strikes last month after reaching a deal. Here is a sequence of events leading up to the strike action: Date Development Aug. 9 Workers at Woodside's liquefied LNG facilities in Australia vote for industrial action. Aug. 10 Chevron and Woodside say they are holding talks with union to avert any potential action by the workers. Aug. 11 Australia's labor regulator, the Fair Work Commission, allows workers' union to hold a ballot of employees to decide if they wanted to make a decision on taking industrial action at Chevron's Gorgon and downstream Wheatstone LNG facilities. Aug. 15 Negotiations between Chevron, Woodside Energy Group and Australian unions continue but a source with knowledge of the matter tells Reuters that the talks are unlikely to yield results for days. Aug. 16 Woodside says ""positive progress"" was being made on talks with a union alliance on disputes over the wages of workers. Aug. 16 The Offshore Alliance says during the negotiations Woodside was ""well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration."" Aug. 18 Voting opens in Chevron's facilities to let workers decide if they want to strike due to disputes over wages and working conditions. Aug. 20 Unions at Woodside's North West Shelf offshore gas platforms announce plans to strike as early as Sept. 2. Aug. 22 Woodside CEO Meg O'Neil says the company has had ""constructively addressed"" several concerns of workers but said it also has a duty to shareholders to be able to run the business. Aug. 23 Woodside and unions meet for another round of talks to avoid the strikes. Aug. 23 Chevron's Australian unit says it would increase domestic gas production capacity at its Wheatstone facility. Aug. 24 Woodside reaches an in-principle agreement with unions to avert strikes. Aug. 24 Workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities vote to allow unions to call for a strike if necessary. Aug. 25 Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia warn that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions in exports if workers' demands on wages and conditions were not met. Aug. 28 Workers at Chevron's offshore Wheatstone facility grant unions the power to call strikes on their behalf. Aug. 28 Unions representing workers at Chevron's two major Australian LNG complexes say that they will take industrial action from Sept. 7. Aug. 29 Chevron's workers release details of industrial action including potential work stoppages of up to 10 hours. Sept. 1 Chevron workers reject a company pay and conditions offer. Sept. 1 The offshore alliance says no meetings have been scheduled between unions and Chevron. Sept. 4 Mediation talks to avert strikes at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia begin once again. Sept. 5 Chevron workers announce plans for total strikes from Sept. 14 if their demands were not met. Sept. 5 Some employees of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG facility in Australia offer to work during industrial action in a bid to avert domestic supply disruptions, the Offshore alliance says. Sept. 6 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities agree to pause planned strike action for one day until Sept. 8. Sept. 7 Chevron's LNG workers agree to delay the strike until 1 p.m. local time in Perth (0500 GMT) on Sept. 8 from the earlier scheduled start at 6 a.m. in Perth. Sept. 8 Workers at Chevron's LNG project begin strike as talks between the company and the unions fail to yield any results. Sept. 9 Chevron starts withdrawing contractor workers from Gorgon as the strike continues. Sept. 11 Chevron says it sees ""no reasonable prospect of agreement"" with the workers and would apply to the Fair Work Commission for an ""intractable bargaining"" declaration, which, if granted, would end the strike and allow the labor regulator to dictate an agreement. Sept. 12 The office of the labor regulator said it would hold a hearing on Sept. 22 about the dispute, while the unions wanted it to be held at a later date in November. Sept. 14 Union group Offshore Alliance said a turbine tripped at one of Wheatstone's two LNG trains, which convert natural gas into liquid, on the same day strikes escalated. Sept. 15 Workers begin a 24-hour strike at Chevron's LNG plants. Union representative says they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October. Sept. 18 Chevron says full production had resumed on Sept. 17 at its Wheatstone LNG plant after a fault last week cut production by almost a quarter.

The firms claim that MS used deceptive practices in relation to a credit agreement investment for a luxury high-speed rail line.The firms are seeking at least $750 million in damages from Morgan Stanley. Certares and Knighthead claim that MS illicitly restructured a deal by which they invested in a loan to Miami-based Brightline Holdings.Brightline, also a defendant in the lawsuit, is a Fortress Investment Group-backed company that is currently developing a Los Angeles-Las Vegas rail line.Per the suit, in late 2022 and early 2023, Morgan Stanley convinced the private equity firms to invest around $280 million in the loan by highlighting a “make-whole” provision that would guarantee them a certain amount based on future interest if the loan were repaid early.However, Morgan Stanley misrepresented and concealed the terms of the deal that were later used to sanction a preferred-share issue by a subsidiary of Brightline.The firms claim that the issue should have triggered the deal’s prepayment make-whole provision, and hence, they are asking for an order that requires Brightline to prepay the loan and make the make-whole payments.Notably, Certares and Knighthead claimed that they invested in the loan through their jointly managed CK Opportunities Fund. The fund was launched during the pandemic to focus on distressed assets in the travel and tourism industry.The firms claim that Morgan Stanley went out of its way to hide revisions to the original credit agreement allowing the share issue.The lawsuit suggests that Morgan Stanley was motivated to deceive the private equity firms by its desire to secure future lucrative investment-banking business with Brightline and its private equity owners at Fortress. This includes handling municipal debt transactions for Brightline that could generate ample fees for Morgan Stanley.In addition to the above-mentioned claims, Certares said that it faced retaliation from Morgan Stanley for objecting to its actions. Last month, MS declined to participate in another unrelated financing deal with Certares because of the Brightline dispute.The plaintiffs said, “This kind of retaliation is unfair and unbecoming of a global financial institution.”Morgan Stanley has said that it does not believe in the claims and, hence, would defend itself vigorously.Over the past six months, shares of Morgan Stanley have gained 3.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 7.7%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Financial Misconduct by Other FirmsLast month, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS was charged with a civil penalty of $5.5 million, per the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) order. The order required GS to cease and desist from committing future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC’s record-keeping provisions.Per CFTC’s findings, GS violated the provisions of a previous order, and failed to appropriately record and retain certain audio files.In November 2019, Goldman was levied with a civil penalty of $1 million for failure to record the phone lines of its trading and sales desk in January and February 2014 for 20 calendar days. CFTC’s order required the company to cease and desist from further violations of record-keeping regulations.However, post the 2019 order, Goldman continued to have record-keeping failures, which were in violation of the cease-and-desist provisions. It failed to record and retain audio calls due to failure in its hardware and software systems.In another case, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., a joint venture brokerage, which is 60% owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. MUFG and 40% owned by Morgan Stanley, was sued by retail investors in Japan over the sale of the Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds issued by Credit Suisse.Investors claim that they were not properly informed of the risks involved in the instrument.Notably, in an effort to address customer demand for portfolio diversification, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities sold Credit Suisse’s riskiest bonds earlier this year.However, when UBS Group AG acquired Credit Suisse, bondholders lost everything because $17 billion of the securities were wiped out. Thus, on behalf of 66 plaintiffs, a lawsuit was filed in the Tokyo District Court, wherein investors demanded 5.2 billion yen ($36 million) in compensation from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

62,22d3e8a4-3cf3-3de3-82ed-a6e3f5c9de78,MS,2023-09-20,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-morgan-stanley-130006861.html,1695128406,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this investment bank have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.3%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.14 indicates a change of +22.5% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.78 billion and $58.52 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Paras Griffin/Getty Images) (Paras Griffin via Getty Images)Solomon has attracted public scrutiny after reporting the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with media reports about his leadership style, job cuts and reports of partner unrest.Mayo said Ogunlesi ""reiterated that he does not see the CEO in the same light as some of the negative press. In particular, he expressed a view that his activities mirror those of executives at other large corporations and banks.""Under Solomon the bank is also attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer lending while it waits out a tepid period of dealmaking.David Solomon, center, is CEO of Goldman Sachs. (Niall Carson/WPA Pool/Getty Images) (WPA Pool via Getty Images)The deal drought appears to be easing this month with a new string of initial public offerings where Goldman is acting as one of the lead bankers, including IPOs from chipmaker ARM and grocery e-commerce company Instacart.Mayo said Ogunlesi ""feels that the company is on course with its strategy to deliver mid-teens returns over the medium term"" and highlighted Solomon's ""success with strategy, execution, the pivot away from consumer (albeit late), and results that have been superior to peers.""Goldman’s stock has recovered in September and is flat so far this year. It has outperformed Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) while underperforming Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).

That is better than all Wall Street rivals except Morgan Stanley and Jefferies (JEF), which has rallied 95%. The KBW index has fallen 21% over the same period.Solomon, who is still chairman of Goldman's board, told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that the string of IPOs could be a “virtuous cycle” spurring a revival of dealmaking in the months ahead.Last week at a Barclays banking conference he said the bank’s trading activity is “good” this quarter but that September also presents a ""seasonal slowdown” and comparison to the year-ago quarter will be “tough.”Mayo said in his Monday note that he asked for the meeting with Ogunlesi ""given questions about strategy, execution, management, and reputation,"" and said it was the first such meeting in seven years.As lead director Ogunlesi is considered the most powerful of Goldman's independent board members. He is also CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm.Ogunlesi told Mayo that partner turnover at Goldman has been typical, the firm has identified 200 future leaders, and the pipeline of new talent ""remains strong,"" with 236,000 applicants for last summer's internship program. That led to 2,600 full-time hires in 2023.""It is still harder to get in Goldman than to get accepted to Harvard,"" Mayo said.Ogunlesi also ""acknowledged that in hindsight, the board could have done better regarding consumer lending"" and a few other issues.Mayo said there are issues at Goldman to monitor going forward, and execution will be key. His conclusion is the ""CEO is not going anywhere anytime soon, the strategy is on an effective multi-year path, a turn in capital markets activity will make much of the media attention go away, and the board is in anything but caretaker mode.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The AI tool, dubbed 'AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant', is intended to streamline administrative and research tasks for financial advisors and support staff by providing access to over 100,000 research reports and documents.The AI model was created using OpenAI's GPT-4 software. Morgan Stanley was among the early testers of OpenAI’s custom AI programs. This follows the launch of OpenAI's enterprise tier in August, which provides businesses with GPT-4 access featuring no usage caps, faster performance, and API credits. The pricing tier is adjusted according to the size and requirements of the enterprise client.Despite this innovation, concerns persist regarding the training dataset used for ChatGPT-4 due to potential issues with copyrighted material and factual inaccuracies. Notably, OpenAI's enterprise tier does not train on data submitted by companies but instead allows clients to train their own models for various tasks including customer service, research, and administration.Morgan Stanley's introduction of an AI assistant comes as other banking giants such as JPMorgan, Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs also delve into generative AI technology. JPMorgan has committed $1 billion towards AI and data analytics in 2023, with plans to develop a ChatGPT-like AI model for selecting investments for customers. Meanwhile, Citigroup has been working on generative AI models for three years.McKinsey projects that AI could contribute up to $1 trillion of additional value annually to the global banking sector. The Evident AI Index, which ranks banks based on their readiness for the forthcoming AI revolution, places JPMorgan at the top, with U.S. banks holding seven out of the top 10 positions.Following the announcement of the AI assistant, Morgan Stanley's stock price rose by 0.4% on Monday, contributing to a year-to-date increase of 3.49%. This growth comes in spite of a volatile period for the banking sector in March.

View our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Omnicom Group was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 19.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 35%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.We Could See Omnicom Group's Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time.

The second half of September through the first week of October has historically been a particularly challenging period to own stocks.If you are an investor who is looking to position yourself in more defensive stocks over this period, then continue reading.Relative StrengthI have noticed over the last week that utilities stocks are being bought up rather aggressively. Over the last five days, the utilities sector ETF has far outperformed all the others.I think it is quite clear that large institutions are positioning themselves for the coming volatility.Consolidated Water, FirstEnergy and Vistra are top ranked utility stocks that investors should consider if they are focused on reducing high risk exposure during the coming few weeks.Consolidated WaterConsolidated Water is a company that specializes in developing and operating seawater desalination plants and water distribution systems in areas of the world where naturally occurring supplies of potable water are scarce or unavailable. Founded in the Cayman Islands in 1973, CWCO uses reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater into fresh water. This fresh water is then supplied to industrial, commercial, and residential customers. Their operations primarily span across the Caribbean region and other locations.Complementing its already strong YTD performance Consolidate Water also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates have rocketed higher over the last month.Current quarter earnings estimates have been increased by 65% and are projected to climb 660% YoY to $0.38 per share. FY23 earnings estimates have been upgraded by 50.5% and are forecast to grow 170% YoY to $1.46 per share.Story continuesCWCO is currently trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.1x, which is just above the broad market average of 21.1x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.4x. Additionally, the stock yields a dividend of 1.2%.FirstEnergy FirstEnergy is a diversified energy company headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Primarily operating through its regulated distribution subsidiaries in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, it serves millions of customers across multiple U.S. states. FirstEnergy is involved in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and also focuses on energy management and other related services. Over the years, the company has undergone various transformations, emphasizing its commitment to cleaner energy and grid modernization.FirstEnergy is expected to grow sales and earnings at a steady pace, as is typical of utilities and illustrates why they make for good additions to investment portfolios. Additionally, FE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.EPS are forecast to grow 6.45% annually over the next 3-5 years.FirstEnergy is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 14.6x, which is above the industry average of 13.8x, and just above its 10-year median of 14x. The stock also offers a hefty dividend yield of 4.2%, further sweetening the deal.Vistra Vistra is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company based in the United States. Primarily involved in the production and sale of electricity, Vistra combines a large-scale, diversified generation fleet with a retail platform, serving residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Their generation portfolio comprises natural gas, nuclear, coal, and battery storage facilities. Over time, Vistra has also emphasized its transition towards cleaner energy sources and reducing carbon emissions.Although current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered over the last month, next quarter, FY23, and FY24 have all been revised considerably higher. These aggregate raises in earnings estimates give VST a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.VST is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 10.6x, which is below the industry average of 13.8x, and below its six-year median of 13.1x. Vistra pays a dividend yield of 2.5%, and has raised the payment by an average of 13.2% annually over the last five years.Bottom LineThis seasonally weak period in the markets may take some investors by surprise, but those who enter this period with defensive stocks, or an increased cash position will come out of this situation in an advantageous position. Furthermore, even if volatility doesn't increase significantly, utility stocks will always be a welcome addition to a stock portfolio.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income and its benefits in today's world, and go directly to read 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. The concept of passive income is becoming increasingly popular as more people are leaning towards side jobs. A survey by Zapier from May 2022 found that 36% of Gen Xers have a side job, while 59% of Gen Zers and 61% of millennials have one. Gen Zers, in particular, make around $9,537 annually from their side gigs. These side hustles can be a very good way to supplement income, though they are not typically considered passive income sources. However, some side hustles may become more passive over time as people streamline operations, delegate tasks, or automate processes. Earlier this year, CNBC did a report on Jasmine McCall, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who makes $105,000 a month in passive income from her side hustle.Passive income typically comes from investments, assets, or activities that require minimal ongoing effort once set up. Last year’s inflation increased the appeal of passive investing in stocks, particularly dividend-paying stocks. Passive equity funds, which are primarily designed for long-term capital appreciation and wealth accumulation, are about to achieve a significant milestone. Their total assets worldwide are soon going to surpass the assets of actively managed funds, a trend that has been developing for over a decade, as reported by Societe Generale. According to James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, passive investing has been growing consistently in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds or passive ETFs own about 19% of the shares of the typical publicly traded U.S. stock. This ownership has tripled since 2013.AI and Passive IncomeIn a recent survey conducted by GOBankingRates, people were asked about their thoughts on using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate passive income. The results were positive, with 45% of respondents expressing their interest in using AI for passive income, and an extra 8% mentioned they had already done so.Story continuesAI-focused companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can potentially help people earn passive income. The company with its expansive digital ecosystem, offers opportunities for passive income through advertising revenue for content creators on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) utilizes AI in various aspects of its business, including its e-commerce and cloud services. Earning passive income through the company can be achieved through various avenues, primarily by participating in its affiliate program, publishing ebooks on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), or utilizing Amazon's print-on-demand services.All these strategies mentioned above can help generate passive income, but investing in dividend-paying stocks is also a dependable way to make money passively. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some well-known companies that have raised their dividends for decades, providing a regular stream of income to investors.Earning passive income can be a good idea when it aligns with one’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and available resources. Diversifying income sources and planning for the long term can enhance financial well-being. In this article, we will discuss 25 best passive income ideas to build wealth in 2023.Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured through several credible and expert sources, including Forbes, Reddit, CNBC, Barron's, and Business Insider, renowned for their insights and expertise in the field of finance and passive income. By aggregating information from these reputable outlets, we aimed to identify common threads and consensus recommendations regarding strategies for generating passive income. Our goal was to offer a curated selection of passive income ideas that have garnered recognition and success among individuals pursuing passive income.25. Music and Photo LicensingA music license is permission granted to use copyrighted music. It's commonly used in movies, TV shows, commercials, online videos, and any visual content that wants to use a song legally. It is one of the best passive income ideas as the process involves creating high-quality content, registering copyrights, and uploading work to licensing platforms like Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK), Adobe Stock, or music libraries. Shutterstock remained popular among elite funds in Insider Monkey’s database, as 31 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of Q2 2023, up from 25 in the previous quarter.24. Rent out Your Spare RoomEarning passive income by renting out a spare room in your home can be a lucrative way to make extra money. However, it is always advised to check local laws and regulations regarding room rentals. Some areas may have specific rules, permits, or taxes related to short-term rentals. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the most well-known platforms for renting out spare rooms and entire homes to travelers.

Distribution platforms like Audible allow the publishing of these audiobooks and make them available for sale on major audiobooks retailers such as iTunes and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).22. Buy and Sell WebsitesBuying and selling websites for passive income can be a profitable online business model. It involves acquiring existing websites, improving them, and then selling them for a profit. It is also important to continuously monitor the website's performance, make necessary adjustments, and track key metrics like traffic, revenue, and profitability.21. Develop a Niche Job BoardDeveloping a niche job board refers to creating an online platform or website that specializes in listing job opportunities within a specific industry, profession, or category. Unlike general job search websites like Indeed or LinkedIn, which cover a wide range of job types and industries, a niche job board focuses on a particular niche or sector. After setting up the job board, making money by charging companies for posting job listings is a good way to earn passive income. Indeed, SimplyHired, and CareerBuilder are some of the most prominent websites that operate niche job boards.20. Sell Your NotesSelling notes typically involves creating and selling study or course materials, lecture notes, or educational content to students or learners. Well-researched, organized, and easy-to-understand notes provide real value to the target audience and are and are priced competitively. Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is one of the largest online marketplaces for educational resources. It allows teachers and educators to sell their lesson plans, worksheets, and other educational materials.19.

It involves promoting other companies' products or services and earning commissions for driving sales or leads to those businesses. Consistent, quality content and effective SEO can help maintain a steady flow of commissions, making it a potentially lucrative source of passive income over the long term. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s affiliates program is one of the largest and most popular. Users can promote a wide range of products on the Amazon platform and earn commissions on sales generated through your affiliate links.18. Create a Mobile AppCreating a mobile app can be a potential source of passive income. People should either create the app themselves if they have the skills or hire a developer. It is important to make sure that the app is user-friendly, well-designed, and functions smoothly. The monetization strategy works best when earning passive income.17. Purchase ATMsPurchasing ATMs involves a specific business model and understanding of the ATM industry but it can be a very reliable way to earn passive income. When someone uses the ATM to withdraw cash, they are charged a fee for convenience, a part of which goes to the ATM owner.16. Start an E-Commerce StoreStarting an e-commerce store is one of the most popular passive income ideas today. The pandemic of 2020 has boosted online shopping and income seekers are trying to make the most of this trend. According to a report on digital shopping, more than 265 million consumers in the US are expected to be shopping online in 2023. People can earn passive income by setting up an online retail business that operates with minimal day-to-day involvement once it's established. E-commerce platforms like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) can help build and host an online store. In the second quarter of 2023, Shopify generated nearly $1.7 billion in revenues, which showed a 31% growth from the same period last year.15. Peer-to-Peer Car RentalsPeer-to-peer car rental is a practice where individuals rent their private vehicles to others on a short-term basis, usually through an online platform or app. It is a profitable venture, especially if the vehicles are underutilized. However, it's crucial to provide excellent customer service, maintain your vehicles, and understand the terms and conditions of the platform you choose. Getaround, Inc. (NYSE:GETR) offers peer-to-peer car sharing in various cities in the US. Car owners can list their vehicles for rent, and renters can book them for short-term use. The company was a part of 15 hedge fund portfolios in our database at the end of Q2 2023.14. Invest in Vending MachinesVending machines are popular among people because of their convenience and ability to provide a wide range of products and services to consumers without the need for human intervention. According to a market report, the worldwide retail vending machine market was worth about $51.91 billion in 2021 and is projected to keep growing at an annual rate of about 10.7% from 2022 to 2030. Income seekers can earn passive income through vending machines by purchasing and strategically placing these machines in high-traffic areas. After initial setup, the machines can generate income with minimal ongoing effort. It is one of the best passive income ideas on our list as effective management and product selection are key to maximizing returns.13. Royalties from Intellectual PropertiesThis idea refers to payments or fees earned by the owner or creator of intellectual property (IP) for allowing others to use, license, or distribute their intellectual assets. Income seekers should ensure that their intellectual property is legally protected through copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other applicable forms of intellectual property rights.12. Sell Designs OnlineEarning passive income by selling designs online is a creative venture. Many online marketplaces allow users to develop unique and high-quality designs that cater to a specific niche or market. This can include graphic designs, illustrations, digital art, t-shirt designs, printables, or any other creative works. Some of the most prominent platforms include Etsy, Inc. (NYSE:ETSY) and Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK).11. Investing in BondsEarning passive income by investing in bonds can be a relatively low-risk way to generate regular income. To invest in bonds, income seekers can buy them directly from the issuer or in the secondary market through a brokerage account. The secondary market allows you to buy and sell bonds from other investors. Holding bonds until they mature ensures that investors receive the full face value of the bond, provided the issuer remains solvent. This approach minimizes interest rate risk. Investors will receive regular interest payments until maturity. They can also choose to reinvest the interest income they receive, compounding the returns over time. Alternatively, investors can use the interest payments as a source of passive income.10. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) BusinessSaaS business is a model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access and use SaaS applications through web browsers. Income seekers can earn passively after developing a valuable software product, setting up a subscription-based pricing model, and continuously attracting and retaining customers. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top SaaS companies. The company’s revenue for Q2 2023 came in at $8.6 billion, which showed an 11.4% growth from the same period last year.9. High-Yield Savings AccountsA high-yield savings account is a type of savings account offered by banks and financial institutions that typically provides a higher interest rate compared to traditional savings accounts. The account with competitive interest rates allows the power of compound interest to work for income seekers. With compounding, the interest gets added to the principal balance, allowing the savings to grow over time.8. Start a Blog or YouTube ChannelStarting a blog or YouTube channel is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. Income seekers can create content according to their own interests or expertise and monetize it through methods like display ads, affiliate marketing, and selling digital products or courses. The passive aspect comes into play once the created content gains traction by attracting viewers and readers over time.7. Create a Subscription Box ServiceThis strategy involves curating and delivering a selection of products or experiences to subscribers on a recurring basis, typically monthly. Profit seekers should select a niche or theme that resonates with their target audience and establish relationships with suppliers to create high-quality themed boxes. Effective marketing strategies are key to attracting subscribers, and once a substantial customer base comes into play, the income becomes passive as subscribers renew their subscriptions automatically.6. Automated DropshippingAutomated dropshipping is a business model in e-commerce where an online retailer (the dropshipper) sells products to customers without physically handling the inventory. Instead, the drop shipper partners with a supplier or manufacturer who handles the storage, packaging, and shipping of products directly to the customers. The primary role of income seekers revolves around marketing, customer service, and optimizing their e-commerce store. As the store gains traction, it can generate passive income through product sales and repeat customers. Click to continue reading and see 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best Materials ETFs20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202312 Stocks That Will Double In 2023Disclosure.

However, the manufacturing sector is still trying to put up a strong fight during these trying times. This has seen production making steady growth for the second consecutive month in August.The sector is poised to make a turnaround as hopes of the Fed finally ending its monetary tightening campaign are high ahead of the Fed’s September FOMC. Given this scenario, industrial stocks like Hubbell Incorporated HUBB, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. AIT, Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Graham Corporation GHM and Flowserve Corporation FLS are expected to benefit in the near term.Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization Inches UpProduction at U.S. factories increased 0.4% in August after increasing 1% in July. Manufacturing output increased 0.1% during the same period. Manufacturing output somewhat slowed in August as it was held back by a 5% decline in output for motor vehicles and parts. Otherwise, factory output rose 0.6%.Capacity utilization increased to 79.7% in August, which came in line with its long-run average from 1972 to 2022.The manufacturing sector continues to face challenges, contracting for the 10th consecutive month in August. The Institute for Supply Management's  manufacturing purchasing managers index  saw a slight increase to 47.6 in August. However, any reading below 50 signifies a contraction in the sector.Production at U.S. factories has been hindered by rising costs of raw materials and increased borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve has responded to these challenges by raising its benchmark interest rate by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.However, inflation has seen a significant decline over the past year from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, while the producer price index  rose 0.7%.Story continuesHowever, a cooling job market and inflation make investors optimistic that the Federal Reserve might consider ending its current monetary tightening policy soon, with hopes that it might leave its interest rate unaltered in its September meeting.Lower interest rates bode well for the manufacturing sector as it will help boost production at U.S. factories.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in the five stocks we have picked below.

For 2023, XYL expects adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, better than the previous expectation of 17.5-18%. Due to the essential nature of the business, demand remains robust. Strong growth in the United States, Western Europe and emerging markets is driving Xylem’s top line (up 20.3% year over year in the first half of 2023). Expansion Initiatives: Xylem believes in acquiring businesses/assets to expand its product offerings. The company acquired mission-critical water treatment solutions and services provider, Evoqua, in May 2023. Evoqua’s advanced water and wastewater treatment capabilities and exposure to key industrial markets complement Xylem’s portfolio of solutions across the water cycle. The acquisition bolstered Xylem’s position in water technologies, solutions and services, and strengthened its foothold in lucrative end markets. The transaction is expected to deliver run-rate cost synergies of $140 million (out of which $40 million is expected by 2023-end) within three years upon closing. It is also expected to strengthen the company’s balance sheet.Xylem has raised its 2023 guidance to include contributions from the Evoqua acquisition. The company now expects revenues of $7.2 billion ($1.1 billion expected from the Evoqua acquisition) in 2023, reflecting a 30% jump on a reported basis and 9-10% on an organic basis. Previously, the company anticipated total revenues to increase 8-9% on both organic and reported basis. XYL expects adjusted earnings of $3.50-$3.70 per share (45 cents expected from Evoqua acquisition) for 2023 compared with $3.15-$3.35 anticipated earlier. The company boosted its earnings guidance on strong demand and commercial and operational momentum.Rewards to Shareholders: Xylem’s commitment to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first six months of 2023, Xylem paid dividends of $139 million, up 26.4% year over year. The company also bought back shares worth $9 million in the same period. In February 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 10%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

An In-Depth Look at Its Valuation,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sealed-air-see-hidden-gem-163249797.html,1695054769,STORY,['SEE'],"[Sealed Air Corp (NYSE:SEE) experienced a daily loss of 2.39% and a 3-month loss of 14.53% as of September 18, 2023. Despite these losses, the company reported an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 2.68. Given these figures, one may question: is Sealed Air significantly undervalued? We invite you to read on as we delve into an in-depth valuation analysis of Sealed Air.Introducing Sealed Air CorpSEE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SEESealed Air Corp (NYSE:SEE) is a major player in the packaging industry, offering food packaging products like Cryovac, Darfresh, and OptiDure primarily for meats. Aside from food care, the company also provides product care solutions, including Bubble Wrap, Instapak, Jiffy mailers, and shrink film packaging systems for industrial and e-commerce applications. With a market cap of $5 billion and sales amounting to $5.50 billion, Sealed Air stands as a significant entity in its sector.At the current share price of $34.27, the stock appears to be significantly undervalued when compared to its GF Value of $55.56. This discrepancy between the market price and the estimated fair value prompts a more comprehensive exploration of Sealed Air's intrinsic value.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Look at Its ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. It serves as a benchmark for the fair trading value of the stock.When the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates overvaluation and potential poor future returns. Conversely, when it is significantly below the GF Value Line, it suggests undervaluation and potentially higher future returns. In the case of Sealed Air, the stock appears to be significantly undervalued, suggesting the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Story continuesSealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Look at Its ValuationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength: A Closer LookInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can pose a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, it's essential to review a company's financial health before deciding to purchase shares. Two key indicators of financial strength are the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Sealed Air's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.06 ranks worse than 85.75% of 372 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry, indicating its financial strength is relatively poor.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Look at Its ValuationProfitability and Growth: Key IndicatorsInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is typically less risky. Sealed Air has been profitable over the past 10 years, boasting an operating margin of 15.23%, which ranks better than 91.4% of 372 companies in the Packaging &amp; Containers industry. This strong profitability is a positive indicator for potential investors.Moreover, growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. Sealed Air's 3-year average annual revenue growth of 7.4% ranks better than 52.21% of companies in its industry, suggesting a promising growth trajectory.ROIC vs. WACC: A Profitability MeasureComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can also provide insights into its profitability. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. Sealed Air's ROIC of 10.03 is higher than its WACC of 7.92, indicating effective value creation.Sealed Air (SEE): A Hidden Gem or a Mirage? An In-Depth Look at Its ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, Sealed Air appears to be significantly undervalued. Despite its poor financial strength, the company demonstrates strong profitability and promising growth, ranking better than 74.42% of companies in its industry.

80,561ab62b-89a5-3995-b5ff-546cc3f11c74,SEE,2023-09-20,7 Sleeper Stocks Primed to Pack a Surprising Punch,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sleeper-stocks-primed-pack-203337441.html,1694637217,STORY,"['TGT', 'VBTX', 'EVER', 'SEE', 'VAC']","[While some market concepts may require extensive explanation, the directive behind sleeper stocks to buy is alarmingly simple: investors targeting publicly traded securities that don’t garner as much attention as their peers. By picking up under-appreciated ideas before the spotlight shines on them, you could score yourself a great deal.Of course, if it were so easy, everyone would do it. So for full disclosure, the main concern about sleeper stocks is that they don’t achieve the recognition they deserve. To better improve the odds in your favor, all of the stocks to buy below feature, at minimum, a consensus moderate buy rating. Also, to align with the definition of “sleeper,” I used TipRanks screener tool called “media buzz,” selecting the lowest rating. With that, below are sleeper stocks to buy that just might wake up.Wolfspeed (WOLF)WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockAn American developer and manufacturer of wide-bandgap semiconductors, Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) focuses on silicon carbide and gallium nitride materials and devices for power and radio frequency applications. These include transportation, power supplies, power investors and wireless systems. It’s one of the sleeper stocks because while it’s a relevant semiconductor play, it’s not that kind of semiconductor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, you don’t need to be an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to be viable. Interestingly, for the near term, WOLF’s options flow data – which screens for big block trades likely made by institutions – shows heavy interest in bought calls. Specifically, these contracts comprise of $72.50 and $100 calls, both expiring on Jan. 19, 2024.For full disclosure, WOLF is incredibly risky due to its rather poor financial profile. In particular, its negative margins don’t help boost confidence. That said, insiders have been buying WOLF throughout this year and no one has yet sold. Finally, analysts peg WOLF as a moderate buy with a $58 price target, implying over 31% upside potential.Story continuesCrescent Energy (CRGY)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, Crescent Energy (NYSE:CRGY) bills itself as a well-capitalized, U.S. independent energy company with a portfolio of low-decline assets in proven regions across the lower 48 states. Filtering out the word salad about doing the right thing, I could find little substantive information. Turning to its security filings, I discovered that it has certain interests in oil and gas properties.I’m sorry but was it really that hard to say? Anyways, CRGY lost more than 20% of equity value in the trailing year, making it one of the sleeper stocks. However, it’s been flying higher since the end of May, making it an intriguing source of speculation.To be honest, its financials feature a mish-mash of various attributes, some good, some bad. However, I’m sure investors will appreciate the insider buying. Since November of last year, all insider transactions have been acquisitions. Lastly, analysts peg CRGY as a moderate buy with a $16.75 price target, implying over 34% upside.Sealed Air (SEE)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) is a packaging company known for its Cryovac and Bubble Wrap brands. The former is a food packaging solution and the latter is a cushioned packaging product. By the looks of it, SEE ranks among the sleeper stocks because it’s a company that slips into the background.Also, if we’re being brutally honest, SEE doesn’t immediately make a case for stocks to buy. Since the start of the year, shares fell almost 33%. Still, it’s interesting to note that Sealed Air still attracts bullish interest. For example, options flow data shows possible institutional investor activity picking up $40 calls last month that expire on Sept. 15. More encouragingly, insiders also believe in their own business.Since August of last year, insiders have been buying SEE stock and no one has been selling. For further confirmation, analysts peg SEE a moderate buy with a $45.60 price target, implying over 34% upside potential.Veritex (VBTX)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comHailing from Dallas, Texas, Veritex (NASDAQ:VBTX) is a community bank. Just from that description, you can probably guess why it’s one of the sleeper stocks. With the regional banking crisis earlier this year – and lingering questions from the fallout – the entire sector suffered a reputational blow. Unfortunately, Veritex enjoyed no exemption.Since the beginning of this year, VBTX gave up nearly 37% of its equity value. In the trailing five years, it’s gone nowhere, losing just over 40%. Still, if you’re looking for extremely speculative stocks to buy, no one’s paying attention to Veritex. And thus, you can pick up a bank that trades at only a book multiple of 0.65X, below 70.6% of its peers.Even better, insiders are buying their own stock. Since July of last year, those closest to the business have been steadily accumulating VBTX. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg shares a moderate buy. Their average price target hits $24.50, implying almost 37% upside potential.EverQuote (EVER)EverQuote (EVER) logo on webpage under a magnifying glassSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.comBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, EverQuote (NASDAQ:EVER) is an online insurance lead generation service. For those that only eat salad and not read it, insurance lead generation is the process of identifying and cultivating potential customers for an insurance business through marketing efforts. So, from that definition, you can see why EverQuote represents one of the sleeper stocks.Also, I’m afraid it’s not an immediately obvious idea for stocks to buy. Since the January opener, EVER dropped more than 56% of equity value. However, the trailing one-year loss looks a bit better, though, at “only” 24%. Aside from some positive in its balance sheet – particularly its equity-to-asset ratio – EverQuote’s financials are unremarkable.Nevertheless, one factor that could play favorably for EVER is options trader speculation. Based on its implied volatility (IV) curve, it appears traders anticipate activity at rising strike prices based on the sharp bump up in IV.Moreover, analysts peg EVER a moderate buy with an $8.50 price target, implying over 37% upside potential.OppFi (OPFI)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comEssentially a financial technology (fintech) firm with a heart of gold, OppFi (NYSE:OPFI) aims to facilitate safe, simple and more affordable credit access to 60 million Americans who presently lack traditional credit options. Per its website, OppFi notes that 64% of U.S. consumers live paycheck to paycheck. And with rising economic pressures, demand for OPFI could soar.I’ve been talking about OPFI recently and I’m glad I did. Since the start of the year, shares gained nearly 34% of equity value. Just in the past five days, OPFI returned over 4% for stakeholders. Yes, it’s one of the sleeper stocks in the grand scheme of things. However, it might not stay that way for long.In fairness, OppFi doesn’t offer the most sterling financials. Indeed, some segments (like long-term revenue growth) are poor. However, insiders have been largely buying their own stock this year. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OPFI as a moderate buy with a $4 price target, implying over 48% growth.Marriott Vacations (VAC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn intriguing but also risky idea for sleeper stocks to buy, Marriott Vacations (NYSE:VAC) is a pure-play public timeshare company. Fundamentally, Marriott Vacations may be subject to economic risks. Basically, if circumstances worsen, fewer incentives exist to spend discretionary dollars. At the same time, it’s not as if the company is targeting the most vulnerable segments of society.Indeed, the phenomenon of revenge travel has been surprisingly robust. And while VAC’s IV curve in the options market is all over the map, traders seem to anticipate the possibility of upside at the far out-the-money (OTM) strike price range. Still, it’s a bold bet given that shares in the open market stumbled more than 23% since the January opener.However, an enticing element is that it appears the insiders are the ones gambling on VAC. Despite a wave of insider selling, the most recent two insider transactions are buys. Finally, analysts peg VAC as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target stands at $152.50, implying over 49% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

WWW have lost 40.6% in the past three months due to several headwinds for a while now. Macroeconomic issues, including inflationary pressures, along with higher costs and other headwinds have been weighing on the company’s performance. On its last reported quarter's earnings call, management highlighted that the trading background is challenging, mainly in the global wholesale channels, and thus, it has lowered its revenue and earnings view for the back half of 2023. Meanwhile, the industry have fallen 12.4% in the same time frame.Wolverine reported soft results for second-quarter 2023, wherein sales and earnings fell year over year. The company posted second-quarter adjusted earnings of 19 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 20 cents per share. At constant currency, adjusted earnings per share came in at 21 cents. Although revenues came ahead of the consensus estimate, the metric fell 17.4% year over year, driven by lower revenues at most of the segments and brands.Further, the company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) unit remains sluggish. DTC revenues were down 20.3% year over year and International revenues decreased 6.2% in constant currency. Coming to segments, Active Group’s revenues dipped 10.5% year over year, while the metric at Work Group tumbled 15.6% to $117.8 million. Revenues at Lifestyle Group and Other fell 38.2% and 47%, respectively.For 2023, revenues from the ongoing business are now projected to be in the range of $2.26 billion to $2.28 billion, showing a decline of about 10-10.7% year over year. Earnings per share are now envisioned to be between 43 cents and 53 cents and adjusted earnings per share are projected to be in the bracket of 45-55 cents. The company earned $1.41 per share in 2022. For the third quarter of 2023, management projects revenues to be nearly $515 million, which reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 21%.Story continuesWhat Else?Recently, Wolverine stated additional steps for the ongoing transformation of its brand portfolio. This comprises the sale of the Hush Puppies intellectual property in China, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the sale of the Wolverine Leathers business in the United States. These actions are expected to reshape the company’s portfolio and streamline the organization, thus allowing it to grab meaningful opportunities. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company has inked a deal to sell the Hush Puppies trademarks, patents, copyrights and domains in China, Hong Kong and Macau to the present sublicensee, Beijing Jiaman Dress Co., Ltd., for roughly $58.8 million. Per the transaction, these parties have entered into a License and Cooperation agreement for mutual engagement and brand stewardship of the Hush Puppies brand across the region. This will allow the company to own and operate the Hush Puppies brand in the rest of the world. We note that Wolverine has concluded the sale of the U.S. Wolverine Leathers business to its long-time customer, New Balance, for $6 million. The aforesaid moves follow the recently completed sale of Keds to Designer Brands, Inc., as well as the strategic alternatives process for its Sperry brand.All the aforesaid moves are expected to reshape Wolverine’s portfolio and drive growth in the future.

82,35ffbd17-f6b6-3416-9947-07b6c6907561,RL,2023-09-20,Here's Why G-III Apparel (GIII) Is Rallying Ahead of Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-g-iii-apparel-142200561.html,1695133320,STORY,"['RL', 'RCL']","[Shares of G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII have surged a whopping 83% year to date, thanks to its robust business strategies with digital expansion and brand strength. The company has been undertaking several strategies, including acquisitions and licensing of well-known brands, to expand its product portfolio.Management remains optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio of key brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston. Meanwhile, the industry fell 3.6% in this year so far.A VGM Score of A further speaks volumes for this current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.  Analysts seem optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.30 billion and $3.18, respectively. These estimates show corresponding increases of 7.9% and 11.6% year over year. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 sales and EPS currently stand at $3.36 billion and $3.34, respectively, reflecting corresponding increases of 2% and 5.2% year over year.Let’s Delve DeeperG-III Apparel’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding its global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe note that the company has numerous growth opportunities including the repositioning and expansion of the Donna Karan label and a long-term license for the Nautica brand. Nautica is available in nearly 1300 freestanding stores and shops globally as well as boasts a sturdy digital presence in more than 30 countries. G-III Apparel will produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products. The company will launch in more than 200 partner doors and build 150 branded shop-in-shops. The jeans will launch in more than 200 partner doors and build 60 branded shop-in-shops.The company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. First deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall. Management has announced a new multi-year license agreement with HanesBrands to manufacture an outerwear collection for the Champion brand. The company will create quality heritage pieces to expand Champions' lifestyle offering. The product will be distributed via its diverse channels across North America and Champions' global network with first deliveries for fall of 2024.With respect to the company’s brand progress, the key brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston are likely to perform well. Expanding the company’s owned brands, including DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin, is a priority as these brands represent an important long-term profit. Also, these brands enable the company to further widen its global reach. In fiscal 2024, with the ownership of the whole Karl Lagerfeld brand, the company’s international sales will be up 20% versus the prior year. Management believes this business can expand to more than $3 billion in annual revenues over time.Story continuesWhat’s More?G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Gross profit jumped 20.9% year over year while the gross margin increased 410 basis points (bps). The wholesale segment’s gross margin was 40.6%, up 440 bps year over year.The company’s results were driven by strength in outerwear and dressier categories including sportswear, dresses and suit separates across its brands DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi's. Strength across denim, footwear and team sports also drove the results. Looking into the third quarter, the company’s order book seems good and inventory is aligned properly. The company is well positioned for the fall and holiday season.For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales to be about $3.30 billion and net income to be $145-$150 million, or between $3.05 per share and $3.15 per share. This compares favorably to net sales of $3.23 billion and a net loss of $(133.1) million, or $(2.79) per share, for fiscal 2023. It expects continued gross margin improvement for the rest of the fiscal year, and projects ending the year with the gross margin being up nearly 450 bps year over year. The second half of fiscal 2024 gross margin will benefit from moderated freight costs.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.Eye These Solid Picks TooSome other top-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank of 1, at present.

It could be part of a personal financial strategy or a pre-scheduled trading plan.On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Moody's Corporation were trading at $343.99. This gives the stock a price-earnings ratio of 43.82, which is higher than both the industry median of 18.41 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio.

91,35029b4d-f87b-39fd-9737-9d0954a4cf83,PCG,2023-09-20,US natgas prices up 2% to two-week high on daily output drop,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-natgas-prices-2-two-130803017.html,1695128883,STORY,"['PCG', 'BKR', 'NG=F']","[Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures climbed about 2% to a two-week high on Tuesday with a drop in daily output and as the amount of gas flowing to the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants increases after Freeport LNG's facility in Texas returned to near full service over the past few days. That price increase came despite forecasts for milder weather and lower gas demand over the next two weeks than previously expected. Front-month gas futures for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 6.4 cents, or 2.4%, to $2.792 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:48 a.m. EDT (1248 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since Aug. 30. Looking ahead, the premium on March 2024 futures over April 2024 , which the industry calls the widow maker, slid to around 24 cents per mmBtu, its lowest since March 2020. The industry calls the March-April spread the ""widow maker"" because rapid price moves resulting from changing weather forecasts have forced some speculators out of business, including the Amaranth hedge fund, which lost more than $6 billion in 2006. The industry uses the March-April spread to bet on winter weather forecasts since March is the last month of the winter heating season when utilities pull gas out of storage. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states eased to 102.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in September, down from a record 102.3 bcfd in August. On a daily basis, however, output was on track to drop by 3.1 bcfd to a preliminary five-month low of 99.6 bcfd on Tuesday. That would be the biggest one-day drop since December 2022. Analysts, however, said preliminary data is often revised later in the day. Meteorologists forecast the weather in the lower 48 states would remain near normal until around Sept. 24 before turning mostly warmer than usual from Sept. 25-Oct. 3. Traders, however, noted that above normal temperatures in late September were still mild with averages expected to be around 73 degrees Fahrenheit (22.8 Celsius) versus a normal of 70 F for that time of year. LSEG forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, will edge up to 95.8 bcfd next week from 95.3 bcfd this week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants averaged 12.8 bcfd so far in September, up from 12.3 bcfd in August. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. The 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 bcfd of gas for a fourth day in a row on Tuesday, up from an average of 0.3 bcfd from Sept. 10-13, according to LSEG data. Looking ahead, traders noted Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 0.8-bcfd Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland was on track to shut for about a week of planned maintenance around Sept. 21-29, according to company notices to customers. Cove Point shuts every year in the autumn for maintenance. In 2022, it shut from around Oct. 1-27, according to LSEG data. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. Much higher global prices have fed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine. Gas was trading around $11 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and $14 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia.

92,12663987-6910-355b-87f8-099cfd31cd5a,PCG,2023-09-20,10 Best Investments During A Recession,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-investments-during-recession-082559142.html,1695111959,STORY,"['UNH', 'ORLY', 'NEE', 'WMT', 'JNJ', 'PCG', 'STZ', 'PM']","[insIn this article, we discuss 10 best investments during a recession. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9.

93,1be18bd0-5916-318a-9688-d7b31515a1eb,PCG,2023-09-20,UPDATE 1-US natgas prices climb 3% on higher feedgas to Freeport LNG in Texas,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-prices-climb-193331577.html,1695065611,STORY,"['PCG', 'BKR', 'NG=F']","[(Adds latest prices) Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures climbed about 3% on Monday as the amount of gas flowing to the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants increases after Freeport LNG's facility in Texas returned to near full service over the past few days. That price increase came despite forecasts for milder weather and lower gas demand over the next two weeks than previously expected. Front-month gas futures for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 8.4 cents, or 3.2%, to settle at $2.728 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). With U.S. gas prices up about 1% last week, speculators boosted their net long futures and options position on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges for a second week in a row to their highest since late August, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report. Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states eased to 102.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in September, down from a record 102.3 bcfd in August. Meteorologists forecast the weather in the lower 48 states would remain near normal until around Sept. 24 before turning mostly warmer than usual from Sept. 25-Oct. 3. Traders, however, said that above normal temperatures in late September were still mild with averages expected to be around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22.2 Celsius) versus a normal of 70 F for that time of year. With exports expected to increase in coming weeks, LSEG forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, will edge up to 96.3 bcfd next week from 96.0 bcfd this week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Friday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants averaged 12.8 bcfd so far in September, up from 12.3 bcfd in August. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. On a daily basis, LNG feedgas hit a 16-week high of 13.5 bcfd on Sunday with the increase at Freeport. The 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 bcfd of gas for a third day in a row on Monday, up from an average of 0.3 bcfd from Sept. 10-13, according to LSEG data. Looking ahead, traders noted Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 0.8-bcfd Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland was on track to shut for about a week of planned maintenance around Sept. 21-29, according to company notices to customers. Cove Point shuts every year in the autumn for maintenance. In 2022, it shut from around Oct. 1-27, according to LSEG data. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. Much higher global prices have fed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine. Gas was trading around $11 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and $14 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia.

95,273ddb14-0762-328d-b40b-9a82b9b8a5e6,ALGN,2023-09-20,10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-3d-printing-additive-151019388.html,1695136219,STORY,"['GE', 'ADSK', 'ALGN', 'TRMB', 'AAM-PB', 'APO', 'APO-PA', 'ANSS', 'LECO', 'XRAY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks to buy. If you want to skip our introduction to why 3D manufacturing is one of the most important industries today, then check out 5 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.3D printing is one of the most disruptive technologies in the world today. It has allowed companies and enthusiasts to virtually create any product that they like out of thin air, whilst doing so otherwise would require large machines and hefty investments in fabrication equipment. This enables companies to rapidly build out parts and verify their engineering and design even if the fabrication is done only for testing purposes and mass production will take place through traditional machines.3D printers and additive manufacturing as an industry have moved forward quite rapidly over the course of the past decade or so. They are now used to manufacture some of the most complex engineering products in the world, which can withstand significant forces. Industrial equipment and products manufacturer General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)'s Italian division Avio Aero manufactures jet engine turbine blades with 3D printing, and these end up spinning thousands of times in minute at  unimaginable forces inside a jet engine.For the ancient observer, the process of manufacturing a 3D printed jet engine blade would be nothing short of magic. It involves an electron beam welding together thin layers of metal to create a product that is insusceptible to hairline or microscopic cracks. Additionally, since the machines are capable of building robust components, they can also make other components such as sensor housings. Talking numbers, by using 3D printing to manufacture ""tons"" of components for the 787 aircraft, a Boeing supplier believes that the company can save as much as $3 million in costs over the long term.While $3 million in cost savings for a jet that costs hundreds of million of dollars might seem trivial, the fact that there are other methods to fabricate complex products which are fundamentally different from existing processes shows that there is significant room for innovation on the product front and for markets at the supply end. This potential seems to be on the mind of companies as well, since a study from Ernst &amp; Young (EY) shows that out of 900 businesses surveyed in 2016 and 2019 each, the percentage that are applying additive manufacturing technology in their business operations process grew by more than 2.5x while those that did not intend to apply dropped by 3.7x. These are strong numbers for a small time period and the data also reveals that the highest percentage of business that do use 3D manufacturing are in China and South Korea.Story continuesAnother key benefit of 3D printing is the ability to produce simple products cheaply. A variety of goods, such as skateboards, goggles, and even football helmets are made by additive manufacturing. A key advantage of this is that the supply chains for these products can be easily set up domestically in the U.S. and create more jobs since traditionally such goods are imported from Asian countries where the cost of labor and other mass production inputs are lower.However, even though the potential of 3D printing is immense, the fact still remains that printers are not widely used for mass production. Mass production is the backbone of consumerism and capitalism as it allows firms to churn out billions of products each year with ease and improve the standard of living of consumers. One firm that mass produces products with 3D printing is Sonova. It makes hearing aids through additive manufacturing, and the firm claims that the technology has allowed it to produce hundreds of thousands of customized hearing pieces in a year.Finally, any discussion about 3D printing would be incomplete without SpaceX particularly as aerospace is one of the hottest topics in the media these days. SpaceX was one of the first companies to 3D print a rocket engine, as the firm revealed a thruster for its Dragon spacecraft built through additive manufacturing back in 2013. Another rocket company that is quite agile when it comes to blending the latest manufacturing technology in its production process is Relativity Space. The firm is aiming to compete with SpaceX in the crucial area of rocket reusability and it is designing the Terran R medium lift vehicle (equivalent to SpaceX's Falcon 9). This rocket aims to be fully reusable and manufactured by 3D printing.As to what's happening in the printer industry right now, here's what the executives of Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM) had to say during the firm's latest earnings conference call:Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $53.3 million, a very strong 29% growth over the first quarter of 2023. As you’ll recall, we entered the year with a questionable outlook on the demand side as macro pressures with in our industry. And we certainly felt that in the first quarter.There was a continuation of that softness into the start of the second quarter. However, quarter momentum really began to pick up, and we finished the quarter with strength. While there’s still some element of caution in the environment, we’re very encouraged by the recent customer activity that led to our second quarter results. This momentum gives us confidence in the early signs of a recovery and also validates feedback we’ve been receiving from customers that we would see an uptick in orders as we progress through 2023. In combination with this improved customer demand profile in a variety of near-term growth opportunities, we feel very good about the second half of 2023, and we’re reaffirming our 2023 revenue guidance. Meanwhile, the DM team has been laser-focused on something we have full control of, reducing our cost structure.Today we'll look at some top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks and the top picks in this piece are Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK).10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To BuyRuslans Golenkovs/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks, we used our previous coverage and Ark Invest's 3D Printing ETF and ranked the top 30 companies that are traded on U.S. exchanges through the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q2 2023.

To see more such funds, go directly to 5 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for Retirees.As millions of Americans approach retirement age, retirement planning is taking on ever greater significance. Every year, a substantial number of Baby Boomers retire, and concurrently, millennials are becoming more engaged in considering their own retirement. After all, the main income source for the majority of individuals is their job. Unless they possess substantial inheritance, it's essential to commence retirement planning right from the outset of their professional journey. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)'s Modern Wealth Survey, Americans now consider a minimum of $2.2 million as the threshold for wealth, surpassing the previous benchmark of $1 million. This same trend extends to retirement, where the target for a comfortable retirement has shifted from $1 million to $1.25 million over the years.Throughout 2021, the economy grappled with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to bounce back, various notable challenges cast uncertainty over the recovery. Inflation surged to levels not witnessed for many years, supply-chain disruptions tempered economic expansion, and a constrained labor market posed ongoing challenges for employers, exacerbated by a record number of employees either transitioning to new roles or exiting the workforce altogether. Another result of the COVID-19 pandemic's emergence was the increasing popularity of retirement among Americans. According to a New York Times report, many millennial workers aspire to retire in their 50s to pursue their personal interests. However, their financial circumstances appear to tell a different story. The report cited findings from Willis Towers Watson's Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, indicating that 36% of millennial workers in a broad range of industries were saving a mere 5% of their income, a sum insufficient to cover their living expenses during retirement. However, 52% of the respondents said they expected to retire before 65. The 2022 TIAA Retirement Insights Survey echoed these sentiments, reporting that 31 percent of individuals aged 30 to 39 expressed above-average confidence in their retirement planning capabilities. Among the younger millennial cohort, aged 25 to 29, confidence was even higher, with 40 percent believing they had an above-average level of competence in retirement planning.Story continuesHowever, despite this confidence, several Americans are falling short in their savings efforts, and a significant portion is failing to contribute enough to their 401(k) plans to receive the full employer match. According to a recent survey conducted by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, 64% of working individuals surveyed expressed confidence in their financial outlook for retirement. This represents a decrease from the 73% reported the previous year. Notably, only 18% of those surveyed expressed being ""very confident"" this year, down from the 30% reported in the previous year.Vanguard's How American Saves 2022 report provides insight on how Americans are building their retirement savings. In recent years, automatic savings features have seen a significant surge in popularity. By the close of 2021, 56% of Vanguard plans had embraced automatic enrollment, a trend especially notable in plans with over 1,000 participants, where 75% had adopted this approach. Additionally, Americans are increasingly favoring professionally managed accounts and services as they plan for retirement. By the end of 2021, an impressive 64% of all Vanguard participants had placed their investments solely in automatic investment programs, marking a substantial increase from the 7% reported at the end of 2004. Vanguard presents a range of target-date retirement funds, some of which are featured in our list. These funds have been steadily gaining traction. According to a Vanguard report, 56% of their participants had invested in a single target-date fund. Reflecting their growing appeal, the availability of target-date funds in plans increased to 95% by the end of 2021, compared to 84% in 2012.In spite of the aforementioned data, the United States boasts a thriving and robust retirement industry. According to McKinsey, the U.S. retirement market possesses an impressive $26 trillion in assets. This data unveils a remarkable forecast: by 2030, retirees are anticipated to make a greater contribution to global consumption than individuals in the working age range of 15 to 59 years in China. The research conducted by McKinsey reveals that Defined Contribution, the largest segment within the retirement industry, constitutes approximately 30% of the total assets, totaling around $8 trillion. These assets generate an impressive $30 billion in revenue for the managing firms, overseeing approximately 110 million accounts. Notably, the Defined Contribution industry has displayed consistent growth over the last decade.Lastly, a significant aspect of retirement pertains to the assisted living community sector, also referred to as old age homes. These establishments provide seniors with companionship and care during the latter phases of their lives. As outlined in a research report by Grand View Market Research, the assisted living industry was valued at approximately $91.8 billion in 2022, and is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. Within the market, the segment catering to individuals aged 85 and above claimed the largest market share in 2022. Looking ahead to 2040, the number of seniors in this age group is projected to more than double, increasing from 6.4 million in 2016 to an estimated 14.6 million.11 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for RetireesPhoto by Diana Parkhouse on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we thoroughly examined Vanguard's selection of retirement-oriented funds and curated a list of 11 funds that are highly regarded for their safety and popularity among retirement experts and market analysts. The goal of this compilation is to offer a comprehensive selection of well-regarded funds listed on US exchanges. Furthermore, we have highlighted the top holdings of these ETFs, wherever applicable, which include prominent companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), to provide deeper insights for potential investors. Lastly, these Vanguard ETFs have demonstrated remarkable growth over the past five years. The list is organized in ascending order based on their five-year performance as of September 14, 2023.11. Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 6.39%Positioned perfectly between income and growth, the Vanguard Growth and Income Fund (MUTF:VQNPX) aims to surpass the S&amp;Ps 500 Index, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both dividend income and potential stock price appreciation. Investors will gain exposure to leading stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B).10. Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 12.55%Target-date funds like Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (MUTF:VSVNX) have been tailored with long-term investors in mind as they prepare for retirement. VSVNX, designed for young investors eyeing retirement around 2070, boasts a modest 0.08% expense ratio, translating to an annual fee of $8 on a $10,000 investment. This fund's primary objective is to achieve capital growth and current income in line with its current target allocation. It accomplishes this by gradually shifting its investments into a more conservative blend of Vanguard funds, including the Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Stock Index Fund, Total International Bond II Index Fund, and Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Fund.9. Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 13.50%The Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund (MUTF:VASGX) is an excellent choice for younger investors who are comfortable with greater risk. This LifeStrategy fund is geared toward achieving long-term capital growth and maintains a fixed asset allocation, with roughly 80% invested in global stocks and 20% in global bonds. It's worth noting that VASGX does carry a slightly higher expense ratio of 0.14% in comparison to target-date funds and has a minimum investment requirement of $3,000.8. Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (NASDAQ:VTTSX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 21.02%Instead of fixating on a specific retirement year, Vanguard adopts a five-year timeframe – for instance, 2056 to 2060 in the instance of VTTSX. This approach renders the fund well-suited for a more adaptable retirement planning approach. As the target retirement date for each fund draws nearer, VTTSX offers investors diversification along with a gradual reduction in stock exposure and a corresponding increase in bond exposure.7. Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 27.34%The Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VT) stands out as a top Vanguard retirement fund due to its comprehensive coverage of both developed and emerging markets.

Noteworthy among the ETF's holdings are significant companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).6. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX)5-Year Performance as of September 14: 29.75%Opting for Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (MUTF:VIMAX) is a strong choice for bolstering the mid-cap stock segment of your investment portfolio, especially if you're aiming to expand your holdings across a broader spectrum of equities. According to an S&amp;P Global report, mid-cap stocks consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 for most of the 20-year period concluding on August 31, 2015.

GOOGL, to augment the development of software solutions with advanced AI-ML capabilities. The AVA Data suite is a comprehensive collection of readily available and proven data products. Its integration with Google Cloud enriches communication service providers (CSPs) with a standard library of high-quality reusable networks and IT data packages across 4G, 5G domains. By fully harnessing the potential of AI, it brings CSPs closer to achieving zero-touch automation, optimizing the development and management of their network services.The AVA Data suite capitalizes on Nokia’s AVA Open Analytics that offers streamlined ML operations, a data mesh approach, cloud-driven architecture and zero trust security policies. Unlike the traditional approach of legacy big data systems, which incorporate raw data from multiple data sources into a large data warehouse or data lake, data mesh chooses a different route.It virtually combines data from dispersed sources per specific business domains such as sales, marketing, customer service and more. This implies a shift from a centralized data platform to a multiple decentralized data storage system. It accelerates information extraction from multi-vendor multi-domain data hubs and significantly improves agility in business processes.Google’s Vertex AI provides the vital infrastructure for designing and training AI/ML models.

We decided to start a new campaign in Microsoft this quarter based on our view that it is the cleanest and clearest way to invest in the rise of generative AI. The company is building AI-driven copilots (AI-driven productivity tools) into all parts of the ecosystem, and it has become increasingly clear to us that this is the way the world is moving. These efforts started with Microsoft-owned GitHub Copilot to help software developers write code more efficiently. However, Microsoft has announced new Copilot features across other applications, such as Windows, which could significantly improve productivity for its massive user base. Given the pace of innovation around introducing these features across its products (e.g., GitHub, Office 365, Dynamics 365), we believe knowledge workers will capture productivity gains and the company will capture higher revenues per user. Furthermore, the rise of AI will also lead to more Azure usage and strengthen its lead over public cloud competitors.

106,5de72bb7-11d2-3efb-be01-6a55554f8957,MSFT,2023-09-20,"Billionaire Ken Griffin Is Getting Anxious About the Stock Market, but Betting Big on These 2 Tech Titans",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-griffin-getting-anxious-091414569.html,1695201254,STORY,"['MSFT', 'AMZN']","[Generative AI burst onto the scene last November, and fueled a boom in tech stocks – a boom that effectively ended last year’s bear and sparked off this year’s market rally.But some headwinds are starting to pile up, and some market bigwigs are predicting a crash on the horizon. Ken Griffin, the billionaire investor and founder of Citadel, is downbeat on the near term, saying, “I’d like to believe that this rally has legs, [but] I’m a bit anxious we’re in the seventh or eighth inning of this rally.”Specifically, Griffin, who has a net worth of ~$35.4 billion, points to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. For the past year and a half, the central bank has been raising rates, and he believes that the increasing effect of the rate hikes is going to outweigh the AI boom. “We’re now at the point where we’re going to see the impact of these hikes really start to play out,” he says. “We’re seeing the job market starting to weaken.”This hasn’t caused Griffin to back away from the stock markets. Rather, he has doubled down – and more – on two of the market’s ‘tech titans,’ giants of the industry with the deep resources necessary to survive and thrive even in a recessionary environment. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pull up the details on two of the tech giants that Griffin has bet big on recently; here they are, along with comments from the Street’s analysts.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)The first stock on our list today is Microsoft, one of the best-known names in personal computing and software. The company has its hands in virtually every aspect of the home and business computer industry, and its $13 billion investment in OpenAI paid off last year, when that firm released ChatGPT and sparked off the market’s current rally.Microsoft’s long history of both innovation and success has pushed it into the uppermost tier of publicly traded companies. Microsoft currently boasts a market cap of $2.44 trillion, and realized nearly $212 billion in total revenues in its fiscal year 2023. The company has not been resting on its laurels, however. It is using ChatGPT as the AI behind the Bing search engine, and by adding natural language capabilities to Bing is making an effort to challenge Google for market share in the search arena. Microsoft is also using AI in additional products, including its Edge web browser and its Office products, and the company’s Azure business cloud infrastructure platform is incorporating the new technology.Story continuesAt the bottom line, any investment is about returns, and in its most recent quarterly report – Q4 of fiscal year 2023, which ended on June 30 – Microsoft reported a top line of $56.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings of $2.69 per share. The revenue results were up more than 8% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $710 million, while the bottom line was 14 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s intelligent cloud segment accounted for $24 billion of the revenue total, up 15% y/y.For Griffin, Microsoft’s strengths are evidently clear. The billionaire stock maven added 2,041,023 shares of MSFT to his portfolio during Q2, expanding his existing holding in the stock by 150%. Griffin’s total stake in Microsoft is valued at ~$1.12 billion.Also bullish on Microsoft is Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth, who specifically points out the company’s large and growing AI exposure as a key point. The 5-star analyst writes, “MSFT is at the forefront of the AI revolution driven by its continued integration of increasing AI functionality, incorporating ChatGPT across all aspects of its business and product lines, which will drive the acceleration of the digital global transformation and highlights its investment opportunity. MSFT will lead the AI revolution driving change across every facet of enterprise IT and computing processes driven by the increasing need for operating efficiency, a technology-driven competitive edge, and increasing productivity and creativity. MSFT’s increasing position as a dominant AI service provider will continue to drive revenue growth and share price gains.”These comments support Feinseth’s Buy rating on MSFT, and his $433 price target implies a 32% gain for the shares on the one-year horizon. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here.)The tech titans never fail to attract attention from the Street, and Microsoft has 34 current analyst reviews on file, including 30 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $328.65 with an average price target of $392.41 suggesting a 19% upside potential in the next 12 months. (See Microsoft’s stock forecast.)Amazon (AMZN)Next up is another instantly recognizable name, Amazon. This global leader in e-commerce got its start in the late 1990s as an online bookseller, survived the bursting of the dot.com bubble, and has since grown to become the fourth largest firm in the public markets, with a market cap of $1.44 trillion. In 2022, Amazon’s online retail operations generated some $690 billion in gross merchandise volume.But leadership in online retail is hardly the only story here. Amazon combines practical online tech experience with enormously deep pockets, and has been developing new products to take full advantage of the emerging generative AI. These AI-powered additions to the product line include a chatbot, an image building platform, and a software code development platform. Amazon’s cloud software service, AWS, also makes extensive use of AI – and it is already generating $22 billion in annual revenue. Underneath all of this, and helping to support it, Amazon has built the brick-and-mortar physical infrastructure of its fulfillment network, with more than 541 million square feet of warehouse space.Like Microsoft above, Amazon beat the forecasts in its last quarterly report. The results for 2Q23 showed that the company hit a top line of $134.4 billion, $3 billion more than expected and nearly 11% above the prior-year results. The revenue beat was powered by AWS, which saw 12% y/y growth and hit $22.1 billion, and the huge North American retail segment, which was up 11% y/y and totaled $82.5 billion. Amazon’s bottom line earnings, reported as an EPS of 65 cents per share, were up dramatically from the 2Q22 net loss of 20 cents per share, and beat the estimates by 31 cents.As for Griffin, he made a strong move to acquire Amazon shares in the second quarter of this year, and bought 3,676,582 shares. This increased his AMZN holding by 258%; his exposure to Amazon now stands at $702.6 million.Barton Crockett, from Rosenblatt Securities, is another bull when it comes to Amazon. The analyst is impressed by the company’s growing results, and believes it can leverage AI to its long-term advantage. He says in his recent note on the stock, “Our past concerns — that consensus views were too optimistic — have abated. As the business resets, with efficiency a new focus for retail, and AI an emerging driver in cloud, the risk of impending economic headwinds looks less worrying, opening the door to higher multiple consumer growth stories… Amazon is trading at an EV near 13x 2023E, well below past norms in the 20s. Meanwhile, margin improvements are accelerating EBITDA growth.”Looking ahead, Crockett gives AMZN a Buy rating with a $184 price target pointing toward a 12-month gain of 34%. (To watch Crockett’s track record, click here.)The 40 recent analyst reviews here break down to a lopsided 39 Buys against a single Hold, backing up the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in Amazon are priced at $137.63, and their $175.63 average price target suggests a 28% increase on the one-year time frame.

108,ea04c566-b7ee-32bb-a0ec-1a728a9abeb1,MSFT,2023-09-20,10 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-large-cap-growth-062019493.html,1695190819,STORY,"['COMP', '^GSPC', '^DJI', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'ALB']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the current macro-environment, you can go directly to the 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.Few combinations in the investment world are as appealing as the stability offered by large-cap companies with strong operational efficiency combined with growth attributes such as high revenue, solid valuations, and high projected growth rates. This is where the best large-cap growth ETFs come into play as they group together corporations that have a market capitalization of generally at least $10 billion with strong growth potential. For those investors who can tolerate short-term market uncertainty, have a long-term investment horizon, and adopt a buy-and-hold approach, large-cap growth ETFs are often a more suitable choice compared to small-cap growth ETFs. These growth-focused ETFs frequently surpass the performance of the broader market, as evidenced by the fact that all the 10 best large-cap growth ETFs on our list below have outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 Index based on the five-year price performance. During this period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 Index have recorded a gain of 33.5% and 55.1%, respectively. Furthermore, nine of the 10 ETFs shortlisted have even outperformed the NASDAQ Composite Index, which experienced an increase of 73.9% during the 5-year period. Despite the high level of global uncertainty in the last five years, the best large-cap growth ETFs for the long term have also surpassed the performance of safe-haven investments like gold, which observed an increase of 62.3% in the last five years.Large-cap growth ETFs can either be concentrated on a single sector or multiple sectors. The exposure to multiple sectors offers investors the benefit of diversification across many growth stocks while maintaining cost-effectiveness compared to actively managed growth funds. However, these ETFs come with associated risks like higher volatility as growth stocks have significant price fluctuations. Furthermore, these stocks offer low or no dividend income as they are focused on reinvesting their profits to fuel growth. Some large-cap growth ETFs track popular US large-cap growth indexes like the Russell 1000 Growth Index, S&amp;P 500 Growth Index, and NASDAQ-100. These ETFs typically concentrate on sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare, resulting in a lower exposure to defensive sectors like consumer staples, energy, and utilities. However, when considering investments in these sectors, it's crucial for investors to exercise caution and select the right growth themes, especially in light of the current economic outlook. Additionally, for investors interested in exploring value-oriented investments, there are also a range of attractive options available, including 12 Best Large-Cap Value ETFs.Story continuesMarket OutlookThe American Bankers Association (ABA) anticipates real GDP growth slowing down from 2.1% during the first three quarters of 2023 to less than 1% annualized in the next three quarters. However, the momentum in economic growth is expected to improve in the second half of 2023. Furthermore, experts believe that the US Federal Reserve has completed its cycle of interest rate hikes. As of the upcoming meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on September 20, it is expected that the central bank will maintain the benchmark interest rates within the existing range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Analysts also foresee a potential reversal in this trend, with the US central bank considering lowering the interest rate in either the first or second quarter of 2024. This shift in monetary policy is being driven by signs that inflation in the United States is coming under control, clocking in at 3.7% in August 2023, compared to the peak of 9.1% witnessed in June 2022.The prospect of no further interest rate hikes and the potential for rate cuts in the future would indeed be welcomed by large-cap growth stocks. These stocks tend to perform well when borrowing costs are low as it allows them to access capital more affordably for expansion and investment. This was evident during the pandemic when the Federal Reserve lowered benchmark interest rates to near zero, contributing to the growth of large-cap growth stocks. Furthermore, the probability of a recession in the next 12 months has also plummeted from a peak of 65% in October 2022 to 30% only, which is another positive for large-cap growth stocks such as Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).Our Methodology We have shortlisted the 10 best large-cap growth ETFs based on their 5-year performance as of September 18. We have only screened for ETFs that provide nearly 100% exposure to equities and do not employ derivatives, leverage, swaps, or any other financial instruments to boost their returns. The iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWY), more commonly known as the iShares US large-cap ETF, is also amongst the notable large-cap growth ETFs shortlisted.10 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs10.

Equal weighting minimizes concentration risk compared to market cap-weighted ETFs like Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), where mega-caps can dominate. The First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund (NASDAQ:QQEW) has the highest expense ratio amongst all the ETFs on our list.9.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Collectively, these stocks represent 39.1% of the ETF’s portfolio. The ETF's top three allocated sectors are information technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services, representing 45.1%, 16.6%, and 13.3% of assets, respectively.8. iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF)5-Year Price Performance: 80.7%Total Net Assets as of September 18, 2023: $72.09 billionExpense Ratio: 0.19%Number of Holdings: 445iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF) tracks the Russell 1000 Growth index, which represents the largest 1,000 US companies characterized by higher price-to-book ratios and forecasted growth rates.As of September 2023, the ETF’s largest holdings as of September 2023 are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), indicating a significant emphasis on prominent technology companies. In terms of sector allocation, the ETF allocates 43.9% to information technology, 16% to consumer cyclical, 11.3% to communication services, and 11% to healthcare.Here's what Giverny Capital Asset Management, LLC said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“I have believed for a while that we’re better served with a lower weight to the tech giants – we own Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.1% of our model portfolio at the end of June) and Meta (5.2%) for a 13.3% exposure, or about half the Index’s weight in the giants. And while Alphabet’s 36% return for the first half and Meta’s 138% return were gratefully received, I’m pleased to report that if we strip out that contribution to our overall return, the other 23 stocks we own, constituting 85% of our portfolio (with cash making up the balance), were up 10.2% on a weighted basis.GCAM owns two of the seven tech mega caps in Alphabet and Meta, and they enjoyed similar rises. As mentioned, Alphabet A&amp;C shares rose 36% while Meta rose 138%. Together, they added 2.38 percentage points to the overall Index return, meaning these seven tech giants cumulatively generated 12.4 percentage points of return, or roughly three-quarters of the Index’s return.Alphabet and Meta combined sport a $2.25 trillion market cap and between them should generate roughly $120 billion of pretax profit this year. That’s a multiple of 19 times pretax profit, a substantial discount to Microsoft and Apple, and an even larger discount to Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla.”7.

They had surged more than 62% under Bird's leadership, but are still off their 1999 all-time high of 2,433.9 pence.Bird sought to sharpen Pearson's focus to selling directly to consumers and away from traditional educational outlets as the pandemic boosted demand for online learning.He rejected an $8.5-billion takeover approach from Apollo last year.Pearson would compensate Abbosh for leaving Microsoft, including cash and an award of restricted shares equivalent to a maximum of 50,813 Microsoft shares or about 13 million pounds ($16.06 million) at the current price and foreign exchange rates, it said.Abbosh is currently president of Microsoft's Industry Solutions business, following three decades at Accenture in numerous senior leadership roles, including chief strategy officer.""The Company is at an exciting stage of its growth journey in markets that are increasingly digital.

He also acknowledged the associated risks that accompany the rapid development of this technology.Ellison's remarks followed Oracle's surprising venture into generative AI, which has led to a fundamental shift in the company's operations. The software giant is moving towards autonomous databases that install, configure, and update themselves, thereby increasing security by eliminating human errors and shrinking teams. Ellison noted that generative AI was ""changing everything at Oracle.""The tech mogul also reflected on the impact of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which was unveiled about a year ago. The AI's ability to engage in conversation was an unexpected development that captured the imagination of developers and professionals worldwide.During his address, Ellison announced 'MultiCloud', a collaboration between Microsoft Cloud and Oracle Cloud. This partnership will see Oracle hardware and software installed in Microsoft Azure data centers and Oracle databases hosted on Exadata hardware. The collaboration aims to offer seamless service for customers using both cloud services.Ellison recalled a conversation with Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, where they agreed on the importance of open and interconnected cloud services.

112,2b8a6b0f-7c9d-3d56-be66-6204221d1661,WBA,2023-09-20,A Vitamin A Day,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vitamin-day-131500734.html,1695129300.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Walgreens and Vitamin Angels have rolled out the next phase of their pilot program, providing free prenatal vitamins to pregnant women in underserved communities across the U.S.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 19, 2023 / Walgreens Boots AllianceOriginally published by Walgreens Boots AllianceBy Sarah CasonPregnancy can be a difficult path. It comes with physical changes, emotional stressors, and oftentimes, financial burdens-especially for women who lack proper access to healthcare.For ten years, Walgreens has partnered with Vitamin Angels to donate 1% of all retail vitamin and supplement sales, providing life-changing vitamins to nearly 400 million at-risk women and children in 65 countries and all 50 U.S. states. By August 2025, the aim is to bring that number to 500 million women and children globally.In 2021, Walgreens and Vitamin Angels combined efforts to introduce a prenatal vitamin pilot program to women in the U.S., distributing prenatal vitamins and nutrition education information to expecting mothers. This summer, to build upon the pilot's initial success, the program expanded to 12 additional markets and nearly 400 additional stores across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.Accessibility was also expanded, including a direct ship option to women in select eligible zip codes. Some Walgreens pharmacies that offer the prenatal vitamins are now located within health systems such as hospitals and medical office buildings.""Our partnership started in 2013 to continue Vitamin Angels' momentum of improving maternal health in local underserved communities. Walgreens has been a fantastic partner in scaling this effort to create a long-term, sustainable program that reached even more women across the country,"" says Jessica Karas, director of development operations at Vitamin Angels.Supporting maternal health at homeToday, there are approximately 1 million underserved pregnant women in the United States with limited to no access to prenatal vitamins. Barriers to accessing these supplements can be due to a range of factors, including gaps in insurance coverage during pregnancy, lack of transportation, poverty and unemployment.Story continues""When a mother finds out she's expecting, it comes with so many changes, both physical and emotional,"" says Robyn Williams, mother of two and regional healthcare director for Walgreens Gulf Coast, an area where the pilot has expanded in recent months. ""And then some mothers are faced with financial challenges that can be incredibly stressful. It doesn't have to be like that. Healthy pregnancies are within reach. And we want to make sure their journey is as seamless as possible.""Now that the program has expanded to markets determined to be in need of more substantive maternal health support, more underserved pregnant women can pick up a free bottle of Vitamin Angels prenatal vitamins. Community partners play a key role in the pilot program by distributing free informational vouchers and spreading the word throughout their communities to pregnant women. Women can redeem vouchers in-store or online depending on their markets' eligibility, but they can also walk into a participating Walgreens store to pick up vitamins by simply asking their local pharmacist.This third phase of the pilot launched June 1, 2023. So far, the demand for prenatal vitamins has skyrocketed: There have been more than 1,900 voucher redemptions to date.Right now, Vitamin Angels reaches 250,000 American women a year, and with Walgreens' help, the plan is to double that number-to reach 500,000 women annually-by Dec. 31, 2024.Refining the process for successDuring the past two years, the program has grown and evolved to make access to essential nutrients even easier with a direct ship option in select eligible zip codes for women unable to visit a Walgreens store. This benefit is critical for women who don't have access to a car or convenient transportation.""Based on the feedback we received, lack of transportation was almost unanimous among the women we spoke to,"" explains Karas.The free prenatal vitamins are also available in some health systems with Walgreens pharmacies onsite. Now, medical professionals familiar with their patient's histories can also educate them about the benefits of participating in the prenatal program and provide them with vouchers to redeem during their appointment.""One of the most exciting developments in this phase has been the inclusion of Walgreens pharmacies within health systems,"" says Alethia Jackson, senior vice president, ESG and chief DEI officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance. ""After patients receive prenatal care, their immediate next step can be to visit the pharmacy onsite and receive vitamins. It's a full circle moment that takes one thing off the plate for expecting mothers and entrusts them with a local pharmacist for any further support they need on their pregnancy journey.""Making a lifelong impactIf anyone knows firsthand the importance of prenatal vitamins, it's Hope Tran. Not only is she a Walgreens specialty pharmacist, but she's also expecting her second child.""Nutrition plays a huge role in pregnancy, I know that firsthand. A typical diet doesn't necessarily contain all the vitamins that my baby and I need,"" Tran says. ""So I know that when I take my prenatal vitamins every day it'll supplement what I eat and boost the likelihood that the pregnancy will be a healthy one.""According to the Mayo Clinic, taking a daily prenatal vitamin greatly improves a mother's health and a baby's development, both in-utero and post-delivery, often increasing the child's birth weight and improving functions in their brain and spinal cord. The nutrients found in prenatal supplements, such as vitamin D, can reduce the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or C-section delivery.Pregnant women are supplied with six months of Vitamin Angels' prenatal vitamins, and they can request more if needed. The end goal is to ensure a health pregnancy and start at life for families in communities that haven't received this kind of support in the past.""Being a part of this partnership with Vitamin Angels gives me a great sense of pride,"" says Williams. ""Really, what can be more important than giving babies and mothers nutritional support? It starts them on a foundation for a healthy life.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/785433/a-vitamin-a-day]"

(NASDAQ:WBA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 31% losses, last week’s 3.5% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walgreens Boots Alliance. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walgreens Boots Alliance. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Newcip S.A. with 17% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 7.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots AllianceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$68m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 17%, of the Walgreens Boots Alliance stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

My Top 3 Picks to Replace Roz Brewer.,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-walgreens-ceo-top-3-201814928.html,1694636294.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Roz Brewer joined Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) as its chief executive officer (CEO) with great fanfare in January 2021.“The Board conducted an extensive search to identify an exceptional leader who will build on WBA’s track record of success and take advantage of the many growth opportunities in many markets across the company. We are excited to have found that person in Roz,” said Stefano Pessina, the business’ largest shareholder.On Sept. 1, Brewer stepped down as CEO and board member after less than two years in the job.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“Roz navigated the company through the global pandemic, overseeing the critical rollout of vaccines in Walgreens pharmacies and to high-risk populations across the country. She furthered our consumer facing capabilities while supporting the culture of community and team-member engagement in difficult times,” Pessina stated in the stunning announcement.WBA stock continues to move lower as the company searches for the next Walgreens CEO. It’s down 14% since the beginning of September and more than 41% year-to-date.There’s no question that Brewer didn’t live up to her resume. However, it just might be that Walgreens is unfixable.Who becomes the next CEO is the million-dollar question. Here are my three picks to take the reins.Laura Alber, Williams Sonoma (WSM)Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mallSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.comThere are currently 52 companies in the Fortune 500 that have women CEOs. Wait, I apologize; with Brewer’s departure, the number has dropped to 51.Therefore, my first suggestion will come from the list of quality women on Fortune’s list. They don’t necessarily have to have retail or healthcare experience, but they definitely need senior management experience.Preferably, they should also have been in their current job for several years. Let’s say at least five — since 2018. That reduces the field of candidates to 14.I don’t know if she wants a new challenge — the task would be enormous — but Williams Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) CEO Laura Alber has been one of America’s best leaders over the past 13 years, rising through the ranks at the specialty retailer, to become CEO in May 2010.Story continuesAlber just turned 55, so conceivably, she has another decade of leadership.“I thought I’d have my own company and be an entrepreneur,” Alber told Investor’s Business Daily in July 2021. ”When I came to Williams Sonoma I was thrilled to be at a company where I was able to do that and was given the responsibility to grow businesses.”Whoever Walgreens hires will have to be given complete control of the future direction of the business and the green light to do whatever needs to be done to right the ship.Alber’s used to high margins — it had an operating margin of 15.5% in the trailing 12 months — so I’m not sure she wants the hassles of a business with a five-year average operating margin of 1.4%.She’s a natural leader.Joseph Zubretsky, Molina Healthcare (MOH)The logo for Molina Healthcare displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSince Joseph Zubretsky was hired as CEO of Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) in October 2017, the provider of managed healthcare services through Medicaid and Medicare has seen its stock appreciate by 393% — more than five times better than the S&amp;P 500.Zubretsky’s background suits the job — he’s spent more than 35 years in the insurance and financial services industries, including 9 years at Aetna in various senior positions — and he’s coming up on his sixth anniversary in the top job.“Joe is the right CEO to lead Molina during this transformative period. He has a track record of strong leadership across multiple businesses, both inside and outside managed care, and has first-hand experience in leading restructuring efforts at previous organizations,” stated Molina Chairman Dale Wolf in October 2017.That last sentence, in particular, stands out.Through its VillageMD subsidiary, the company acquired primary care provider Summit Health-CityMD for $8.9 billion in early 2023. It has more than 370 clinics in the Northeast and Oregon. It was part of Walgreens’ big push into healthcare.Whoever takes the job must figure out how to balance the company’s desire for growth through primary care and its legacy pharmacy operations.“Healthcare is a lucrative sector, and Walgreens is not wrong to see it as a major part of its future playbook,” Global Data Managing Director Neil Saunders told the AP. “However, the new permanent CEO will need to remember that it is possible to invest in both healthcare and retail. It should not be an either/or decision.”Although Zubretsky is 65, I think he could get the company on the right footing before his 70th birthday.It’s an inspired choice but unlikely.Ginger Graham, Walgreens (WBA)WBA Stock Looking Healthier Now That It’s in the DowSource: ShutterstockWalgreens’ lead independent director, Ginger Graham, is the interim CEO of the company. She has nearly three decades of healthcare experience and has served on Walgreens’ board since 2010.“Ginger is the ideal person to serve as interim CEO, given her leadership experience across multiple segments of the healthcare industry, deep knowledge of WBA, and strong operational skills,” Pessina stated in the press release announcing the transition.Her most recent CEO position was between 2003 and 2007 when she led Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) acquired in 2012.Unfortunately, at 66, she might not want to jump into such a challenge, especially since she’s already quite busy with her Ginger and Baker cafe and bakery in Fort Collins, Colorado.If the company wants to hit the ground running, she’s the perfect candidate.Maybe they can move Walgreens’ head office to Fort Collins. It would sure make it easier for Graham to consider the job seriously.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It's just like, you feel like, is there a chance maybe there wasn't fruit in some of these drinks? Sure. Starbucks is a busy place. There's actually maybe a legitimate chance that there was no fruit or not enough fruit or that's kind of how the service industry works, I think, from a consumer standpoint. If you're going all the time and you're not getting what you want, maybe go to a different restaurant. I don't really-- sometimes I feel like some of this gets a little bit blown out of proportion, I guess.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So I mean, I guess, we're kind of echoing the thing like shocker Starbucks doesn't put real fruit in their drinks, right? But I guess the difference is that mango acai dragonfruit whatever had no dragonfruit or acai in it, right?BROOKE DIPALMA: Right.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So the judge said, quote, that he rejected dismissal of the court of the case before, going to trial saying, ""A significant portion of reasonable consumers would expect their drinks to contain the fruit mentioned in their names.""BROOKE DIPALMA: Right.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So I think that's true. But I think we're also in that point like, I buy Fruit Loops. Am I going to get fruit in the Fruit Loops? I mean, you know--BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. How far can this go?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: There's like this whole like, what's the flavor like, as opposed to what's really in it. So they didn't say 100% dragonfruit, did they? So I see this going either way.JOSH SCHAFER: And those refreshers are pretty good, let's be honest. But do you--BROOKE DIPALMA: The dried fruit in them, always.JOSH SCHAFER: But do you buy them for the dried fruit? No, you buy it because it tastes like dragon fruit or something like or passion fruit or whatever it is. I don't even want the fruit.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think you made a good point about how the cold beverage business is huge for them. So this is kind of a problem, right?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And also, too, I was speaking to our legal reporter Alexis Keenan about this. And she said that maybe here they could have a real case if they say that there's fruit within the beverage or they advertise it as a strawberry acai beverage, there was no fruit. There was-- maybe there is a case here.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's strawberry but not dragon fruit.BROOKE DIPALMA: And Alexis also got into two other lawsuits that Starbucks has found themselves in years ago. She was telling me that there was-- they used a coloring from a beetle. And so that's what made their strawberry frappuccinos red and pink, right? And it was FDA-approved and legal to use. But that also got into a bit of a taboo with the people who necessarily were vegans or perhaps, obviously, did not want this coloring.JOSH SCHAFER: Brooke, you know my easy solution here. What's my Starbucks drink?BROOKE DIPALMA: Black coffee.JOSH SCHAFER: If you just drink black coffee, you won't have this problem. That's my advice.BROOKE DIPALMA: I love a good strawberry acai.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. Even iced. You know, you can put it on ice, that's fine. Then you're going to get ice and black coffee. Nothing will be mixed up.]"

Now Brooke, you've been keeping an eye on the company's investment in China. So what can you tell us about this?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well shares under pressure this morning after the company made a big announcement in China. They've been planning the launch of this center, this manufacturing and distribution center for nearly two years now. And shares falling a bit in early trading here. And they're ultimately saying that they're betting big on China.They recently announced a new Co-Chief Executive Officer, Molly her name. She comes in October 2nd. And the company really betting big here with this China Coffee Innovation Park that is opening today, on Tuesday. But. Ultimately. This has once again been a long time coming for China's Starbucks ramp up in China. They plan to open 9,000 stores in total. They currently have nearly 6,500.But many experts that I spoke to both say it's an opportunity, but there are challenges, as well, that Starbucks faces as they make a play into China. One of those challenges include, China headwinds are likely to get stronger rather than weaker, as consumers move past the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns. And Leland Miller, who's a friend of the show, also said there is no immunity to US-China geopolitical tensions, despite Starbucks really trying to outweigh the odds here.Story continuesBut some opportunities here is a potential to franchise. We know that former CEO, Howard Schultz, was against franchising. They do own their stores there, previously they had licensed stores there. And so perhaps with Howard Schultz stepping down from the board last week, there could be a potential opportunity to franchise the business there, like we saw with other fast food giants.But, ultimately, at the end of the day, the opportunity here that Belinda Wong, who is the Chairwoman there for Starbucks Chinese business, is just a potential coffee market that is yet to be tapped in China. We know that Chinese consumers only drink about 12 cups per year, which is why it is so--[INTERPOSING VOICES]- My God, that's insane.- 6,500, stores simply amazing. Another 15,000, if 16,000 in the US. Thank you for that Brooke DiPalma.]"

And first up, we've got to take a look at Starbucks because shares are on the move. We got a call out from TD Cowen downgrading this stock from outperform to perform in line here, and lowering its price target by about $10 a share. We're looking at the stock off about 1 and 1/2% in pre-market trading.Now, the team there pointing to weakness out of China and the risk that then poses to same-store sales in the country. And Brad, when you take a look at China, it certainly is a key growth driver for Starbucks. They have about 6,500 locations throughout China. They posted relatively impressive numbers going back to last quarter. That year over year growth of 46%, not a huge surprise given the fact that China was in lockdown just about a year ago. But the fact that we haven't seen this recovery really pick up in what many forecasters had been expecting, companies with a large exposure to China like Starbucks here are at risk.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Spot on. And so even with the difficulties that they're shouting out here with regard to China, in the US, they are saying that they still like the playbook here. Most notably one of the things that they did call out highlighting a 60-plus percent increase in Starbucks rewards loyalty members versus pre-COVID-19. The increasing mix of high margin ice beverages here for all of those-- do they still serve the unicorn frappuccino?Story continues- You should know because you might be a Starbucks'-- one of their most loyal customers.BRAD SMITH: Well, recently yes.- Oh, that's a new thing.BRAD SMITH: Recently, yes. Because of proximity and because of adjusting of my own morning routine, and they actually call that morning routines within this note, too. So noteworthy that you brought that up. They said their morning-oriented business track changes in payrolls as changes in the number of commuters naturally impact morning routines, like my own. So all of that considered, they still like the US playbook here.We'll see how that continues to nurture itself here. But you really think about this, especially within the US as a kind of pre-pandemic versus post-pandemic kind of drivers of continued growth within the business. And no doubt some of the adjustment of morning routines pre-pandemic versus post pandemic now certainly going to be in focus for this company.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sysco. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Sysco already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sysco, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sysco. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Sysco Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$70m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Sysco. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, despite its convincing performance, its stock is down 8.21% year-to-date.To be fair, it’s no secret that inflation and volatile commodity costs have been the boogeymen of the food sphere, but this is one of the best stocks to buy for because it’s resilient.Yet, Sysco, with its unmatched pricing, might be poised to weather these stormy seas.

Its second-quarter sales clocked in at a robust $20.6 billion, reflecting a hearty 11.3% year-over-year growth.Complementing this is an impressive earnings-per-share of 53 cents,  marking a remarkable 30% year-over-year increment.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to Semiconductor R&amp;D Spending By Country: Top 5.The Global Semiconductor IndustrySemiconductors are at the core of our digital economy and have numerous applications in many industries, including communication, healthcare, automotive, and military systems. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market was valued at $573.44 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $ 1.3 trillion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2%. China currently holds the largest share of the semiconductor market. However, North America has been estimated to grow the most during the forecast period, and R&amp;D will be the key driver for this growth.The communication and networking segment currently has the largest share of the semiconductor market. It will contribute significantly to the growth of the semiconductor industry in Europe during the forecast period. The surge in demand has also shifted the attention of Europe towards semiconductor innovation and R&amp;D, which could fuel the market's growth in the future. Some of the largest companies in the semiconductor industry are expanding their research and entering new markets to keep up with the booming demand. On September 12, Reuters reported that IQE plc (LON:IQE) intends to penetrate new markets and is exploring growth opportunities, especially in the artificial intelligence space. The CEO of the company mentioned that they will be delivering new 'wireless and WiFi' products to the Chinese and Indian markets. AI has catalyzed the demand for semiconductors globally. GaN Power Electronics by the company is an energy-efficient product that can be used in a variety of AI applications. The surge in demand combined with technological advancement has formed the perfect amalgamation that can fuel the growth of IQE plc (LON:IQE) in the future.Story continuesIncreased collaboration between companies based on R&amp;D and sharing intellectual property nurtures overall semiconductor ecosystem capabilities. On August 14, Reuters reported that Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have signed a deal combining their faculties to facilitate growth. The design portfolio from Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) will be working with the advanced manufacturing capabilities of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) wants to improve the performance of its chips and this deal could greatly benefit Intel's 18A process.Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, many semiconductor companies have stood strong. On August 23, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $2.70 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.63. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $13.51 billion, up 101.48% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $2.42 billion. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on investors' radars recently as the hype around AI continues to fuel the demand for its chips. As of September 18, shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have surged over 207% year to date.The Semiconductor Tug Of WarThe surge in demand in the past few years has triggered a global semiconductor shortage crisis. Many countries and governments have been stepping up to encounter this challenge. In August 2022, the American government enacted the CHIPS and Science Act to facilitate the semiconductor industry, cater to global challenges, and reinforce the country's national security. According to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the CHIPS and Science Act brought almost $200 billion in private investments for the semiconductor ecosystem.The rising geopolitical tensions have also made countries and governments more conscious of the future of their semiconductor industries. The US and China have been the epicenter of these rising tensions. The strain is impacting the global semiconductor supply chain as the US government started regulating the sales of semiconductor chips to China. The tug-of-war between the two superpowers over semiconductors has been very persistent. On September 15, Reuters reported that the US House Republicans are pressing for a crackdown on the Chinese companies Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (HKG:0981). The lawmakers are urging the Biden administration and Commerce Department to halt the issuance of licenses to the Chinese government and impose stricter control on exports to Chinese companies. The letter from the House urges the Commerce Department to revoke all existing licenses the two companies have as well.The US Department of Commerce has catalyzed the process for the implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act to protect its interests. The first notice of funding (NOFO) was released by the e CHIPS Program Office (CPO) in March 2023. The NOFO was directed at companies elaborating on the necessary procedure to receive semiconductor incentives to help them construct and expand commercial fabrication facilities (fabs). Another opportunity was released in June, especially targeting the semiconductor manufacturing projects over $300 million. According to the report by SIA, more funding opportunities and a targeted prospect for R&amp;D facilities are expected to be announced in the coming months.Semiconductor Race Of The GovernmentsGovernments across the world have become active participants in the semiconductor race. The semiconductor market development is on the Chinese government's agenda, especially considering the rising geopolitical tensions. The Chinese government has income tax exemptions for advanced technology process nodes to stimulate the integrated circuits industry's development locally. The government also has a dedicated chip fund named China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, or the 'big fund,' adding almost $50 billion. The Chinese government is poised to tackle all challenges and achieve its goal of a flourishing local chip market.On September 5, Reuters reported that the Chinese government is setting up another investment fund to raise $40 billion for the semiconductor sector. It will be the third and largest fund launched by the government under the big fund. The fund will bring China closer to achieving self-sufficiency in the semiconductor market.The European Commission passed the EU Chips Act in April 2023, intended to double Europe's share in global chip production by 2030. This goal will be achieved by mobilizing almost $47 billion in public and private investment. The EU Chips Act will cover everything from old chips to new advanced chips and R&amp;D.The Japanese government is also investing heavily in chip manufacturing, as evidenced by its funding to Rapidus, a state-organized joint chip venture. The Japanese government wants to achieve the commercial production of semiconductor chips in the country. According to the report by SIA, the Japanese government added a supplement of $2.8 billion to the annual budget to facilitate private chipmaking.The South Korean government passed the K-Chips Act in March 2023. The Act provides tax credits to companies working on industries of national strategic importance, including semiconductors. In April, the South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Enterprise announced allocating almost 70% of its budget to R&amp;D. The 70% budget allocation corresponds to $4.7 billion, which will help many core industries enhance their R&amp;D in the coming years. In January, the Taiwanese government also approved amendments to the Taiwan Chips Act. The Taiwan Chips Act offers a 25% tax reduction for R&amp;D.Semiconductor R&amp;D Spending By Country: Top 12Dragon Images/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of top countries spending the most money on semiconductor R&amp;D, we initially sifted through reports from SIA. We found the R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of sales for the countries that contribute the most. However, the data we found did not give the exact expenditure breakdowns for each country. We continued our research building on the hypothesis that the countries that export the most semiconductors spend the most on semiconductors R&amp;D. We have sourced our data for a percentage share of global semiconductor sales from OEC World. However, the latest data available for this metric was for 2021; therefore, we have considered the 2021 values for R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of sales as well, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. We have used R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of sales as our primary metric and percentage share of global semiconductor exports as our secondary metric. The list has been arranged in ascending order of our primary metric.Semiconductor R&amp;D Spending By Country: Top 1212. ChinaR&amp;D Expenditure as a Percentage of Sales in 2021: 7.6%Percentage Share of Global Semiconductor Exports in 2021: 39%China is one of the largest countries in the semiconductor market. The country has been persistently investing 7.6% of sales into R&amp;D and invested the same percentage in 2022. The geopolitical tensions with the US had the semiconductor industry at its center. China is focused on moving towards self-sufficiency and, therefore, is investing heavily in R&amp;D as well.11. JapanR&amp;D Expenditure as a Percentage of Sales in 2021: 8.3%Percentage Share of Global Semiconductor Exports in 2021: 8.77%Japan is one of the top semiconductor-producing countries in the world. The country invested 8.3% of the total sales in R&amp;D in 2021 and 2022. It is one of the biggest players in the Asia Pacific region, and semiconductor R&amp;D plays a vital role in maintaining this position.10. South KoreaR&amp;D Expenditure as a Percentage of Sales in 2021: 9.1%Percentage Share of Global Semiconductor Exports in 2021: 3.93%South Korea has one of the highest semiconductor R&amp;D spending by country. South Korea spent 9.1% of sales on R&amp;D in both 2021 and 2022. The country has a notable standing in the semiconductor market in Asia Pacific, and R&amp;D would contribute to sustaining this position long term. 9. TaiwanR&amp;D Expenditure as a Percentage of Sales in 2021: 11%Percentage Share of Global Semiconductor Exports in 2021: 5.42%Taiwan is one of the biggest semiconductor producers in the world. In 2021 and 2022, Taiwan spent 11% of sales on R&amp;D. The country has a strong foundation in semiconductor technology and a skilled workforce. Taiwan is well-positioned to sustain its position as a giant in the semiconductor industry.IQE plc (LON:IQE), Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are some of the most noteworthy companies in the semiconductor industry. 8.

Southwest provides short-haul, high-frequency, point-to-point, low-fare services. The company’s point-to-point route structure includes services to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, and Ft-Lauderdale-Hollywood.Low Cost = Low PerformanceLow-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Southwest Airlines have been dramatically underperforming their larger peers such as United Airlines (UAL).What is Behind the Underperformance?Unprofitable and moving in the wrong directionIn Q4, Southwest Airlines swung to a loss for the first time in three quarters. The 38-cent loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Adding to the disappointment, Southwest earned has seen three straight quarters of negative EPS growth.  Operational DisruptionsMassive flight cancellations due to extreme winter weather conditions adversely impacted Southwest’s operations. Because Southwest is more focused on one part of the globe when compared to its larger counterparts, the company suffered more. Nearly 17,000 flights were cancelled in the last ten days of 2022 – equating to a pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million.In Fighting &amp; Bad PublicitySouthwest is known and loved by its customers because of the laid-back nature of its flight attendants and employees. This laissez faire attitude is that Southwest management has found that many customers appreciate a less stuffy environment. However, that may change soon. Southwest pilots and employees are seeing little progress in trying to reach a new contract deal. If a strike is to take place, it will lead to even higher costs – especially since competitors like United and American Airlines (AAL) have already reached deals with their respective unions.Story continuesMargins are Being SqueezedRising fuel and labor costs are causing Southwest’s financial efficiency to take a significant hit. In fact, LUV’s return-on-equity of 5.81% pales in comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 26.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRelative Weakness: When it comes to the stock market, price action = truth. Over the past six months, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 15.90%, while Southwest is down 14.1%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNegative Earnings ESP Score Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) measures the chances a company will beat or miss on earnings. LUV has the unfortunate mix of a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a negative ESP – suggesting the company is likely to miss earnings when it reports October 26th.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionProspective airline investors should avoid low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and instead opt for larger players such as United Airlines. Southwest has slower growth, shrinking margins, and notable reputational damage to contend with.

PM stands in a favorable position to continue benefiting from its range of smoke-free products and competitive pricing strategy. These upsides have been working well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company amid cost inflation and soft cigarette volumes.Shares of this tobacco giant have risen 6.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 4.3%. The company also outpaced the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 1.8% in the same period.Factors Working WellConsumers have been increasingly moving toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives, driven by the growing awareness of the health risks associated with traditional cigarette smoking. PM is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of the company’s net revenues in the second quarter of 2023.The company is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the IQOS, its heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. These next-generation devices are backed by substantial scientific insights and research. The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). In the quarter, the company witnessed continued strength in IQOS performance, along with pricing power.Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking). For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. HTU shipment volumes are likely to be about 31-33 billion units in the third quarter.Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022. Management expects a robust performance from Swedish Match’s existing operations in 2023 due to the expectations of strong ZYN volumes in the United States.Philip Morris’ pricing power has been instrumental in maintaining its stability, even in the face of declining cigarette shipments. While raising prices could potentially result in reduced cigarette consumption, smokers often tolerate these price hikes due to the addictive nature of cigarettes. In the second quarter of 2023, higher pricing variance was an upside to PM’s revenue performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVolume &amp; Cost ConcernsThe overall cigarette industry has been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected Adult Tobacco Consumers’ spending patterns. Cigarette volumes, in general, have also been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives.In the second quarter of 2023, cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.4% to 157 billion units. In 2023, the total international industry volume for cigarettes and HTUs is estimated to decline in the range of 0.5-1.5%, excluding China and the United States. For Philip Morris, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decrease 1.5-2.5% in 2023.PM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income was somewhat affected by global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages. The adjusted operating margin of 39.4% contracted 1.4 percentage points year over year. The company expects to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA.Wrapping UpFor 2023, PM expects net revenues to increase by nearly 7.5-8.5% on an organic basis.  For the full-year 2023, management expects adjusted EPS in the band of $6.13-$6.22 compared with the $5.98 reported in 2022. Excluding currency movements, the adjusted EPS is envisioned in the band of $6.46-$6.55, suggesting 8-9.5% growth from the year-ago period figure.The company expects robust organic adjusted operating income growth in the second half of 2023, which is likely to fuel adjusted operating margin expansion. For the third quarter of 2023, Philip Morris expects adjusted EPS in the band of $1.60-$1.65. The EPS guidance reflects organic top-line growth in the high single digits, among other factors. The company also expects a meaningfully solid performance in the fourth quarter.Solid Consumer Staple BetsInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) will state in a speech today. He will explain the role smoke-free products can play in ending cigarette smoking globally and the human consequences of inaction.""For over a decade, PMI has championed a smoke-free future. Having invested more than $10.5 billion to scientifically research, develop, and commercialize smoke-free products—which today account for more than a third of our total net revenues—we are living this future,"" says Olczak. ""Yet, inexplicably, there are countries stuck in the past where smokers can easily access cigarettes—the most harmful form of nicotine consumption—but not the better option of smoke-free alternatives.""Using the World Health Organization’s data, estimates, and methodologies, along with other third-party data, PMI calculated the potential public health impact of the world’s smokers switching from cigarettes to less harmful, smoke-free products. The hypothetical model shows that if smoke-free products are assumed to be 80 percent less risky than cigarettes and if people who currently smoke were to switch to them completely, then over their lifetime, there’s a potential for a tenfold reduction in smoking-attributable deaths compared with historical tobacco control measures alone.Story continuesIn a world that demands change, people are counting on their governments to keep up with technological advancements while ensuring innovations are appropriately regulated. According to a new international survey conducted by independent research firm Povaddo for PMI, more than half of global respondents (56 percent) believe their government needs to consider the role better alternatives such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products can play in eradicating cigarette use in their country.Moreover, 8 in 10 global respondents (82 percent) agree they would be somewhat or very angry, frustrated, or upset to learn that a breakthrough that could help address a societal issue was not made available to the public due to government inaction, and 88 percent agree that public health authorities should fully embrace and seek to learn from evidence and data from other countries.During a streamed broadcast via Reuters’ (@ReutersPlus) on X (formerly Twitter) today at 10am ET, Olczak explains that, while there are limitations to any hypothetical analysis, real-world examples from countries that accept tobacco harm reduction confirm its positive impact.Public health data show1, for instance, that Sweden has one of the lowest smoking rates in the developed world, at just 5.8 percent. This is largely due to the availability of snus—a moist oral tobacco product—which Swedish men began switching to decades ago. Today, male mortality rates due to tobacco are much lower in Sweden2 compared with other European Union countries, where snus is banned. Putting that in perspective, the Swedish Snus Commission estimates that more than 350,000 smoking-attributable deaths among men could have been avoided each year if the other EU countries had matched Sweden’s tobacco-related mortality rate.There is also compelling evidence from Japan. In 2019—five years after heated tobacco products were introduced in that country—independent studies3 showed an unprecedented decline in cigarette sales. The U.K., which has adopted smoke-free products to help adults abandon cigarettes, has also seen smoking rates fall significantly.4""Innovations become advancements when they address existing issues and offer improvements. Decades ago, our industry was challenged to make cigarettes less harmful. We have delivered, creating science-based alternatives that remove combustion, the primary factor in smoking-related disease,"" says Olczak. ""It is no longer a case of if smoke-free alternatives are better than cigarette smoking; it is a case of by how much.""A video of Olczak’s full speech will be accessible here from 10am ET and additional information on PMI’s hypothetical model is available at pmi.com/rethinkdisruption.Survey MethodologyPovaddo conducted the online survey on behalf of PMI between March 30 and April 20, 2023. The survey was fielded among 30,591 general population adults aged 21 or older in 15 countries: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Tunisia, United Kingdom, and United States. Approximately 2,000 interviews were collected in each country. Data have been weighted by age, gender, and nicotine product use per market to match national statistics. Results are accurate to a margin of error of +/- 1 percent.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate, and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match—a leader in oral nicotine delivery—creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General Snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of June 30, 2023, PMI’s smoke-free products were available for sale in 80 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 19.4 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35.4 percent of PMI’s total second-quarter 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is involved in supplying and transporting electricity and natural gas to customers in the northern and central regions of California, USA. On August 7, UBS analyst Gregg Orrill raised PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target, up from $19, noting that lower wildfire threats and constructive California regulations lend the company an optimistic outlook. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is one of the best recession stocks to buy.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 51 hedge funds were bullish on PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), one down from the previous quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the top stakeholder of the firm with 54 million shares worth over $933 million.Third Point Management made the following comment about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our strategy is to preserve liquidity and buying power to take advantage of markets when they “break”. While overall indices remain elevated, we are finding more chances to provide liquidity across all three asset classes in which we invest – credit, structured credit, and equity – opportunities which have been key drivers of performance for the fund. Our portfolio is balanced across industries with a focus on event-driven names including companies involved in spin-offs, significant cost-cutting, or other types of under-appreciated business transformation. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), which is still our largest position, continues to deliver strong performance, down 50bps in the first quarter but up 6.2% for the year to date after the Fire Victims Trust sold another 60 million shares in a block trade.”8. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) functions as a retailer and provider of automotive aftermarket components, tools, materials, machinery, and add-ons within the United States and Mexico. On July 26, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) reported a Q2 GAAP EPS of $10.22, beating the Wall Street estimates by $0.14. The revenue of $4.07 billion increased 10.9% year-over-year, also topping market consensus by $60 million. During recessionary periods, the auto repair market becomes quite costly, causing most people to do minor fixes themselves. This usually leads to an increase in sales for automotive parts and tools, making O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) one of the best recession stocks to invest in.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), same as the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the top stakeholder of the firm with 1.11 million shares worth approximately $1.06 billion.The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) – ORLY outperformed during Q2 led by share gains in its Pro business. Despite macro uncertainties, demand remains strong as customers are prioritizing the repair and maintenance of vehicles. ORLY remains the gold standard for service, part availability, and logistics in this industry. ORLY has a strong balance sheet, and has a good record of effective share repurchase.Reduced: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) – Reduced ORLY twice during Q2, reflecting strong recent performance that resulted in a relatively high valuation. ORLY remains well positioned for growth and leads the auto parts industry, which is fairly insulated from economic turbulence.”7. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco enterprise striving to create a smoke-free future by developing a long-term product lineup that extends beyond the realm of tobacco and nicotine.

(NYSE:PM), one down from the prior quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is the largest stakeholder of the firm, with approximately 15.8 million shares worth $1.54 billion.Ariel International Fund made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead. Furthermore, at current trading levels, we think the company’s operating leverage, pricing power, and free cash flow profile offer a margin of safety.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power, from sources like wind, solar, nuclear, coal, and natural gas, to both individual consumers and businesses in North America. On July 27, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed to shareholders on September 15.

(NYSE:NEE), same as the last quarter.

This award honors female supply chain leaders and executives whose accomplishments, mentorship and examples set a foundation for women in all levels of a company’s supply chain network. Misty was chosen for her work for one of IntelliTran's biggest clients, a large, global CPG producer, helping the business save millions in freight bills by better auditing that eliminated late fees.“I am so honored for being recognized for the work I have been doing to help save my client millions in their transport operations,” says Misty Sobanski, Engagement Manager at IntelliTrans. “Receiving the Women in the Supply Chain Award is a testament to the hard work of my team and the strength of our transportation solutions and services.”“This year, we received over 400 submissions, the highest amount of applications not only for this award but also for all of our awards. What's more, 118 of those applications were submitted by male counterparts, nominating their boss, co-worker or associate. Last year, that figure was just at 75. Also, this year, 39 women self-nominated, a tremendous uptick from last year's award, which just saw 12 self-nominations. This shows progress.

Congratulations to all the winners, those who nominated others, and the bravery of those who nominated themselves,"" adds Sarah Barnes-Humphrey, founder of the Let's Talk Supply Chain podcast and Blended Pledge project, both exclusive sponsors of the Women in Supply Chain award.As the Engagement Manager, Misty is responsible for building and maintaining customer relationships on-site at a Global Fortune 500 customer, overseeing the execution and delivery of SaaS-based technology and service offerings, which include but are not limited to bulk transportation procurement, shipment execution, driving problem resolution, freight invoice auditing, leading process improvements and delivering value by optimizing the customer's transportation and supply chain network by leveraging company technology and maximizing employee utilization. Misty looked at the raw materials the company was shipping and found opportunities of $8M last year where they could save money. Per the client's contract with IntelliTrans, IntelliTrans is only required to find $4.5M of savings – so Misty went above and beyond the contract.Another example of what she does for the client is using load optimization software and a dashboard to see how much the client fills their tankers with raw materials. For some commodities, the client was only filling them to 80%. She suggested they fill them to at least 90%, which created savings of over $2M.Go to https://foodl.me/fdx1zi to view the complete list of winners.

147,3880c8eb-8dfe-36f3-b00f-0618845766c6,HCA,2023-09-20,5 Hospital Stocks to Watch Amid Improving Industry Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hospital-stocks-watch-amid-121100287.html,1695125460,STORY,"['HCA', 'CYH', 'THC', 'UHS']","[Cost optimization and technological innovation are aiding the Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players. Their margins are further propelled by easing staffing challenges. Improving market conditions as seniors are now undergoing delayed elective procedures are boosting patient days and occupancies, which, in turn, is aiding hospitals’ top line. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological implementations are expected to offer companies a competitive edge with improved efficiency. Industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH are expected to benefit from these developments.Industry Overview The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends Defining the Hospital Industry's FutureCost Optimization: The rising patient volumes, prices of hospital supplies and inflationary pressures are likely to increase hospitals’ operating costs. The improvement in labor and staffing challenges will continue to provide them some breathing room. These companies are expected to increase labor productivity and implement new technologies to optimize expenses. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Story continuesTechnological Advancements: The hospital players are embracing the digital age as technological innovations and wider adoption continue to support growth. This will optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs, increase convenience and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to continue on their growth path. The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis, which will limit patients' waiting time and decrease their treatment costs.Patient Volume Growth: Seniors are now undergoing deferred elective procedures as pandemic-related constraints are fast vanishing. Hence, pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is driving patient volumes. Although inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and similar safety nets can help them navigate through tough times.Rising Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are expected to stimulate constant growth in the senior population. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, the percentage of this segment is likely to reach 22% by 2050 from 16.9% witnessed in 2020. The change in demographics and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, more people signing up for healthcare plans through the ACA indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy OutlookThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #46, which places it in the top 18% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to buy or watch, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite, as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this period, the stocks in this industry have gained 17.7% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s rise of 14.5%. The Zacks Medical sector has declined 1.5% during this time.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.67X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 13.29X and the sector’s 9.87X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.55X and as low as 5.57X, with a median of 7.81X, as the charts below show.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years)5 Stocks Worth Your AttentionBelow we have presented two stocks with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and three stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its telemedicine business line is likely to continue increasing the top line. It is well-poised to grow on the back of expanding patient volumes and growing admissions. Its Managed Medicare and Medicaid operations are expected to benefit top-line growth. HCA’s inorganic growth strategy enables it to scale its business. It also focuses on boosting shareholders’ value with dividend hikes and repurchases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 EPS indicates 9.2% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 6% increase from a year ago. HCA Healthcare beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 5.4%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have jumped 26.8% over the past year.Price &amp; Consensus: HCA Tenet Healthcare Corporation: The company provides diversified healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare units. It is witnessing growth in Ambulatory Care and Hospital segments, thanks to rising patient volumes and emergency room visits. Its solid USPI performance is a major contributor to the Ambulatory Care unit. Continuous buyouts and tuck-in acquisitions are aiding the company. It also benefits from contractual rate increases in the Conifer unit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THC’s 2023 bottom line is pegged at $5.73 per share, which improved 2.3% over the past 60 days. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 5.8% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 25.9%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 23.2% over the past year.Price &amp; Consensus: THC Universal Health Services: The company operates acute care facilities, and outpatient and behavioral health care units. It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma, and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. UHS has been gaining traction from higher patient days and an expansive care network. The rising number of licensed beds in acute care hospitals and joint ventures in the behavioral health portfolio is likely to aid its growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s 2023 bottom line indicates 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals a 5.9% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, the average surprise being 4.7%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3. Shares of the company have gained 32.6% in the past year.Price &amp; Consensus: UHS Acadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Improving patient volumes, admissions and extension of its service lines into new states are aiding the company’s performance. It is on track to add 300 beds to its existing facilities this year and inaugurate six comprehensive treatment centers. However, rising expenses are keeping its margins under check while high debt remains concerning. Though shares of ACHC have declined 14.8% in the past year, its strong operations are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC’s 2023 bottom line indicates 12.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2023 revenues signals a 10.4% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 2.8%.Price &amp; Consensus: ACHC Community Health Systems: It is a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the United States. Rising patient volumes, admissions and improved occupancy rates are boosting the company’s results. Its focus on telehealth is expected to position the company for long-term growth. Community Health also does not shy away from divesting non-core assets to boost profitability, same-store metrics and cash flow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CYH’s 2023 bottom line indicates a 55.1% improvement from a year ago. The consensus mark for its 2023 revenues signals 1.7% growth from the prior year.

A solid 2023 guidance also acts as an additional tailwind for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCigna presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The stock has gained 3.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 3.1% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreCI is well-poised for progress, as evidenced by its impressive VGM Score of A. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CI’s 2023 earnings and revenues is pegged at $24.8 per share and $191.6 billion, indicating an improvement of 6.6% and 6.1%, respectively, from the year-ago readings.Cigna’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.6%.Optimistic Guidance for 2023This year, Cigna anticipates adjusted revenues at a minimum of $190 billion, which indicates growth of at least 5.2% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be a minimum of $24.70, which suggests a minimum growth of 6.1% from the 2022 figure.Business TailwindsCigna derives a majority of its revenues from pharmacy services and premiums. A growing specialty business and rising customer base should enhance pharmacy revenues and premiums. The company expects medical customers to grow by at least 1.4 million customers in 2023.Cigna’s performance continues to benefit from the strength of its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. A solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, while the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from an expansive customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses.Express Scripts, Cigna’s pharmacy benefits business, should continue to drive pharmacy revenues by the strength of its supply chain, care and clinical management programs and adding three biosimiliars to the largest formulary. Accredo, CI’s flagship specialty pharmacy, is expected to grow at an accelerated pace and increase its contribution to the Evernorth segment in the future. The company expects mid-single digits and mid-to-high single-digits growth in the third and fourth quarters due to higher adoption of biosimiliars.Story continuesThe U.S. Commercial business is expected to benefit from its competitive position and strong customer growth. U.S. Government business and International business should continue their growth trajectory with high-quality plans and geographic expansion. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain a solid demand for its Medicare plans, which falls under the Government business.In addition to the solid inflow of premiums, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.CI resorts to acquisitions to bolster its suite of solutions and capabilities, as well as step into newer geographies and solidify its presence in existing markets. The company is on track to implement its Centene contract beginning in 2024. Cigna collaborated with CarepathRx Health System Solutions to accelerate and expand pharmacy care delivery to a rising number of patients with complex care needs. This would add to its existing offerings and benefit Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth’s clients.A growing cash balance and robust cash-generating abilities will continue to empower Cigna in undertaking business growth investments and prudently deploying capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In February 2023, management approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend. Its dividend yield of 1.7% is higher than the industry average of 1.4%. The company expects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $9.5 billion in 2023.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.The company has been experiencing an increase in pharmacy and other service costs, medical costs and other benefit expenses. Such costs tend to weigh on the company’s margins. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the medical space are HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA, Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM and Atai Life Sciences N.V. ATAI.

(NYSE:PPG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-institutional-ownership-ppg-industries-121622326.html,1695039382,STORY,['PPG'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, PPG Industries' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 17 shareholders own 51% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PPG Industries. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PPG Industries?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.PPG Industries already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PPG Industries' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PPG Industries. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PPG IndustriesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that PPG Industries, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$58m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in PPG Industries. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.Stock markets displayed volatility as traders prepared for the possibility of a hawkish message from major central banks convening this week to determine interest rates. Brent crude oil, a benchmark, surged beyond $95 per barrel, marking its highest level since November, raising worries about inflation. Oil industry giants such as TotalEnergies SE, BP Plc, and Shell Plc significantly influenced gains in Europe's Stoxx 600 benchmark index. In the United States, equity futures showed minimal movement. On the Chinese stocks front, BlackRock Strategists have revised their stance on Chinese stocks, downgrading them from overweight to neutral. This decision was influenced by concerns surrounding China's property sector and the belief that stimulus measures have not provided the anticipated boost. In a report published on September 18, the strategists, led by Jean Boivin, highlighted reasons for this downgrade, citing a slowdown in growth, less substantial policy stimulus compared to previous instances, ongoing structural challenges indicating deteriorating long-term growth, and the persistence of geopolitical risks.Across Europe, investor caution arose as the euro area's 10-year Bund yield surged to a 12-year high, reported Reuters. European Central Bank officials reiterated their commitment to stabilizing rates to control inflation. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a central ECB policymaker, emphasized maintaining rates at 4%, countering calls for higher rates. Market sentiment was cautious, with investors hesitating to invest despite expectations of interest rates peaking. Bund yields, currently at 2.70%, stabilized after recent selling pressure. The Federal Reserve's impending policy meeting, with expectations of a 25-basis-point rate hike, remained a focal point. Rising oil prices raised concerns of slowing disinflation, affecting bond prices. Italy's 10-year bond yield was at 4.50%, and the spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, indicating investor confidence, stood at 179 basis points. ECB policy hawks suggested ending bond reinvestments under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme earlier than the 2024 deadline, potentially impacting peripheral bond prices and monetary policy transmission. Markets remained cautious, monitoring central bank decisions and bond yield developments.Story continuesOn the precious metal side, gold prices held near two-week highs as the U.S. dollar retreated from a six-month peak, with central bank meetings in focus. Spot gold saw a slight 0.1% dip to $1,930.39 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures edged down 0.1% to $1,951.60. The dollar's decline made gold more attractive to foreign buyers ahead of key central bank decisions by the U.S., UK, and Japan. While the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged, it focuses on its future rate outlook. Fed Chair Powell will likely emphasize ongoing inflation risks but a wait-and-see approach. However, continued rate hikes to control inflation could dampen gold's appeal. In other metals, spot silver fell 0.2% to $23.18 per ounce, platinum eased 0.3% to $930.15, and palladium rose 0.5% to $1,242.01.In financial markets, notable equities such as OceanFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:OCFC) and PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTCT) have received downgrades from analysts among many other companies. To access a comprehensive list of stocks that have recently undergone downgrades by financial analysts, kindly refer to the complete article.Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 StocksPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash10. PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.01 (-0.13%)Established in 1999, the company is based in Irving, Texas. PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) and its subsidiaries offer omni-channel commerce solutions in multiple countries, including the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, and India. Their services encompass order-to-cash processing, order fulfillment, and contact center support. The latter includes essential services like order entry, returns authorization, product inquiries, and order tracking. They also provide the iCommerce Agent application, enabling agents to assist customers with various functions such as placing orders, checking order status, facilitating returns, upselling, cross-selling, managing escalations, and gathering customer feedback. PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) serves clients across diverse industries, including health, skincare, fragrance, cosmetics, fashion, luxury goods, consumer packaged goods, collectibles, jewelry, housewares, electronics, and more.On September 18, Craig-Hallum analyst George Sutton revised the rating for PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW), downgrading it from ""Buy"" to ""Hold."" In conjunction with this adjustment, he also reduced the price target for PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) from $11 to $7.50. These decisions had an immediate impact, with PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) stock price experiencing a marginal decline of 0.1%, settling at $7.43.09. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.21 (-0.60%)On September 18, Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) was downgraded by Desjardins from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" with a current stock price of $34.88, reflecting a decrease of 0.6%. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) is being downgraded due to limited return potential to the revised target price of $49.00, up from $48.00, and a more cautious outlook on future M&amp;A activity. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) stock surged by 10% after reporting second-quarter financial results in mid-August, ranking as the second-best performance in the Desjardins E&amp;P coverage universe. CEO Rich Kruger's successful efforts in cutting costs and streamlining non-core assets, especially after the recent UK North Sea disposition, are noted. Operational improvements and favorable commodity prices have also been beneficial. However, ConocoPhillips' consolidation of Surmont potentially sets back Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) Base Mine replacement plans as it nears its end-of-life in the mid-2030s, with production declines expected soon. The inevitable consolidation of TotalEnergies Canada's Fort Hills is expected, and SU may need to explore other M&amp;A opportunities, possibly at richer valuations, given the altered oil sands landscape. Most of the near-term catalysts have materialized, and other Canadian large caps offer more promising short-term upside potential.Artisan International Value Fund made the following comment about Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), a Canada-based operator of oil sands mines, refineries and retail gas stations, was the third-largest contributor to return for the year, mainly due to higher oil prices. The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.”08. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.04 (-0.84%)On September 18, Redburn-Atlantic analyst Kunaal Malde downgraded Global Payments (NYSE: GPN) from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell"" due to increased competition in the payment processing industry. The current stock price after the downgrade is $123.30, reflecting a decrease of 0.8%.Artisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable trims in the quarter included Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Teledyne Technologies and Envista Holdings. Global Payments is a provider of payments technology solutions for merchants. Increased competition in the fintech sector has weighed on the company’s valuation since the pandemic. While we expect Global Payments to continue to grow its sales and profits, the slowing economy presents a risk over the coming year. In addition, the recent retirement of the CEO raises questions about the vitality of the company’s profit cycle. While the valuation remains attractive, we harvested a portion of our position in favor of newer ideas with more visible profit acceleration.”07. Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.38 (-1.41%)On September 18, Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) experienced a 1.4% decline in its share price following a downgrade by William Blair. In explaining his decision, Analyst Jason Ader pointed to several factors warranting caution, with one key concern being the ""unimpressive outlook for organic revenue growth in 2024."" Consequently, Ader revised his rating on Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) from ""Outperform"" to ""Market Perform."" The downgrade by William Blair underscores the challenges and uncertainties that Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) faces in the near future. While the company has enjoyed previous periods of growth and positive market sentiment, concerns about its revenue outlook for 2024 have prompted this reevaluation by the analyst.Here is what Arch Capital specifically said about Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) in its Q2, 2022 Investor Letter:“In March, we decided to buy Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) with some of our cash position. We had sold the stock in 2021 due solely to valuation concerns, but with the stock cratering in early 2022, we decided to revisit the company. It turns out, the business was still as strong as ever. If you want more detail on why we like Dropbox, you can read our report from back in Q1 here.”06. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.55 (-1.99%)Founded in 1992, NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is based in San Jose, California. It delivers cloud-centric data services globally, enabling data management and sharing across on-premises, private, and public clouds. The company operates in two segments: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) offers intelligent data management software like NetApp ONTAP, storage infrastructure solutions including the All-Flash FAS series, and cloud storage and data services like NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP. They also provide application-aware data management via NetApp Astra and various professional and support services. Serving diverse industries, NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) operates through direct sales and partner networks. On September 18, William Blair's Jason Ader downgraded NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) from ""Outperform"" to ""Market Perform."" Ader noted that NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) cloud services have become a significant part of the business, contributing 8% of total revenue with cloud services ARR of $619 million and cloud revenue of $154 million in the most recent quarter ending July 31, 2023. However, despite doubling Cloud ARR over the past two years, growth has stalled in recent quarters, with Cloud ARR remaining flat sequentially and only increasing by 6% year-over-year in the latest quarter.Click to continue reading and see the Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Stocks That Will Double in 2023Stocks On the Rise: 13 Best To Buy Now12 Hot Penny Stocks On the MoveDisclosure: None.

Since then, payment stocks have plunged in value as business momentum slowed.But investors shouldn’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Online commerce will continue its inexorable growth, albeit perhaps at a slower rate, and the firms making that possible stand to benefit. These three payment stocks, in particular, are set to profit from e-commerce, digital wallets and other such emerging trends.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) is a financial services company that has three main operational categories: merchant solutions, issuer solutions, and consumer solutions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIts merchant business is the firm’s bread-and-butter, accounting for around two-thirds of revenues. In short, Global Payments provides all the infrastructure for retailers to accept customers’ funds, provide accounting and tax functions, manage fund safety and security and so on.Global Payments is focused on delivering the omnichannel shopping experience. Whether customers want to pay with a card in a physical store, buy online with a card, or use newer options such as digital wallets, Global Payments gives merchants the tools to make that a frictionless experience.GPN stock rallied in 2023 so far, with shares rising about 25% year-to-date. Regardless, the firm remains dirt cheap at 12 times its fast-growing earnings. Morningstar’s Brett Horn sees fair value at $179 per share, offering massive upside versus today’s price.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) went from an absolute trader darling to a total pariah over the past two years. Shares plunged from a peak of more than $300 in 2021 to barely $60 per share today.It’s not hard to see what went wrong. The adoption of e-commerce and touchless payment solutions slowed after the initial boom during the early days of the pandemic. Competition also got more fierce within the industry. Meanwhile, PYPL stock was trading at a lofty valuation in 2021, and that has come in sharply as well.Story continuesHowever, I’d argue this may be an overreaction in the opposite direction today. While PayPal’s operational momentum has slowed a bit, this is still a growth company now selling at a value price.Analysts see the company’s revenues rising around 8% to nearly $30 billion this year, with that jumping to $32 billion in 2024 and even higher over the next five years. Earnings per share are set to rise nearly 20% this year and grow at double-digits in future years as well. Meanwhile, shares are now going for just 12 times forward earnings. PayPal may be a fallen giant, but it’s far from being a hopeless one.Paysafe (PSFE)Paysafe (PSFE) Card Iphone Screen with Keyboard and Pencils on a White DeskSource: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.comPaysafe (NYSE:PSFE) is a smaller company offering investors a great deal of exposure to the mobile and digital wallet ecosystem.The firm came about as a digital-first payments solution seeking to create technology to handle fast-evolving new categories such as online gaming, digital gift cards and online cash and money transfer solutions. Among these fields, it operates digital wallets, allowing customers to move funds and buy things online in a secure manner. Paysafe even supports more specialized functions such as operating embedded digital wallets for online trading of financial assets like cryptocurrency.Paysafe went public via a SPAC at a high valuation, as was common a few years ago. With PSFE stock now down nearly 90% from its initial price, however, shares have become a reasonable bet.That’s especially true as the firm swung to profitability on an earnings-per-share basis and it continues to grow the top-line at a respectable rate. With a market cap of just over $800 million, shares now sell at a sharp discount to the firm’s $1.5 billion in annual revenues.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in GPN stock.

One such stock that merits attention is SLB (NYSE:SLB). The stock, which is currently priced at 61.69, recorded a gain of 1.83% in a day and a 3-month increase of 28.79%. The stock's fair valuation is $112.73, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with SLB. Click here to check it out. SLB 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLBThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.SLB (SLB): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationSLB (NYSE:SLB): A Closer LookSLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions. It maintains a reputation as one of the industry's leading innovators, which has earned it dominant share in numerous end markets.However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with SLB should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-score. Additionally, the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is SLB a hidden gem or a value trap?Story continuesDeclining Revenues and Earnings: A Red FlagOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of SLB, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 23.55; 2020: 21.34; 2021: 15.40; 2022: 17.30; 2023: 21.63; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-5.7%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for SLB's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.SLB (SLB): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationThe Value Trap DilemmaDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, SLB's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In SLB's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the declining revenues and earnings, alongside other risk indicators, it is reasonable to suggest that SLB might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors are advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Aptiv's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Aptiv How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aptiv is:10% = US$982m ÷ US$9.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Aptiv's Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, Aptiv seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. However, while Aptiv has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 18% . We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Aptiv's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 11% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is APTV worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether APTV is currently mispriced by the market.Is Aptiv Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Aptiv has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

He suggested platforms can consider an appropriate health warning to be displayed when users log in.Following the discussions, India's Health Secretary Sudhansh Pant ""noted the harmful effects of tobacco use and concerns represented by the stakeholders and said that pragmatic solutions for operationalization and compliance ... would be looked into in the larger interest of public health,"" the minutes added.Story continuesThe discussions - being reported by Reuters for the first time - signal India could change the rules or relax them in some way. It is not clear if, and when, the health ministry will change the rules.The Health and I&amp;B ministries did not respond to Reuters queries. Netflix, Amazon and Ambani's Viacom18 did not respond, while Disney declined comment. The four were among many companies that attended the Aug. 28 meeting.Health activists have welcomed the new rules, saying tobacco kills 1.3 million people each year in India and the growing popularity of streaming platforms means they must be treated at par with cinemas and TV, where all smoking and alcohol drinking scenes require health warnings.In 2013, Woody Allen stopped his film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning about mandatory anti-tobacco warnings would be inserted into its smoking scenes.During the meeting, streaming firms supported the rules in spirit, but highlighted implementation challenges. They committed to ""displaying a disclaimer at the beginning"" of content and no promotion of tobacco products on their platforms, the minutes stated.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Netflix (NFLX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.53 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 17, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $3.53 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.49 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Netflix has an Earnings ESP of 1.35%.NFLX is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is American Woodmark (AMWD).Slated to report earnings on November 28, 2023, American Woodmark holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.96 a share 71 days from its next quarterly update.American Woodmark's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 9.04% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80.Story continuesNFLX and AMWD's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TJX has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ROST likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TJX has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ROST currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.61, while TJX has a forward P/E of 24.89. We also note that ROST has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.24.Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 9.04. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Khan argues that these mergers can snowball into larger monopolies when left unchecked. Senior Reporter for Yahoo Finance Anjalee Khemlani joins to breakdown Lina Khan's recent statement at the Oliver Wyman Health Innovation Summit in Chicago.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Moving on mergers and acquisitions in the health care space is a target for the Federal Trade Commission, its chair has said. An event in Chicago Monday, Lina Khan outlined how data the FTC has been analyzing showed below the radar deals worth millions over time has created monopolies. Yahoo's Anjalee khemlani was at the event. What can you tell us?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. We all know that, of course, the FTC released some guidelines, proposed guidelines, earlier this year. And that came to an end in terms of public comments on Monday, the same day that FTC chair Lina Khan was talking about just what prompted that change. We know that of course, the company-- the agency has been looking at breaking up monopolies or at least challenging some of these acquisitions. We saw earlier this year, of course, the Amgen and Horizon Therapeutics deal, which did get to finally go through and is slated to close later this year.But at the event, talking about the DOJ and FTC looking at how they're going to start scrutinizing mergers, FTC Chair Khan said, quote, ""We've seen a whole lot of deals that are below our radar, that are kind of slowly and incrementally consolidating a market. And then five years in, 10 years in, you have two to three players that have come to dominate. And that below the radar deal, she's referring to, is those that are under $100 million. And that's because both the agencies do not have to get notified of every single deal that comes through.And so in these proposal forms that the companies have to file, they're going to start looking at collecting data on what these past deals have been for the merging companies, whether or not that includes some of these below-radar deals, and start to collect and accumulate more data that tells the tale. Retrospective studies have shown that, in fact, these are the kinds of deals that have been causing what we see as current day, you know, larger firms monopolies. And of course, that has been largely hospitals and major deals in the health care space.But this goes beyond that. Now, with other players like the tech industry also involved in health care, it's going to be opening the door for greater scrutiny of these deals.]"

It really can be life or death for people, and so that's why this is a particular area of focus for us,"" Khan said at the Oliver Wyman Health Innovation Summit in Chicago Monday.The agency under Khan's leadership has been more focused on challenging M&amp;A activity in healthcare and tech. Notably the agency challenged pharma giant Amgen's (AMGN) acquisition of biotech Horizon Therapeutics (HZNP). The deal has been allowed to go through and will close later this year. Similarly, the agency challenged Microsoft's (MSFT) acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), only to ultimately back down.But Khan told the audience in Chicago she continues to learn from industry consolidation, which has taken place over the last several years.The FTC's retrospective data, she said, showed that ""below the radar"" deals — less than $100 million in value — that don't have to be reported to the FTC have contributed to market consolidation. The agency found that major tech companies, for example, closed several hundred such deals.""We have, in certain instances, just seen blind spots. Where we've seen a whole set of deals that are below our radar, that are kind of slowly and incrementally consolidating a market, and then five years in, 10 years in, you have two players, three players that have come to dominate,"" Khan said.That's why in a proposed change in July, the FTC is looking at collecting more data on the lower-value deals. The FTC wants to gather information on past smaller deals in addition to other relevant M&amp;A activity that could better inform the agency about the acquiring company's activity.Taking stock of under-the-radar deals: Lina Khan (Saul Loeb/Pool via REUTERS) (POOL New / reuters)""It's definitely a challenge. It's also something Congress is looking at in terms of potential legislation,"" Khan said.Story continuesShe noted that in healthcare in particular, the consolidation of hospitals and provider groups has not shown any benefit in price and competition for patients.""We think that some of the consolidation that we've seen across the board has had very negative effects. We've seen increased prices without any resulting improvements in quality or efficiency,"" Khan said.She wants to avoid the mistakes of the past, when the FTC took a more hands-off approach to activity in the early 2000s, when it assumed the market would self-correct.""Two decades on, we're realizing that wasn't just wrong but in some cases it was the opposite. Because of these network effects and these economies of scale, markets can be much more quick to tip, and that actually requires government to be more vigilant and ensure that in layers where you can envision competition, that we're actually acting vigorously to protect it,"" Khan said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices.]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the materials sector, you can go to the 5 Best Materials ETFs.The global economy heavily relies on basic materials like chemicals, concrete, and metals. Base industrial metals like aluminum, copper, and iron ore are integral for appliances, buildings, equipment, and other infrastructure projects. In addition to these traditional materials, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of metals like lithium in the context of reducing carbon emissions and moving toward renewable energy sources. For instance, the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the demand for specific metals. An average electric car uses 53.2 kilograms of copper as opposed to 22.3 kilograms used in a conventional car. Furthermore, an electric car uses 39.9 kilograms of nickel, 8.9 kilograms of lithium, and 13.3 kilograms of cobalt, all of which are not used in a conventional car.As the transition towards renewable energy is gaining pace with every passing day, leading management consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company believes that materials companies will be required to increase the pace of mining from historical levels for several materials. This could only be ensured by increasing investments in mining, refining, and smelting to roughly $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of this decade. This would reflect a 50% increase from the previous decade. Furthermore, there will be an additional demand of 300,000 to 600,000 mining professionals to support these expanded operations. China is also working aggressively to increase the total output of its material sectors. The country is aiming to achieve a total output of $1.38 trillion (10 trillion yuan) by 2025 from $962.3 billion (7 trillion yuan) in 2021.Investment Options in the Materials SectorWhile basic materials have various industrial uses, they also serve as significant investments due to their qualities as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Inflation in the US is again on the upward trend as the US consumer prices grew by 3.7% YoY in August 2023. This marks the second consecutive month of growth in the consumer price index (CPI) following 12 consecutive months of decline. It must be noted that annual inflation in the US averaged 2.1% between 2000 and 2020. Under these circumstances, investors are looking at basic materials and commodities as a strong hedge against increasing price levels. Throughout history, basic materials, including agricultural goods, commodities, and metals, have shown an upward price trend during periods of high inflation.Story continuesInvestors can consider investing in the best basic materials stocks such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) or the best materials ETFs to gain exposure to the sector. According to our research, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLB) is the oldest ETF in the materials sector.

In addition, there are three other ETFs worth mentioning for their notable presence in the materials sector despite not making it onto our list based on their five-year price performance.The first ETF is the Fidelity MSCI Materials Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FMAT), which was launched in October 2013. Over the last five years, the ETF has generated a return of 32.8%. It has a negligible expense ratio of 0.08% only. The second ETF is the Vanguard Materials Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VAW). The materials ETF by Vanguard tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Materials 25/50 Index. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, which is typical for Vanguard Index funds. Over the past five years, the fund has generated a return of 32.7%. The third ETF that requires special mention is the iShares Global Materials ETF (NYSEARCA:MXI), which tracks the S&amp;P Global 1200 Materials Index. The ETF has experienced an increase of 21.6% in the last five years.10 Best Materials ETFsOur MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 10 best materials ETFs for 2023 based on their 5-year performance. Some of the ETFs included in the list provide broad exposure across the sector, while some are focused on a sub-industry within the materials sector.

The top five ETFs on our list have even outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index based on their five-year performance.

(NYSE:WPM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Precious Metals Royalty basket (Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), SSL, TFPM): In the current macroeconomic environment, there are many ways to ‘win’ with gold. It is remarkable that even with record positive real yields, gold is flirting with all time highs. Why? Western central banks are increasing interest rates which means that they will have to pay more interest on the record levels of debt that their government’s owe. Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this! We believe that precious metals will protect real purchasing power and act as a hedge to the portfolio when macroeconomic uncertainty arises. Owning royalty companies at reasonable valuations gives us a high quality exposure to precious metals without project or cost inflation risks inherent in a mining company.”9.

The thesis is simple…we haven’t developed enough energy or commodity resources to satisfy the near- and medium term needs of the world as well as provide for a renewable/less-carbon intensive future.CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) is an American energy company focused on the coal sector. The business has undergone a shift from being a majority producer of coal for domestic energy purposes to an export-driven producer of coal for non-power generation purposes. Over the last few years, the Company has delevered to a near-zero net debt position and is trading at a 25-30% unlevered free cash flow. While there is a negative stigma associated with coal (and some deserved) there are parts of the world that have limited energy alternatives and will require coal supply over the coming years. I expect the company to commit a large amount of the free cashflow to buying in cheap stock and the per share intrinsic value to grow substantially over the next 3 years.”In addition to investing in the best materials ETFs, investors can also consider investing in stocks such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Other retailers like Macy's (M) and Target (TGT) will also be expanding their holiday workforce. Despite inflation, Wall Street analysts are anticipating a return to more typical consumer spending patterns this year.Yahoo Finance's Josh Scahfer, Brooke DiPalma, and Pras Subramanian discuss various factors employers will be considering this season, including wage increases, labor unionization, and the challenges related to both recruiting and retaining employees.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys. My story today is Amazon. I have my eyes on Amazon after they announced how many workers they're planning to hire for the holiday season. So Amazon coming out and saying they plan to hire 250,000 workers, 30 of those seasonal in just California alone. That's up 67% from what they've hired in years past. So obviously, Amazon expecting a big holiday season here. Target also out saying that they expect to hire 100,000 employees. Macy's saying it will hire 38,000 more employees.Obviously, the holiday season just such a big time for these retailers. And it seems, though, the picture is a little bit mixed on what people expect for holiday sales but not necessarily at a company like Amazon. I think Amazon has solidified themselves for the holiday season. No matter what, they're going to get some demand.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. There's lots of takes from Wall Street and whether or not we're going to see an increase in consumer spending or rather a decrease. And one expert that I spoke to said, we'll see a normalization returning to pre-pandemic levels after we saw such an uptick in sales last year, largely due to inflation. That caused those sales to rise.But in addition to that, as you can see here, these companies are largely bulking up. We heard from Target today that they plan to hire this holiday season. Amazon also ramping up its hiring this holiday season. But definitely a mixed picture on how much exactly consumers are going to spend, given all these headwinds that they're up against.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I'm kind of surprised the sheer kind of numbers, right? Is it 100,000 more workers this year compared to last year? Which is sort of a crazy amount. Expecting fewer shoppers or fewer online shopping to happen, but still it's still a big year, adding boosting wages, which is good to see.And I think is it sort of addressing the need that they want-- they need more workers, or is it there's been some unionization efforts at their warehouses, and this is sort of trying to say, OK, we'll give you guys a little bit here, just don't go crazy with the unionization at our warehouses because that's a problem for them?JOSH SCHAFER: The boosting wages is interesting, too, right, to try and get people that are these seasonal workers. Like, how do you win that worker? I feel like we're still talking about this economy-wide right now, with the worker being someone that is still kind of feeling things out and is high in demand for the amount of job openings that we have. You do have to bump up that pay if you are Amazon.And we were talking about yesterday about Meta. Part of that story with Meta, right, is that they want to retain employees. That's why some of the benefits are coming back. You're seeing companies realizing we probably do need to boost wages or we need to give these workers something, especially if they're going to be seasonal workers, right?If they're only coming in for a short period of time, you've got to find a way to win them over compared to someone like Target.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: That's probably the same kind of worker--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Signing bonus, too.BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. And something that I've been covering a lot is Walmart sort of now having this power over that potential worker, whereas we used to see it vice versa, that worker having that ability choosing where they want to go. But now Walmart sort of backtracking entry level positions that now, ultimately, be all the same pay. They say it's for more opportunity.Others, experts out there saying that they now have power over how much exactly they could pay, and that maybe they could pull back a little bit on how much they're willing to pay and still get that opportunity. But we're seeing Target, Walmart, as well as Amazon ultimately start the holiday shopping season even earlier with tons of deals out in October, which is wild.]"

Forecasters expect holiday sales to come in at half of last year's rate due to concerns about higher prices.Seasonal hiring is expected to drop to its lowest since 2008, according to researcher Challenger, Gray and Christmas, due to higher costs and weak consumer confidence.Target on Tuesday said it would hire 100,000 employees for the holiday shopping season, flat year over year. Target also plans to begin offering discounts in October.Macy's said it would hire more than 38,000 full and part-time workers for the upcoming holiday season, a decline from the previous year.U.S. retail giant Walmart has not yet announced holiday hiring plans. However, it hired 40,000 seasonal workers in 2022.Amazon's boost in hiring comes after it added 50 new fulfillment centers, delivery stations and same-day delivery in the United States, and as it prepares for its expanded fall Prime Event, scheduled for Oct. 10-11.During Amazon's Prime Event, the e-commerce giant is encouraging its merchants to offer discounts, a strategy that could prompt some frugal shoppers to open their wallets and splurge on gifts well ahead of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping days.Amazon's seasonal hiring includes full-time, part-time and seasonal fulfillment employees, it said.New seasonal workers hired to pick, sort, pack and ship orders will get a sign-on bonuses between $1,000 and $3,000 in select locations, compared to associates who received $3,000 bonuses in 2022 and 2021 in some locations, it said.Story continuesAmazon said it will pay its seasonal workers $17 to $28 per hour on average depending on their jobs and locations, compared to the $19 hourly wage workers were offered last year.The Seattle-based e-retailer said it will invest $1.3 billion for pay increases for fulfillment and transportation workers this year.""A fulfillment or transportation employee who starts with us today will see a 13% increase in pay over the next three years —likely more, including our annual wage investments,"" John Felton, Amazon senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement.Amazon earlier this year laid off 27,000 staffers, or about 9% of its workforce, in its advertising, cloud computing and human resources departments following a string of tech lay offs.

Last year, holiday sales jumped 7.6%; in 2019, holiday sales were up 3.4%.""It's a bit of a return to a more normal environment because we have a more normal inflation environment,"" Mastercard Economics Institute US chief economist Michelle Meyer told Yahoo Finance. ""And even though we're not totally back to normal, ... inflation is still elevated for a number of categories. ... It's just much more contained than it was this time last year.""Holiday shoppers make their way past Macy's during Black Friday on November 25, 2022, in New York City. (Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress) (VIEW press via Getty Images)Consumers brace for economic 'adjustment'The consumer is coming into the holiday season feeling the drag of high interest rates, rising gas prices, and student loan repayments, among other headwinds.Gas prices are hurting consumers' wallets again. On Monday, the national average for gasoline in the US reached $3.88 per gallon, according to AAA. That's a 2023 high, as Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reported, though it's lower than prices in 2022 when gas was well over $4 a gallon.""We have to keep a close eye on prices at the pump,"" Meyer said. Although gas prices are not a major concern yet, Meyer added, they often have a direct impact on how Americans perceive their spending power and how they feel about the economy.Other headwinds like households' debt service and student loan payments are also on Meyer's radar.Student loans returning will be ""an adjustment for the economy but not a sudden or abrupt change in the economy,"" Meyer said.And when it comes to the impact of higher interest rates, households' balance sheets are slightly less favorable than those of last year’s holiday shoppers, according to the report.Story continuesLast month, several retailers, including Macy's (M), warned that consumers were having a harder time paying off their credit card balances.Read more: How a Fed interest rate hike impacts credit cardsHowever, Meyer said when it comes to the debt service ratio, which measures debt payments as a percent of disposable income, US consumers are ""basically back to where we were in 2019.""""It's not above despite a higher rate environment, so I think households are managing it very well,"" she said.Where will Americans be spending?Some pandemic-era shopping habits have stuck around.

In August, the cost of groceries ticked up 3% year over year while restaurant prices went up 6.5%.And as we saw this year with the economic boom from Taylor Swift and Beyoncé tours, Americans seem willing to spend on experiences this holiday.""It was pretty amazing ... the extent to which people were willing and able to spend for a lot of these experiences,"" Meyer said.

As the festive season draws near, Macy's is gearing up to cater to the heightened shopping frenzy by bringing on board more than 38,000 full and part-time seasonal associates across its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, along with its distribution centers.The significance of the holiday season for retailers cannot be overstated. This period marks a crucial juncture, often accounting for a substantial portion of annual sales. The influx of enthusiastic shoppers provides retailers with the opportunity to showcase their offerings, boost revenues and solidify brand loyalty. Retailers leverage this period to not only maximize sales but also leave an indelible impression on consumers.To cater to prospective candidates, Macy's offers a streamlined online application process, which takes as little as five minutes, with most job offers extended within 48 hours. In addition, the company is hosting nationwide in-person holiday hiring events on Sep 21 and Oct 19, providing convenient opportunities for potential hires.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne of the standout features of Macy's hiring initiative is its commitment to competitive compensation. Many positions start at a minimum of $15 per hour, ensuring that seasonal workers are fairly rewarded for their efforts. Furthermore, employees can enjoy instant access to earned wages and flexible scheduling options that accommodate their availability.Macy's also values its employees' contributions and offers merchandise discounts as well as enticing referral bonuses of up to $500 for every successful recruit. With various incentive programs in place, colleagues have the chance to earn additional income during the holiday season.Wrapping UpMacy's strategic move to bolster its workforce for the upcoming holiday season not only ensures smooth operations but also underscores the pivotal role this period plays in the retail landscape.However, market analysts are skeptical about whether the upcoming holiday season will meet retailers' expectations.

The company's shares had a relatively subdued couple of weeks in terms of changes in share price, which continued to float around the range of US$211 to US$227. However, is this the true valuation level of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Dynamics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics What Is General Dynamics Worth?Great news for investors – General Dynamics is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 18.15x is currently well-below the industry average of 25.95x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, General Dynamics’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move closer to its industry peers, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from General Dynamics?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 33% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for General Dynamics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price.

If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD.

The contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Majority of the work related to this contract will be executed in Groton, CT. The contract is expected to get completed by September 2028.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Changes in military dynamics have led to increasing defense spending as a well-funded military can deter sudden assault by other nations. This has led to increasing spending on submarines in order to improvise and upgrade sea warfare capabilities. Looking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during 2023-2028.In this context, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics’ Electric Boat unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. Electric Boat is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia class ballistic-missile submarines.The Navy procures Virginia-class submarines in multi-boat blocks at a two-per-year rate. The company is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032.Notably, nine of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section, which adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.Such expertise in manufacturing submarines, which excel in providing unique capabilities to support special missions, must have led to a steady order inflow of submarines for General Dynamics like the latest one, thus boosting its revenue generation prospects.Story continuesPeer MovesDefence majors that are likely to gain from the expanding submarine market are BAE SystemsBAESY, Northrop GrummanNOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the US pet industry and emerging trends, you can directly go to the 5 Best Dog Breeds for Children and Families. Dogs are the most commonly owned pet in the US, with more than 65.1 million homes having at least one. As of 2022, this makes up almost 44.5% of all US households, which is a significant chunk when it comes to other kinds of pets. As the number of homes with pets increases, so does the pet ownership cost. According to a Forbes survey, dog owners spend an average of $730 on their dogs, almost half of which goes to veterinary care. If a dog develops sudden illnesses, the veterinary bills can be racked up to $1,000 and even more in some cases. Such unexpected costs lead to people demanding dog breeds that are not highly prone to developing medical issues, which is one of the critical factors that go into determining the best dog breeds for children and families. However, the advancing trend of having household pets has also led to the creation of multiple jobs in the pet industry, many of which can be acquired by the younger generation, such as dog-sitting. Grand View Research estimated the global pet-sitting market to be at $1.94 billion in 2021 and and forecasted it to grow with a CAGR of almost 11% until 2030. These numbers showcase significant potential for employment in this market, which does not require specialized studies or degrees, making it much more accessible to everyone. Moreover, as per Bureau of Labor Statistics,  overall employment in the animal care industry is expected to grow 16% from 2022 to 2032, with 79,900 job openings being projected for every year in the decade. According to Bloomberg, the overall pet industry is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2030, significantly boosted by higher spending on pet-related healthcare and premium pet food. Considering a market so conducive to growth, many pet-related corporations in the US have witnessed significant milestones in the previous years. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) is a Fortune 500 company that develops healthcare technologies for pets and other livestock animals. The company generated a revenue of $8.1 billion in 2022, showcasing the considerable revenue margin of pet healthcare. Story continuesThe pet pharmaceutical market, as a whole, has the potential to reach $25 billion by 2030 as demands for pet healthcare improvements increase. Even for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), top company executives have confirmed their faith in the financial health of the company. The corporation generated a 6% revenue increase in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to the second quarter of 2022. Companies like Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) are singlehandedly making significant contributions to the pet market in the US, making the lives of companion animals like dogs and, by proxy, their owners a lot easier. Another pet-related market that is showcasing significant growth is the pet food industry. As people continue to invest in high-quality, specialized food for their pets, the pet food market is expected to grow to $135 billion by the end of the current decade. This is where corporations like Chewy Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) are making a massive name for themselves by establishing a diverse pet-related product portfolio, which includes everything from food to pet grooming supplies. The company generated net sales of $10.1 billion in the year 2022. Chewy Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) has made pet healthcare the main focus of its product sales, hoping to generate most of its revenue from this segment of its product line. Companies like Chewy Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) and Petsmart, Inc. are also performing well as the younger generation continues to show a high consumer trend for investing in pet goods. Other market trends include a growth in the number of individuals acquiring pet insurance for their dogs. Part of this is due to the fear of rising veterinary costs and the increasing responsibility that individuals now feel towards their pets. According to Forbes, the average monthly cost of pet insurance for dogs is $56, with higher premiums for bigger breeds like golden retrievers compared to smaller mixed breeds like chihuahuas. From 2020 to 2022, annual veterinary costs for dog households increased by a whopping 60%, leading to a need for companies like Trupanion Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP), which sells insurance policies for cats and dogs. The company had a total of 1,537,573 enrolled pets by the end of 2022, a 31% increase from 2021. Trupanion Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP) is keeping up with the emerging trends in the market, having integrated AI into its insurance invoice system. This has enabled Trupanion Inc. (NASDAQ:TRUP) to become the pet insurance company with the highest degree of veterinary invoice automation in North America. Owing to these changing trends in the pet market of the US, people are now wondering more than ever what would be the best dog breeds for children and families. With a ton of options now available in the market, it’s productive to consider which breeds would result in the least possible liabilities for the family, along with being suitable for little children. 25 Best Dog Breeds for Children and FamiliesPhoto by Cristian Castillo on UnsplashOur Methodology In order to create a list of the best dog breeds for children and families, we resorted to acquiring consumer consensus. We considered people’s opinions on the American site Reddit, where upvotes and the number of mentions were used to rank this list. Based on information from users on the website, here is a list of the 25 best dog breeds for children and families: 25. Portuguese Water DogScore: 01Portuguese water dogs are excellent around children and other pets in the family. They don’t shed as much as certain other breeds, so they’re often considered hypoallergenic, which makes them a great option for a home with kids. They’re also highly trainable and showcase great intelligence and empathy. If purchased from a reputable breeder, a Portuguese water dog may cost somewhere around the range of $3,000 to $3,700. 24. English Cocker Spaniel Score: 02The general nature of the English cocker spaniel is described as easy-going, gentle, and lively. They tend to portray non-aggressive temperaments, making them suitable family pets. The only point of caution would be to note that the massive popularity of the breed has often led to overbreeding, which may result in high-strung puppies or dogs with multiple health issues. In terms of obedience training and housebreaking, cocker spaniels generally rank average.23. English Springer SpanielScore: 03Springer spaniels generally have a fun-loving nature, which makes them excellent playmates for the whole family. This breed needs a fair amount of training and daily exercise to stay out of mischief, but if properly managed, they make extremely friendly pets. These dogs cannot be left alone for more extended periods as they thrive best in company, which is a point to note for working individuals who may need to leave their apartment empty for long hours of the day. 22. Chihuahua Score: 04 Chihuahuas are one of the smaller dog breeds on this list, which works great with families. This dog needs to be well-socialized as they can quickly become quite protective of their owners. The training for this breed should begin as early as four months, and owners should be aware that certain things might take a little time for them to get around to as they do many things at their own pace. Chihuahuas might not be the best option for families with younger kids, but older kids can really appreciate them. 21. Rat TerriersScore: 05The rat terrier was originally bred to be a hunting dog, which may lead to many thinking that they may not be suitable as family pets; however, that’s not true. Rat terriers are exceptionally great with children and older people, making wonderful companion animals. Their hunting nature and origin do require a good amount of focus on training them, but this breed performs great as part of a human family. Traits like these make the rat terriers one of the best dog breeds for children and families. 20. Australian Shepherd Score: 06Australian shepherds are medium-sized dogs that work great with families but are most suitable for experienced dog owners. This breed also works well in other roles, such as herding dogs or police animals. This showcases the diversity and intelligence of the breed, along with the reliance that can be expected from them. The American Kennel Club recognized the Australian Shepherd as an official breed in 1991. 19. Cairn TerrierScore: 07Cairn terriers are among the top smal dog breeds for kids and families on this list. Puppies can range from $1,200 to $2,000 in price. Fully grown dogs in this breed should not weigh more than 13-14 pounds, which are measures to look out for in order to prevent costly health issues. Cairn terriers showcase a lot of loyalty for their owners and also exhibit elements of independent thinking. The breed is sturdy, with a wiry coat that requires care. 18. Boston Terrier Score: 08Boston terriers exhibit high amounts of energy. These dogs will want to participate in everything the family does, making them great pets for those looking for active companions. This breed bodes particularly well in urban settings. While the Boston terrier requires regular exercise in order to manage its energy effectively, their airways are structured in a way that excessive exercise may lead to breathing issues. Hence, these pets are only suitable for individuals who have the time to look out for issues like these. 17. Mongrels Score: 09Mongrels, also known as mutts or mixed-breed dogs, are particularly well-known for their exceptional health. This breed has a relatively stronger immunity than some of the other best dog breeds for children and families, making them less prone to common health issues. Mongrels might not be suitable for individuals looking for their dogs to accomplish a specific purpose because that factor can only be achieved with purebred dogs. 16. Bernese Mountain DogScore: 10Bernese mountain dogs can get along well with other pets in the home if they’re socialized early on. The breed is a quick learner, enabling them to pick up on training quite quickly. These dogs have also been used as watchdogs and livestock guardians owing to their large sizes, but they can be pretty affectionate in family settings. This pet’s loyalty makes it one of the best dog breeds for children and families. 15. Poodle Score: 11The poodle comes in three sizes, two of which make it to this list, showing the breed's popularity in the US. The breed is regarded as one of the most intelligent in the dog family, making poodles highly trainable. They are also exceptionally known for their appearance in dog shows nationwide, which also comes from the ease and convenience of training this breed. 14. WhippetScore: 12Whippets are considered by many to be natural family pets due to their affectionate nature with children and other dog breeds. A pertinent thing to know about this breed is that they require moments of peace, so an all-time noisy household will not turn out to be the best environment for a whippet. The breed is generally healthy, easy to train, and intelligent. 13. Newfoundland Score: 13Newfoundland is among the best big dog breeds for children and families, but due to its moderate energy levels, the dog does not require extensive exercise. They generally possess sweet tempers, with a particular affiliation towards younger children. Due to their webbed feet and natural instincts, Newfies make incredible swimmers, especially good at rescuing people from the water if need be. While the breed possesses a high tolerance for children, their large fur can often knock off toddlers, so it’s best to keep an eye around. 12. BeaglesScore: 14 Beagles are one of the best dog breeds for children and families, but there are both pros and cons to be considered. The breed tends to be relatively low-maintenance, especially in terms of associated costs, but these dogs can also be stubborn. Raising a puppy in this breed requires a generous amount of attention and training, so getting one at the same time as having toddlers might not be the best idea. However, young adults tend to be an excellent option for children. 11. Mini SchnauzerScore: 15The best factor about the mini schnauzer is that it is petite enough to be well-accommodated within an apartment and active enough to become a watchdog for large areas. This makes them a great pet option for a versatile range of owners having significantly different life choices from each other. The breed can be tough and fearless without the added temperament of being aggressive. 10. Cavalier King Charles SpanielScore: 16Multiple spaniel breeds can be considered in the list of the best dog breeds for children and families, which is a testimony to their suitability as family pets. The King Charles Spaniel, in particular, is known for its great appreciation of the outdoors, where it loves spending time with its human family. 9. Rough CollieScore: 17Rough collies are considered a wonderful pet option for families and individuals who live by themselves. The breed showcases very high levels of affection and loyalty, along with being quite intelligent. Rough collies also have a wonderfully adaptive personality, enabling them to adjust to various environments. However, some individuals hesitate from this breed due to its fur; for them, the smooth collie is a much more suitable option that offers similar personality traits. 8. Basset HoundScore: 18Basset hounds are one of the more low-maintenance pets on this list of the best dog breeds for children and families. The dog is quite energetic and comes with a good amount of stamina, but requires only moderate exercise to manage it all. Basset hounds are also highly tolerant of noise and chaotic activity, making them good additions to families with highly active kids. 7. Mini Poodle Score: 19 Mini poodles require much less space and outdoor exposure as compared to their standard counterparts, making them more popular with individuals who value these elements. They can generate strong bonds with their human families, making them wonderful as companion animals. This breed is especially excellent in training and tends to pick up quickly. 6. BichonScore: 20The bichon frise was initially bred as a performance dog for circuses, but over the years, they have garnered a reputation as one of the best dog breeds for children and families. They enjoy playing with children and being a part of their games, which has led to them being known for their liveliness and cheerfulness. This breed can also adjust to diverse environments, making them quite versatile.Click to continue reading and find the 5 Best Dog Breeds for Children and Families.Suggested Articles:Best Dog Foods for Puppies and Small Dogs20 Most Popular Pets In The US20 Most Profitable Pets to Breed and SellDisclosure: None. 25 Best Dog Breeds for Children and Families is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy What Is NextEra Energy's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 NextEra Energy had debt of US$72.2b, up from US$63.6b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.58b, its net debt is less, at about US$70.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is NextEra Energy's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that NextEra Energy had liabilities of US$24.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$89.0b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.58b in cash and US$4.92b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$107.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$138.1b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on NextEra Energy's use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).NextEra Energy has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.9 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.9 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. Notably, NextEra Energy's EBIT launched higher than Elon Musk, gaining a whopping 332% on last year. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NextEra Energy's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, NextEra Energy saw substantial negative free cash flow, in total. While that may be a result of expenditure for growth, it does make the debt far more risky.Our ViewNextEra Energy's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow and net debt to EBITDA definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But the good news is it seems to be able to grow its EBIT with ease. We should also note that Electric Utilities industry companies like NextEra Energy commonly do use debt without problems. When we consider all the factors discussed, it seems to us that NextEra Energy is taking some risks with its use of debt. While that debt can boost returns, we think the company has enough leverage now. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  NextEra Energy is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning...If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is involved in supplying and transporting electricity and natural gas to customers in the northern and central regions of California, USA. On August 7, UBS analyst Gregg Orrill raised PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target, up from $19, noting that lower wildfire threats and constructive California regulations lend the company an optimistic outlook. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is one of the best recession stocks to buy.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 51 hedge funds were bullish on PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), one down from the previous quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the top stakeholder of the firm with 54 million shares worth over $933 million.Third Point Management made the following comment about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our strategy is to preserve liquidity and buying power to take advantage of markets when they “break”. While overall indices remain elevated, we are finding more chances to provide liquidity across all three asset classes in which we invest – credit, structured credit, and equity – opportunities which have been key drivers of performance for the fund. Our portfolio is balanced across industries with a focus on event-driven names including companies involved in spin-offs, significant cost-cutting, or other types of under-appreciated business transformation. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), which is still our largest position, continues to deliver strong performance, down 50bps in the first quarter but up 6.2% for the year to date after the Fire Victims Trust sold another 60 million shares in a block trade.”8. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

The revenue of $4.07 billion increased 10.9% year-over-year, also topping market consensus by $60 million. During recessionary periods, the auto repair market becomes quite costly, causing most people to do minor fixes themselves. This usually leads to an increase in sales for automotive parts and tools, making O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) one of the best recession stocks to invest in.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), same as the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the top stakeholder of the firm with 1.11 million shares worth approximately $1.06 billion.The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) – ORLY outperformed during Q2 led by share gains in its Pro business. Despite macro uncertainties, demand remains strong as customers are prioritizing the repair and maintenance of vehicles. ORLY remains the gold standard for service, part availability, and logistics in this industry. ORLY has a strong balance sheet, and has a good record of effective share repurchase.Reduced: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) – Reduced ORLY twice during Q2, reflecting strong recent performance that resulted in a relatively high valuation. ORLY remains well positioned for growth and leads the auto parts industry, which is fairly insulated from economic turbulence.”7. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a tobacco enterprise striving to create a smoke-free future by developing a long-term product lineup that extends beyond the realm of tobacco and nicotine.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead. Furthermore, at current trading levels, we think the company’s operating leverage, pricing power, and free cash flow profile offer a margin of safety.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power, from sources like wind, solar, nuclear, coal, and natural gas, to both individual consumers and businesses in North America.

The new Platts Emissions-Adjusted (EA) RECs are aimed at shedding light on this additional energy-transition-critical information and providing benchmark values for renewables based on their emissions impact.Platts will use REsurety's high granularity emissions impact data, Locational Marginal Emissions (LMEs), to measure the hourly carbon emissions impact associated with the hourly generation of RECs from individual renewable power plants in the United States, beginning with Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Platts will aggregate and publish a new suite of Emissions-Adjusted REC assessments to provide benchmark prices based on their emissions impact.""By incorporating carbon intensity into REC pricing, we believe the marketplace will welcome this better understanding of the emissions impact of individual certificates,"" said Alan Hayes, Global Head of Energy Transition Pricing, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""By adjusting renewable energy certificates prices to reflect carbon intensity, market participants will be empowered to differentiate and maximize the impact of REC purchases on emissions.""Renewable energy certificates and related instruments worldwide have become a key tool for energy users to direct investment to solar, wind, hydro and other renewable generation technologies. Typically, RECs are traded and priced in US dollars per megawatt hour of power produced. But the emissions impact of each REC varies widely depending on power market fundamentals. At times and locations where production is primarily from fossil-fueled power plants, the carbon emissions impact of clean generation is typically high. At times and locations where renewable generation dominates, the emissions impact of clean generation is typically low. This is not directly reflected in the REC instrument or prices. The collaboration between Platts and REsurety will bring needed clarity and independent valuations to differing power stacks.Story continues""REsurety is excited to collaborate with S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights to address the emissions information gap that is crucial for clean energy buyers who are purchasing RECs to meet their sustainability goals. Publishing the emissions impact of each REC instrument will drive demand to the highest impact projects and locations - which is critical to accelerating our path to a carbon-free grid,"" said Lee Taylor, CEO at REsurety.While the first set of Platts Emissions-Adjusted REC price assessments will relate to Texas power, across coming months, Platts will publish a full suite of Emissions-Adjusted REC prices and carbon intensity (CI) adjustment factors for each of the US power independent system operators.METHODOLOGYPlatts will publish Emission-Adjusted REC prices (USD/MT CO2e) alongside existing REC prices; EA REC prices will be calculated by dividing the REC price (USD/MWh) of a given REC certificate by the emissions impact of that same REC certificate (kgCO2e/MWh) over the period. EA REC prices will be published for the prior year and on a year-to-date basis for the current year.

TSN has been dedicated to achieving sustainable top-line growth and margin enhancement in the long term. Alongside its leadership team, the company is actively implementing a comprehensive strategy centered on efficiency and modernization, which involves a thorough examination of the cost structure throughout the organization to foster operational excellence.TSN declared its plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to close four additional chicken facilities, bringing the total number of closures announced this year to six, showcasing its steadfast commitment to undertaking significant actions aimed at enhanced performance.Tyson Foods is actively implementing various operational and supply-chain efficiency programs to position itself better for the near future. These initiatives include investments in digitalization and automation technology to accelerate its supply-chain planning and execution processes for enhanced customer service.The company has also been focused on improving its ability to forecast supply and demand more accurately, meeting the needs of customers and consumers. To this end, it recently chose to shift its approach for Tyson-branded chicken from ""no antibiotics ever"" to one that focuses on antibiotics essential for human medicine. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Will Saving Initiatives Ease Margin Pressure?In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Tyson Foods experienced significant margin pressure, with its gross profit totaling $677 million, a notable decrease from the $1,611 million reported in the same period of the previous year. This decline resulted in the gross profit margin falling to 5.2%, down from 11.9% in the year-ago quarter.One of the primary factors contributing to this margin pressure was the escalation of input costs per pound. The increase in cattle costs, coupled with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor expenses, played a significant role in driving these elevated input costs.However, TSN is committed to improving its cost structure for productivity savings. In fiscal 2022, a productivity program was launched and resulted in more than $700 million in productivity savings. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company had already surpassed its $1-billion aggregate target, more than a year ahead of schedule.Story continuesWrapping UpProtein demand has been driving Tyson Foods. For fiscal 2023, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) forecasts a slight increase in domestic protein production (including beef, pork, chicken and turkey) from that reported in fiscal 2022.Management's sales projection for fiscal 2023 is pegged at $53-$54 billion. The company anticipates improved performance from its foreign operations within the International/Other segment for the fiscal year.Per USDA forecasts, the production in the Chicken segment is likely to improve 3% in fiscal 2023. However, in the Beef segment, USDA predicts a 3% year-over-year decline in domestic production. Domestic production is expected to be relatively stable for Pork in fiscal 2023.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has railed 8.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rise of 0.4%.3 Hot Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely MGP Ingredients, Inc.

Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Synchrony has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Blackstone Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that SYF is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.SYF currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.35, while BX has a forward P/E of 27.47.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Synchrony Financial (SYF). SYF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.20. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.96. SYF's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.56 and as low as 5.05, with a median of 6.48, all within the past year.We also note that SYF holds a PEG ratio of 1.40. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. SYF's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.44. Over the last 12 months, SYF's PEG has been as high as 1.78 and as low as 0.22, with a median of 1.38.Another notable valuation metric for SYF is its P/B ratio of 1.08. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. SYF's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.20. Over the past year, SYF's P/B has been as high as 1.48 and as low as 0.92, with a median of 1.15.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. SYF has a P/S ratio of 0.71. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.6.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Synchrony Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment.

Its balance sheet strength is a major positive. Over the past six months, the stock has jumped 14.3%, outperforming the industry average of 8.2%.Synchrony — with a market cap of $13.6 billion — is a premier consumer financial services company, which offers a wide range of credit products. Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SYF’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $5.05 per share, which improved 1.8% in the past 30 days. The stock has witnessed two upward estimate revisions during this time against none in the opposite direction. Synchrony beat on earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 5.7%. This is depicted in the graph below.Synchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial Price and EPS SurpriseSynchrony Financial price-eps-surprise | Synchrony Financial QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year net interest income stands at $16.9 billion, suggesting an 8% rise from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate indicates a significant increase in interest on credit cards, which is likely to support the top-line growth.The company’s Health &amp; Wellness platform is expected to continue its growth track, thanks to a solid CareCredit brand. SYF’s focus on growing the brand with partnerships and collaborations is noteworthy. It recently made deals with specialty dental practice support services providers, Specialty1 Partners and the University of Missouri, Oregon State University and Virginia Tech for offering pet financing solutions.The Health &amp; Wellness platform witnessed 10.2% year-over-year growth in average active accounts in 2022. Our estimate for 2023 indicates a further increase of more than 10%. We expect loan receivables to witness a nearly 17% jump this year.Story continuesThe company expects total loan receivables to grow by more than 10% in 2023, following a 14.5% increase witnessed last year. It also anticipates interest and fees to grow going ahead and the net interest margin to be within 15-15.15% this year.SYF exited the second quarter with cash and equivalents of $12.7 billion, which increased from $10.3 billion at 2022-end. It has a net debt to capital of 5.5%, lower than the industry average of 5.5%. Its balance sheet health supports the shareholder value boosting measures.In the June quarter alone, it returned capital worth $399 million through share repurchases of $300 million and paid common stock dividends of $99 million. It had a remaining share buyback capacity of $1 billion at the end of June 2023. Its dividend yield of 3.1% compares favorably with the industry average of 2.3%.Key RisksHowever, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on.Although the continuous high interest rate environment is helping Synchrony earn increased interest income, it will likely affect consumers’ spending levels. Also, losses are expected to build up on cards, as well as office real estate. Moreover, it expects net charge-offs for 2023 to be in the range of 4.75-4.90%, which suggests a significant increase from the 2022 reported figure of 3%.

222,b2ca9da4-1024-3bdf-88e3-4ac887800ba3,MA,2023-09-20,15 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-performing-currencies-2023-212504095.html,1695072304,STORY,"['JPM', 'MA', 'PYPL']","[In this article, we discuss the 15 worst performing currencies of 2023. If you want to read about some more worst performing currencies, go directly to 5 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023. A rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the United States was expected to push the US dollar, the official currency in the country and the most popular globally, lower this year. However, robust economic data from the US, as well as a slowdown in major economies around the globe, has fueled rebound growth in the US dollar. This growth has also pressured the economics of prominent world powers, like China and Japan, who have been forced to resort to stimulus measures aimed at shoring up their local currencies. Prominent financial stocks in the US like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all jumped in value due to the prevailing economic conditions. Per data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the net short bets on the dollar shrank to $7.17 billion in early September, from $21.28 billion in late July. The July figure was a two-year high. Market experts, like Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign exchange and macro strategist at investment bank UBS, believe the data highlights the strength of the US economy against the rest of the world. The strength of the US dollar can be viewed in context of the challenging economic conditions in China and loose monetary policy in other developing countries. Surging global prices for energy and food are also contributing to this strength in the dollar as other currencies go on a downward spiral. Japanese and Chinese authorities, as well as governments around the world, are stepping up regulations on foreign exchange markets to stop the rut. Edward Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA and a veteran global currency strategist, believes that actions need to follow statements from fiscal chiefs. Per Moya, the markets are not convinced of Japanese attempts to deal with currency rates and that attempts to limit the liquidity of the yuan are likely not to overcome the pressure a weakening economy has placed on the currency. The strength of the US dollar can be measured by the US dollar index, which measures the performance of the USD against a basket of global currencies. In the past four weeks, this index is up by nearly 3%, to the highest levels seen since March. The past week has been especially kind on the index as it registered a jump of nearly 2% in a few days. Story continuesThe strength of the dollar has hit currencies in developing nations. Coupled with rising inflation, inaction on parts of central banks, and trade deficit numbers, several currencies have nose-dived in value over the past few months. Government in these nations, like Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Syria, have all been forced to look to international lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for dollar inflows to stabilize the worsening economic conditions. Whether these bailouts are effective in the face of loose monetary policies is still up for debate.Our MethodologyIn this article, we will list the 15 worst performing currencies of 2023. The ranking is calculated by calculating the percentage decrease in value of the currencies in terms of the US dollar value. The currencies in which the percentage decrease in value in terms of the US dollar are the highest are considered the worst performing. Data for this purpose has been taken from foreign exchange company XE. An initial data set comprising the 50 worst currencies with the highest value against the US dollar on January 2, 2023 was used. The percentage decrease was calculated by comparing this value against the worth of the currency against the US dollar on September 15, 2023. Digital coins were excluded from the list. 15 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023Pixabay/Public DomainWorst Performing Currencies of 202315. Zambian KwachaPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 18 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 20Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 11%The Kwacha is the currency of Zambia, a country in Africa that borders Zimbabwe. The country used the British pound as the legal tender till 1964 before shifting to Kwacha. The Kwacha has taken a hit against the US dollar in recent months as private sector spending contracts, inflation hits record highs, and the central bank of the country raises interest rates to around 10% to combat rising prices. The Zambian currency is subject to uncertainty due to debt restructuring and dwindling copper production. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all warned investors of the unstable economic situation in Zambia. 14. South African RandPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 17 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 19Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 11%South African Rand is the official currency of South Africa. One of the reasons for the bad performance of the Rand this year has been the interest rate hikes in the US that have had a net negative impact on emerging economies. Another important factor has been Chinese influence in the country. China is the biggest trading partner of South Africa and reports of a slowdown in the Chinese economy have hit the currency throughout the year, although fresh stimulus measures from Beijing have provided some monetary relief in recent weeks. 13. Rwandan FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 1070 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 1207Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 12.8%Rwandan Franc is the official currency of Rwanda, a country in Africa that borders Uganda. Stubborn inflation has forced the central bank in the country to raise key interest rates this year, resulting in a downward spiral with regards to the currency. Despite the rate increases, inflation numbers in the country continue to make headlines. In August 2023, the annual inflation rate in Rwanda increased to 17.4%, up from 17.3% in July. 12. Lao KipPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 17279 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 19949Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 15%Lao Kip is the legal tender in Laos, a Southeast Asian country bordered by Myanmar and China. Kip has been the official currency in the country since 1955. A spike in commodity prices and a tightening of global financial conditions have resulted in Kip losing value against the US dollar this year. The proximity to China and the impact of a slowing Chinese economy have also made it harder for the Kip to gain in value. External liquidity pressures, a widening circular debt, and large external debt repayments all continue to haunt the currency. 11. Sierra Leonean LeonePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 18854 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 22457Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 19%Sierra Leonean Leone is the official currency of Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa that borders Guinea. High energy and food prices, partly due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have forced the poor African country to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for loan programs. Foreign exchange reserves of the country are also dwindling, forcing further pressure on the local currency. This situation is expected to continue in the coming months and the country remains at risk of debt distress. 10. Congolese FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 2036 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 2466Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 21%Congolese Franc is the official currency of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The currency has depreciated against the US dollar this year as the government amps up spending to fight the M23 rebel group. Salary arrears payments and rising inflation have contributed to this decline as well. The economy of the country is reliant on imports and this has also increased economic instability. Per the World Bank, the country is one of the poorest in the world, with about two-thirds of the population of 100 million living on less than $2.10 a day. 9. Egyptian PoundPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 24 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 30Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 25%The Egyptian Pound is the official currency of Egypt, the 14th-most populated country in the world, and the third-most populated in Africa. The annual urban inflation rates in the country have skyrocketed in recent months, touching 37.4% in August this year, up from 36.5% in the previous month. These figures remain significantly above the target range of the central bank and market expectations. In a country where a disproportionately large number of inhabitants live in urban areas, this inflation, coupled with macro pressures and a shortage of foreign currency, has resulted in a strong depreciation of the currency. 8. Pakistani RupeePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 226 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 296Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 31%Pakistani Rupee is the official currency of Pakistan, a South Asian country that borders India and China. Persistent inflation, an import economy, and a large circular debt crisis are some of the reasons why the Rupee has faced strong headwinds in recent months. A debt restructuring plan by the government, which included going to the IMF for help, has also been on the radar of investors who want to put money into the Pakistani economy. The Rupee has been gaining against the US dollar in recent weeks but it is not clear whether these gains will translate to meaningful stability in the economic domain. 7. Russian RublePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 71 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 96Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 35%Russian Ruble is the official currency of Russia, the largest country in the world that has a huge geopolitical influence on Europe and Asia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine last year forced Western countries to impose tough sanctions on Russian imports. These sanctions even had an impact on top Russian exports such as energy and food, driving up global inflation numbers and contributing to a freefall in the value of the Ruble against the US dollar. These pressures remain intact this year, as Moscow deals with internal rebellions over the war. 6. Burundian FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 2070 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 2832Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 36%Burundian Franc is the official currency of Burundi, a country in Africa that borders Rwanda. Burgeoning government debt, persistent inflation, and rising food prices have all contributed to a decline in the value of the local currency against the US dollar this year. Governmental policies to tackle economic instability, which include the issuing of new 5,000 and 10,000 Burundian franc banknotes, have not been met with the expected reaction, as shortages lead to mass protests and increased economic skepticism. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all warned investors of the unstable economic situation in Burundi.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

We will also discuss the recent trends in the crypto market along with the major players in the industry. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most.Will Bitcoin Grow to an All-Time High by 2024?On September 7, Forbes analyzed what the future holds for Bitcoin. According to the report, Bitcoin has witnessed significant price improvements in 2023. After a rough period for the crypto market in 2022, Bitcoin reported a strong comeback in 2023. In July, Bitcoin climbed to $31,000. While the price for one Bitcoin slightly deteriorated to $25,956 on September 13, experts expect a recovery soon. According to the report, Bitcoin seems to be under inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressures forced the Fed to raise interest rates. Such has contributed to a major resistance in the trade of Bitcoin at the price of $28,900. The report informs readers that, as per the Indian government, all transactions of digital assets would be regulated by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). While crypto laws are necessary, stringent regulations may limit the growth of the cryptocurrency market.Despite the turmoil surrounding the current status of Bitcoin, the reports hint at 2024 being a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin halving event is expected in 2024, which brings the hope of a boost in the price of Bitcoin. The halving event takes place every four years. During the halving event, the price reward to Bitcoin miners is cut by 50%. Such helps contract the supply and is a positive sign for Bitcoin's price.Uncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin have been a common trend this year. Stringent regulations in countries and a worsening global macroeconomic condition limit the ability of experts to predict the future of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, experts hold high expectations for the coming year. Take a look at the most valuable currencies in the world.Story continuesWhat Do the New Crypto Regulations Mean?The United States is home to one of the most crypto owners. However, this does not exclude the American market from the wrath of uncertainty and volatility of currencies. On August 25, Reuters reported new crypto regulations introduced by the Biden administration. According to the new tax reporting rules, crypto brokers must report sales and exchanges of all digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The new tax reporting regulations were primarily aimed at countering tax evasion. On the bright side, the new tax regulation makes processing easier for regular crypto taxpayers. The regulation aligns with the administration's efforts to bring in more money from taxes. With the new bill in action, the estimated tax revenue for the next decade is almost $28 billion. To shed light on the importance of tax regulations for the future of the economy, the treasury reported:""This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.""While regulation is a prerequisite for the mass acceptance of crypto or Bitcoin as a mainstream payment method, stringent laws may limit user's willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the new tax regulations can only be judged in the coming months.Are Large Corporations Withdrawing Interest in Crypto?Are large companies with significant stakes in the crypto market distancing themselves from the crypto industry? Is this because of stringent laws or the falling prices of Bitcoin?On August 25, CNBC reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently ended its partnership with Binance. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) will not offer branded Binance cards in Latin America and the Middle East anymore. Users used these cards to purchase commodities directly with their crypto assets. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) also ended its partnership with Binance in July. Such indicates the growing concerns of holding partnerships with companies currently surrounded by intense regulatory scrutiny.However, this does not mean that companies are withdrawing interest crypto as a mainstream payment method. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) still offer a range of crypto cards, allowing people to make hassle-free payments using their crypto assets.Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) offers prepaid cards funded by Tap, Nexo, and Gemini. The company's efforts in transforming the crypto landscape continue, regardless of the scrutiny around the crypto market. On August 17, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced its new Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Partner Program. To kick-start the program, the company involved a group of leading blockchain providers to join the program. These include Ripple, Consensys, Fluency, Idemia, Consult Hyperion, Giesecke+Devrient, and FireBlocks. The company understands the importance of having a government-mandated public digital currency. Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), spearheading the program, stated:""We believe in payment choice, and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy. As we look toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.""Similarly, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is also making leaps in the crypto market. On September 5, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced it is expanding its stablecoin capabilities. The company will now introduce the USDC stablecoin on the Solana blockchain network. The company has been experimenting with the USDC stablecoin since 2021 and has now integrated the Solana network due to its efficient and speedy systems. Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa, stated:""By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to send or receive funds from Visa's treasury easily. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve how we move money.""Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a leading financial technology and software firm based in the United States. The company formerly began the development of Bitkey, a crypto product. This product is made to store all your digital assets in a physical wallet. The company is making leaps in the industry and reports strong earnings, which reflects that the crypto industry is far from declining. On August 3, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) reported results from the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.39 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 25.67% year over year and amounted to $5.53 billion, ahead of market consensus by $433.36 million. Jack Dorsey, head of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), also discussed the company's plans and important partnerships to boost the integration of cryptocurrencies in the business. He stated:""Earlier this year, we shared plans for the public beta testing of our bitcoin wallet, Bitkey. And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App, to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.""Large corporations investing in the development of crypto is a positive sign for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, crypto-friendly laws are essential to boost crypto ownership and establish crypto as a primary payment method. With that, let's take a look at the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most.20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the MostPhoto by bitcoin executium on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most, we integrated three different metrics. These included the total population from the World Bank, the percentage of the total population that owns cryptocurrencies by Triple A, and the crypto adoption index by Chainanalysis. We considered data as of 2022 for consistency across all our metrics. The crypto adoption index by Chain Analysis is based on five different metrics. These metrics are a combination of the retail value of the cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies at centralized exchanges, and trade volume.We shortlisted the top 50 countries from each of the three data sources. The crypto adoption index and percentage of the total population that owns crypto were given a higher priority. Of the two databases, we chose the first 20 common countries for our list. The figures for the total population were included as reference figures to add credibility to our data.According to our hypothesis, high crypto usage will translate as high bitcoin usage. We have ranked the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most in ascending order.20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most20.

The platform is scheduled to be commercially available by summer 2024.The company's new offerings are designed to enhance the performance of wireless networks for service providers and enterprise customers. Qualcomm's 'Service Defined' Wi-Fi platform is set to provide a unified data flow management architecture, which can adapt to user activities such as gaming, streaming, or video conferencing. This technology is expected to optimize the utilization of newly deployed fiber optic cable and new technology like Wi-Fi 7.The platform will also give service providers tools to improve network performance. Current systems manage network access to the home and Wi-Fi within the home separately, reducing the quality of service across the network. However, with Service Defined, Qualcomm aims to offer service providers unprecedented orchestration and insights that can enhance subscriber experience. It will enable them to offer differentiated services optimized for various uses.In addition to its Service Defined technology, Qualcomm's 10G Fiber Gateway will facilitate 10Gbps connectivity ""to and through the home"" using 10G Passive Optical Network (PON) tech and multi-gigabit Wi-Fi 7.According to Ganesh Swaminathan, VP and GM of Qualcomm's wireless infrastructure and networking business, the new platform will enable service providers to extend service level agreements to the Wi-Fi network and program the gateway to deliver service precisely. This could effectively improve Wi-Fi connection performance in areas such as latency as network conditions change.Qualcomm's new software-based Wi-Fi management platform can run on a range of access networks, including fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), hybrid fiber/coax (HFC)/DOCSIS and fixed wireless access (FWA). Its latest move into the broadband gateway arena is fiber-focused.Story continuesIn addition to these developments, Qualcomm announced a pair of service provider wins. Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) will use Qualcomm technology to deploy Wi-Fi 7 capabilities on new routers available to Charter customers in 2024. Furthermore, EE, a BT Group (LON:BT) brand/unit, has partnered with Qualcomm for future Wi-Fi 7 rollouts on the UK-based operator's new home broadband ""Smart Hub,"" set to debut next year.Qualcomm's move into this market segment will place the company in closer competition with firms such as Airties, DZS, Calix (NYSE:CALX) and Plume. Despite this, Qualcomm plans to use open APIs (application programming interfaces) to build a framework that can integrate with other cloud platforms already in use by service operators.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study QUALCOMM's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:42% = US$8.6b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.42 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 42% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. As a result, QUALCOMM's exceptional 42% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that QUALCOMM's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QCOM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is QUALCOMM Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?QUALCOMM has a three-year median payout ratio of 32% (where it is retaining 68% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like QUALCOMM is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Additionally, QUALCOMM has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 31% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 36%.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Semiconductor Market Share By Company: Top 5.Semiconductor Industry: An OverviewSemiconductors are the prime element powering a multitude of products around us, ranging from automotive to advanced generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has fuelled the demand for semiconductors, which are vital for smart devices and facilitate connectivity. Mckinsey has called semiconductors ""the unsung heroes of the technology world.""The semiconductor market size is growing rapidly. According to a report by Precedence Research, the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $1.88 trillion by 2032 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.28%. The Asia Pacific region is the most dominant semiconductor market and has been estimated to hold this position throughout the forecast period. In 2022, the Asia Pacific semiconductor market was valued at $230.5 billion. The presence of top-notch semiconductor companies in China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan greatly contributed to the region's distinction in the global market. North America and Europe have also been estimated to grow substantially during the forecast period. According to McKinsey, 70% of the future growth of the semiconductor industry would come primarily from three main industries: automotive, computation, and data storage and wireless industry—the automotive industry will account for almost 20% of the market expansion in the coming years. The surge in demand for electric vehicles is expected to also contribute to the semiconductor industry’s growth. Latest Trends And DevelopmentsThe semiconductor industry faced a massive shortage post-pandemic. The pandemic caused a drop in semiconductor demand for the automotive industry while simultaneously causing an upsurge in demand by the tech industry. According to McKinsey, auto sales declined as much as 80% in Europe in the early days of the pandemic, and as more people started working from home, there was a rising need for electronic devices. Story continuesThe automotive industry contracts usually have a shorter term focused on quick delivery of products. As a canon event, the drop in semiconductor demand by the automotive industry led to semiconductor companies signing longer-term contracts with other industries. Post-pandemic, when the automotive industry started recovering, the semiconductor industry was already bound in longer contracts delivering products to other industries. This difference caused a supply-demand imbalance, majorly contributing to the worldwide semiconductor shortage. Semiconductor companies are employing various strategies to combat semiconductor shortages. The companies have started nurturing ecosystem capabilities through collaboration and investments. On September 12, Reuters reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) will be investing almost $100 million in the initial public share offering (IPO) of Arm Holdings Plc. The chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has acknowledged the significance of Arm in the semiconductor ecosystem for both the technology and customers. The company wants Arm to be 'successful' and 'healthy.' Semiconductor companies are also building capacity through collaborations and partnerships. On September 5, Reuters reported that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has partnered with Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM). Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would provide foundry services to the company, which would then provide an investment of $300 million in Intel's New Mexico factory. The equipment to be installed in the New Mexico factory is going to be owned and acquired by Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM). This partnership will help Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) meet the growing demand as it would add 600,000 photo layers per month to its capacity. The companies are very positive about this collaboration, as expressed by the CEO of Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM), who sees this collaboration as the first step in developing many ""unique synergistic solutions"" in the future.Another strategy that could help meet the soaring semiconductor demand while dominating the market is technology advancement by designing and manufacturing the most efficient products. On August 29, Reuters reported that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would launch a new data center chip named ""Sierra Forest"" next year. The chip will have a ""240% better performance per watt"" than the current generation of similar chips. The new data center chip will be more energy-efficient, enabling it to compete with other companies processing data chips like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).Semiconductor companies are also signing longer contracts to gain more stability and certainty of the future. On September 11, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has signed a deal to provide the tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with 5G chips. The deal will last till 2026 and would significantly benefit both companies. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be able to effectively cater to the supply chain challenges while QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) will earn billions of dollars. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had previously signed a deal with the company in 2019.Many semiconductor companies are competing to meet the growing product demand while staying ahead of their competitors. These companies have varying levels of influence in the semiconductor industry.

230,876f3ad6-6e9c-3632-a0aa-84709212db46,QCOM,2023-09-20,Wall Street Analysts Think Qualcomm (QCOM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-qualcomm-133006316.html,1695043806,STORY,['QCOM'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Qualcomm (QCOM).Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.72, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.2% and 4.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Qualcomm, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is QCOM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.31.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article, Top 5 Unfriendliest Cities in the US.One of the biggest factors behind any city turning unfriendly is tourism gone rouge. It's a negative feedback loop. A city begins to attract tourists in droves. That becomes a problem for the locals. Locals naturally become unfriendly and rude to tourists. Tourists label the locals as unfriendly and rude and the city becomes notorious for its unfriendliness. A study published in the European Journal of Tourism Research found that mass tourism can lead to ""overtourism,"" which can have negative consequences for local residents. Overtourism can put a strain on the local community, as residents may feel irritated by the crowds and the noise. It can also lead to an unnecessary reliance on the tourism industry, which can disrupt local labor structures and community roles.Tourism in the United StatesInternational travel plays a critical role in supporting the economy of the US. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign travelers spent over $233.5 billion in the tourism industry. This injected $640 million into the country every day. In January 2023, travel spending in the US amounted to $14.75 billion, up 64% from January 2022. US travel spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by the end of 2023, up from $1.2 trillion in 2022. By 2026, spending is expected to reach $1.26 trillion. Consequently, the airline industry in the US is currently faring well. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), American airline traffic reached an all-time high in May 2023, with over 81.8 million passengers carried, both domestically and internationally. Major airlines like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are currently dominant players in the US airline market. It is one of the 20 best airlines in the world, with a fleet of over 900 aircraft.  Hotel accommodation establishments across the country have been busy this summer. Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR) reported a 10% increase in revenue in the second quarter in the US, driven by higher occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Marriott  (NASDAQ:MAR) plans to open over 35 new luxury hotels in 2023, and expand their portfolio to over 500 properties worldwide.Story continuesCompanies Ensuring Sustainable Tourism in AmericaIn 2023, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), an American travel technology conglomerate, partnered with the UnTours Foundation and TUI Care Foundation to launch a $10 million fund. Through this fund, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) hopes to help scale sustainable tourism businesses. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), a major US airline, is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. The company has been exploring ways to use more sustainable materials, improve fuel efficiency, and offset its carbon emissions. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has started a trial of reusable cups for in-flight drinks, which will reduce their environmental impact and fulfill their commitment to sustainability.Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the USMethodology We defined the ""unfriendliest cities in the US"" as those where foreign travelers have reported having unpleasant experiences with the locals.To collect information, we conducted a systematic search of relevant Reddit threads, where users recounted their experiences with unfriendly locals in specific cities.

The search dominance led to fast-increasing advertising revenues that made Google a $1 trillion company.David Dahlquist, speaking for the government, pointed to a document that was redacted that had a short back and forth about Google's pricing for search advertising.Dahlquist then argued to Judge Amit Mehta, who will decide the case, that information like the tidbit in the documentshould not beredacted. ""This satisfies public interest because it's at the core of the DOJ case against Google,"" he said.Speaking for Google, John Schmidtlein urged that all discussions of pricing be in a closed session, which means the public and reporters must leave the courtroom.It is not unusual in merger trials for information like market share and business and pricing strategies to be redacted.And sometimes the redactions are broader since, essentially, the companies want the information hidden and the government lawyers fighting the merger are working flat out to win rather than worrying about over-sealing, said Katherine Van Dyck, an experienced litigator and senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project.""Litigation is a pretty grueling process,"" she said.Her organization has pushed for the trial to be put onto telephone lines, as pre-trial hearings were because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Mehta denied that motion.Van Dyck believes that Mehta's call was the wrong one.""When you have these cases with massive, broad public interest and public import, the courts need to do a better job of taking that into account, change their rules and keep up with modern technology,"" she said.Story continuesCase in point was testimony given early Monday by a Verizon executive, Brian Higgins, about the company's decision to always pre-install Google's Chrome browser with Google search on its mobile phones.After about 30 minutes of testimony, Higgins' testimony was closed for the next two hours.It's possible that he was asked about Google's payments to Verizon but the public will never know. Those payments - which the government said are $10 billion annually to mobile carriers and others - helped the California-based tech giant win powerful default positions on smartphones and elsewhere.Throughout the trial, Google's defense is that its high market share reflects the quality of its product rather than any illegal actions to build monopolies in some aspects of its business.The antitrust fight could change the future of the internet, now dominated by four giants that have been under scrutiny from Congress and antitrust enforcers since the Trump administration. Companies have defended themselves by emphasizing that their services are free, as in the case of Google, or inexpensive, as in the case of Amazon.com.If Google is found to have broken the law, Judge Mehta, who is deciding the case, will then consider how best to resolve it. He may decide simply to order Google to stop practices he has found to be illegal or he may order Google to sell assets. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Paul Simao and Nick Zieminski)]"

This would show why Google would want to pay to have the default, or exclusive, position to win more search queries and make higher profits advertising on them.In response, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein showed the court data indicating that users happily stick with Google's search engine when pre-installed on their devices but switch away from others they like less.One leg of Google's defense is that its high market share reflects the quality of its product rather than any illegal actions to build monopolies in some aspects of its business.The antitrust fight could change the future of the internet, now dominated by four giants that have been under scrutiny from Congress and antitrust enforcers since the Trump administration.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Lockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lockheed Martin, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 15% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.6% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 17 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$92m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

For the first time since 2018, the index has recorded 100 consecutive sessions without a daily drop of 1.5% or more.While the index has experienced four declines of more than 1% since it peaked earlier this year, daily fluctuations have generally remained subdued, reminiscent of the stability seen in 2018. The S&amp;P 500 index is up 16% so far in 2023. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has risen 16.8% (read: 5 Beaten-Down ETFs to Buy Now).We have highlighted five stocks from different sectors that have gained more than 50% this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These are Nvidia NVDA, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Palo Alto Networks PANW, PulteGroup Inc. PHM and Amazon.com AMZN.What’s Behind the Resilience?The resilience came on the back of optimism that the economy has withstood the worst of the Fed’s policy tightening. The central bank has raised interest rates 11 times to the highest level since 2001 over the course of 16 months.Inflationary pressures are easing, meaning that rate hikes will likely end soon. Though inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, it has dropped from a peak of 9.1%. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace, buoyed by robust consumer spending. Job gains have also been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Notably, the economy has added 278,000 jobs per month so far this year and the unemployment rate of 3.8% is not far from a half-century low.Contributing to the resilience is the continued investor interest in equities. Recent data from LSEG Lipper reveals that U.S. ETFs have garnered a net inflow of $13.4 billion in the week ending Sep 13, marking the ninth increase in the past 12 weeks.However, surging oil price is adding to inflationary pressure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had indicated the possibility of further rate hikes, if needed, to ensure inflation remains under control (read: ETFs to Tap Oil Price Strength).Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $413 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 63 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors.

You should consider the First Trust Large Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF (FTA), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 05/08/2007.The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $1.19 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.59%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.17%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 24.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Pultegroup, Inc. (PHM) accounts for about 1.18% of total assets, followed by D.r. Horton, Inc. (DHI) and Lennar Corporation (LEN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 10.38% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFTA seeks to match the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Value Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ AlphaDEX Large Cap Value Index is an enhanced index which employs the AlphaDEX stock selection methodology to select stocks from the NASDAQ US 500 Large Cap Value Index.The ETF has added about 3.29% so far this year and it's up approximately 9.20% in the last one year (as of 09/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $57.68 and $73.30.The ETF has a beta of 1.13 and standard deviation of 18.32% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 188 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust Large Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FTA is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $50.54 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $101.60 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

249,12663987-6910-355b-87f8-099cfd31cd5a,JNJ,2023-09-20,10 Best Investments During A Recession,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-investments-during-recession-082559142.html,1695111959,STORY,"['UNH', 'ORLY', 'NEE', 'WMT', 'JNJ', 'PCG', 'STZ', 'PM']","[insIn this article, we discuss 10 best investments during a recession. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9.

252,23764613-8bcc-300e-89fe-8e3fde8d7423,MDT,2023-09-20,Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) Stock's On A Decline: Are Poor Fundamentals The Cause?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plc-nyse-mdt-stocks-120114355.html,1695211274,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.4%. To decide if this trend could continue, we decided to look at its weak fundamentals as they shape the long-term market trends. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Medtronic's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:7.1% = US$3.7b ÷ US$51b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 7.1% ROEOn the face of it, Medtronic's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.2% either. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Medtronic over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Medtronic's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 9.3% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDT? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Medtronic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Medtronic has a high three-year median payout ratio of 82% (or a retention ratio of 18%), meaning that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This does go some way in explaining why there's been no growth in its earnings.Moreover, Medtronic has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 50% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 14%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

(Nasdaq: OBIO) (“Orchestra BioMed” or the “Company”), a biomedical company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted approval of an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) to initiate the global pivotal BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) study evaluating the efficacy and safety of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy (also known as BackBeat CNT™) for treating hypertensive patients who are indicated for a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.Orchestra BioMed and Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) formed a strategic collaboration for the development and commercialization of AVIM therapy for hypertensive pacemaker patients in July 2022. Under the collaboration, Medtronic is providing Orchestra BioMed with development, clinical, and regulatory support for the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, which Orchestra BioMed is sponsoring. If approved, Medtronic will have exclusive global rights to commercialize AVIM-enabled pacing systems for this target population. Orchestra BioMed will share in the revenues generated from Medtronic sales of the AVIM-enabled pacing systems.Story continues“We are thrilled to receive IDE approval from the FDA and move forward with plans to initiate the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, which is designed to support potential future regulatory review and potential approval of AVIM therapy for hypertensive patients indicated for a pacemaker. Achieving this milestone a little over a year after starting our strategic collaboration with Medtronic is a significant accomplishment for our company,” said David Hochman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Orchestra BioMed. “We believe this innovative therapy has the potential to substantially improve the standard of care for hypertensive pacemaker patients and we look forward to initiating the study before the end of 2023.”David Kandzari, M.D., Chief of the Piedmont Heart Institute and Chief Scientific Officer for Piedmont Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and Co-Principal Investigator for the BACKBEAT Study, commented: “Hypertension is the world’s leading modifiable risk for death and affects over one billion people worldwide. While existing pharmaceutical treatments can be effective, more than half of individuals with hypertension do not meet blood pressure treatment goals. A device-based treatment like AVIM therapy has the potential to complement existing standards of care and reduce blood pressure to improve clinical outcome.”The BACKBEAT pivotal study is a global, multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind study investigating the efficacy and safety of AVIM therapy in patients who recently underwent a Medtronic dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker implant and have uncontrolled hypertension (“HTN”) despite the use of antihypertensive medications. The study will randomize approximately 500 patients 1:1 to AVIM along with continued medical therapy and pacing (treatment) or continued medical therapy and pacing alone (control). The study’s primary efficacy endpoint is the between group difference in the change of mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (“aSBP”) at three months post randomization. The primary safety endpoint is freedom from unanticipated serious adverse device effects in the treatment arm at three months post-randomization. Double-blind follow up will continue through 12 months to enable collection of additional clinical endpoints. The Company plans to begin enrollment in the BACKBEAT study before the end of 2023, upon completion of standard clinical trial initiation activities, including clinical center Institutional Review Board approvals.“Hypertension is the most common comorbidity in the pacemaker population, affecting more than 70% of patients. Patients who have pacemakers are generally older and at higher risk for major cardiovascular events. AVIM therapy represents a potentially transformative hypertension treatment for these patients since it can be administered using the same pacemaker they already need and managed by the same physicians already caring for them,” commented Andrea Russo, M.D., Academic Chief, Division of Cardiology, Director of Cardiac Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Services, Cooper University Hospital, and Co-Principal Investigator of the BACKBEAT Study, “We are excited to participate in the BACKBEAT study, which has been thoughtfully designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel therapy.”The BACKBEAT study IDE was supported by encouraging results from MODERATO II, a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, pilot study of pacemaker patients with persistent HTN. MODERATO II showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour aSBP and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients.Video Webcast InformationOrchestra BioMed will host a video webcast with slides today, September 19, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the BACKBEAT Pivotal Study. This webcast can be accessed by clicking on the Events page of the Company’s website, and this press release will be archived on the News Releases page. Within two hours of the webcast, a replay of the webcast and accompanying slides will be available on the Events page.About Hypertension and the Risk of High Blood Pressure in the Pacemaker Population Hypertension (“HTN”) is characterized by elevated blood pressure which increases the force of blood pushing against blood vessels, requiring the heart to work harder and consume more oxygen. HTN accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis and leads to increased risk of major cardiac events like heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease and other end organ damage. HTN is the leading global risk factor for death, affecting an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide. In the United States, 122 million adults, or approximately 47% of all adults, are estimated to have HTN. While many patients do not notice high blood pressure, cardiovascular risk doubles for every 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and the mortality rate doubles with an increase of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure.It is estimated that more than 70% of the approximately 1.1 million people globally who are implanted with cardiac pacemakers each year are also diagnosed with HTN. Based on updated ACC/AHA guidelines, an even higher percentage (approximately 80%) of U.S. patients that are indicated for the implant of a pacemaker have HTN. Pacemaker patients tend to be elderly and are more likely to suffer from co-morbidities such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and harder to treat effectively with medical therapy for many reasons including co-morbidities and a high prevalence of isolated systolic HTN.About AVIM Therapy (BackBeat CNT™)AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients.

255,7b49ec40-eac1-3b11-a2cf-ac5015c2c5e5,MDT,2023-09-20,The 3 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks to Buy in September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-healthcare-stocks-150426527.html,1694617466,STORY,"['DHR', 'MDT', 'HUM', '^GSPC']","[Healthcare is a sector that has underperformed the broader stock market this year. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care Sector Index is down over 2.50% year-to-date versus a 17% gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. The decline has been broad-based as investors focus their capital allocations on high-flying technology stocks at the expense of pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and health insurers. The decline brought valuations down following the Covid-19 pandemic when some of the best-performing stocks in the world were those of pharma companies and other healthcare companies racing to find a cure to the respiratory disease. That provides investors with a long time horizon, an opportunity to pick up some great healthcare stocks at reasonable, if not cheap, prices right now. Here are the three most undervalued healthcare stocks to buy in September 2023.Danaher (DHR)The logo for Danaher (DHR) displayed on a smartphone with a stock chart in the background.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comDanaher (NYSE:DHR) set September 30 as the date when it will officially spin off its environmental and applied solutions business (water-testing and water-quality unit) called Veralto. The new company will begin publicly trading thereafter. This could prove to be the catalyst that Danaher, primarily a medical device maker, has been waiting for. The company’s stock has been in the doldrums lately after more than a decade of outperforming the broader market. In the last 12 months, DHR stock has declined 12%.Concerns about breaking up Danaher’s core businesses primarily caused the decline. However, Danaher said it wants to focus on moving forward with its larger medical device and commercial products units. Some analysts say they expect Danaher will be more aggressive with mergers and acquisitions following the Veralto spin-off, which may also be a catalyst for DHR stock. The company continues to post strong earnings, including results for this year’s second quarter that beat Wall Street forecasts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesHumana (HUM)A Humana (HUM) office buildingSource: Shutterstock.comHealthcare insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) is another stock down in the dumps lately. Year-to-date, HUM stock decreased 6%. Shares are currently trading at a very reasonable 17 times forward earnings estimates. Humana is not the only health insurer that slipped this year. The company’s chief rival, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), saw its stock fall 7% since January. Investors seem concerned about Medicare Advantage cost-trend uncertainty and rising claims from elective surgeries delayed by the pandemic.There are also worries about the upcoming presidential election cycle, following the adage that investors shouldn’t own healthcare stocks during an election year, as the sector is treated like a political football on the campaign trail. Owing to these factors, analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) recently downgraded HUM stock from Overweight to Neutral. JPMorgan also lowered its price target on the stock to $540 per share from $576. Still, long-term Humana remains a leading healthcare stock to own.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comDid you know that medical device manufacturer Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a dividend aristocrat? The company has raised its quarterly payout to shareholders for 45 consecutive years. And Medtronic has a reputation for hiking its dividend by a fair amount, raising it an average of 16% compounded annually for more than four decades. Currently, MDT stock pays a dividend of 69 cents per share each quarter, giving it a yield of 3.39%. The dividend is just one reason to be bullish on Medtronic.The company is also seeing strong demand for its medical devices mostly used in heart and gastrointestinal procedures. The growing demand led the company to post better-than-expected second-quarter financial results and raise its profit forecast.Looking ahead, Medtronic, which makes pacemakers, catheters and other devices, said it now expects its full-year profit in 2023 to be between $5.08 and $5.16 a share, up from a previous range of $5 to $5.10. MDT stock is down 10% over the last 12 months but looks ready for a comeback.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DHR.

But not all REITs are good buys. There are unfortunately several F-rated REITs to sell from which you need to steer clear.REITs are popular with income investors because they have a structure that’s unique from traditional stocks. They don’t pay federal corporate income tax as long as they distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends.That’s great for investors who are looking for a regular income stream.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe performance of REITs can be affected by the economy, of course. If you think corporations are going to continue to allow employees to work a hybrid or remote schedule, then office REITs probably aren’t a good pick. There are a couple on this list of f-rated REITs to sell.During the Covid-19 pandemic, hotel and hospitality REITs took a big hit. Consumer confidence can affect residential REITs whether someone is going to own a home or rent. If they can afford to take on a mortgage or pay higher rent on a year-over-year basis.While there are some fine REITs on the market, each of the equities on this list has some fatal flaws that help lower their grades to an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Extra Space Storage (EXR)Real estate investment trust (REIT) on a black notebook on an office desk.Source: ShutterstockIf you’re downsizing your home, closing down an office or just have too much stuff for your home, then you may use a facility owned by Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR).After completing its merger with Life Storage in June, the Utah-based REIT is the largest storage operator in the U.S., with over 3,500 locations in 43 states.You expect REITs to have a solid yield, but Extra Space Storage has a yield of less than 2%. The stock performance has been a disappointment, down nearly 14% this year, making it one of the f-rated REITs to sell before it’s too late.Earnings for the second quarter missed on both top and bottom lines, coming in at $440.75 million in revenue and EPS of $1.50.Story continuesI think you can find REITs that will give you better performance. EXR stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)Image of a man holding a key chain with a key and house attached to the key ring over a office desk in the backgroundSource: ShutterstockGladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ:GOOD) is an equity REIT, meaning it invests in and owns income-producing real estate.Gladstone’s role is in single-tenant and anchored multi-tenant industrial and office properties.The company has 136 properties in 27 states, stretching from Nevada to Massachusetts. Tenants include offices, drugstores, paper companies, industrial complexes and retailers.Covid-19’s taken a toll on Gladstone, which is working on liquidating its office properties that underperformed so far in 2023 and is focusing on industrial buildings.That helps explain why GOOD stock is down 28% so far this year. The dividend of 40% a year, paid quarterly, helps, with a yield of 9%. However, the stock gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comMedical and hospital REITs are another category of which you can invest. Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is perhaps the biggest of these, with over 440 properties and 44,000 hospital beds.The company operates in 10 countries—the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Finland, Colombia and Australia.But bigger isn’t better. Medical Properties Trust is sagging badly in 2023, down more than 40%, making it one of the f-rated REITs to sell ASAP.The company was the focus of a blistering report in the Wall Street Journal in August that raised questions about the company’s finances.Second-quarter earnings of $337.4 million were down 15% from a year ago, and missed analysts’ expectations for $348.4 million. Earnings per share was a disaster – analysts expected a profit of 20 cents per share and the company instead reported a loss of 5 cents per share.The company also cut its dividend nearly in half, from 29 cents per quarter to 15 cents in an effort to build up cash. That’s not what income investors want to hear.MPW stock gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Crown Castle (CCI)a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buySource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) can best be described as a telecom REIT. The company owns more than 40,000 cell towers, 85,000 miles of fiberoptic cable and 120,000 on-air or under-contract small cell nodes. The company claims to have a presence in every major market in the U.S.The company reclassified as a REIT in 2014 for tax purposes, so you can expect to see oversized dividend payments, and CCI delivers with a 6.4% yield.But why is it a bad REIT to buy? The answer is the headwinds facing the telecom industry these days.For instance, the investment management company Carillon Tower Advisers issued a note of caution to investors in its second-quarter letter: “Crown Castle detracted from performance as telecom companies have temporarily slowed their deployment of additional cellular spectrum. This slowdown could impair future growth for cell tower companies.”Analysts downgraded their outlooks for many telecom stocks this summer after reports that many companies own lead-covered cables, a source of potential liability.CCI stock is down 27% this year and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Power REIT (PW)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockFrom its name alone, you may think that Power REIT (NYSE:PW) is somehow involved in the utility industry, leasing land to power plants or having ownership in utility lines, wells or pipelines. But you’d be wrong.Power REIT is instead in the sustainable real estate business. The company has greenhouses, and solar farmland where it grows food and cannabis. It also has a wholly owned subsidiary, the Pittsburgh &amp; West Virginia Railroad, that includes 132 miles of railroad leased to Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC).But this hasn’t been a good year for Power REIT. Shares are down 65% this year. Revenue in the second quarter was only $217,000, a drop of 90% from a year ago. The company also lost $2.19 million in the quarter, or 69 cents per share.And this is a REIT that doesn’t pay a dividend. Tt hasn’t issued a payout since January 2013. What’s the point of owning a REIT that doesn’t offer an incentive to income investors?PW stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Agree Realty (ADC)a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockAgree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is a Michigan-based retail REIT. The company has more than 2000 properties that include grocery stores, pharmacies, automotive retailers, used car lots, convenience stores and fast-food restaurants.Agree also stands out on this list because instead of paying a quarterly dividend, it has a monthly payout. That could be enticing for investors wanting a consistent income stream, and the current payout is 4.8%.But ADC also suffers from headwinds in the retail sector. Some commercial real estate is suffering from rising interest rates. Brick-and-mortar retailers are under significant pressure. And as the economy suffers, it’s reasonable to expect that some of these businesses working with ADC will also suffer.Agree Realty stock is down 15% this year and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT)a businessperson holds an imaginary blueprint of a houseSource: ShutterstockAshford Hospitality Trust (NYSE:AHT) is a hotel and hospitality REIT. The Dallas-based company owns full-service hotels in 25 states and the District of Columbia.But not all is well in the hotel business, which suffered mightily during the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though travelers are returning, Ashford continues to have some struggles.In July, Bloomberg reported that Ashford was planning to return 19 hotels to lenders, saving $225 million in required debt payments and $80 million in needed capital expenditures. The hotels weren’t performing well enough to cover the REIT’s 8.8% interest rate on the loans, Bloomberg said.The company brought in revenues of only $375.5 million in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago. And the stock price is down 32% in 2023.Ashford is also one of those puzzling dividend stocks that don’t pay a dividend – this REIT hasn’t made a payment to investors since January 2020. For that and other reasons listed here, AHT gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The sBLA is based on data from the KEYNOTE-A18 trial, also known as ENGOT-cx11/GOG-3047, in which KEYTRUDA plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone. If approved, this would be Merck’s third approved indication in cervical cancer and first in an earlier stage of the disease. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of January 20, 2024.""The standard of care for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer has not changed in more than two decades, and the majority of patients will experience recurrence or progression of their disease,"" said Dr. Gursel Aktan, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""If approved, KEYTRUDA will be the first immunotherapy available for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. We are committed to working closely with the FDA to bring KEYTRUDA to these patients who are in need of additional treatment options.""In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in cervical cancer: in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test; and as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.Story continuesAbout KEYNOTE-A18/ENGOT-cx11/GOG-3047KEYNOTE-A18, also known as ENGOT-cx11/GOG-3047, is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04221945) sponsored by Merck and conducted in collaboration with the European Network for Gynaecological Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with EBRT plus concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin), followed by brachytherapy (also known as concurrent chemoradiotherapy) compared to placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk (stage 1B2-2B with lymph node-positive disease, and stage 3-4A with and without lymph node-positive disease per FIGO 2014) locally advanced cervical cancer where patients are treated with definitive intent. The primary endpoints are PFS and overall survival, and secondary endpoints include complete response rate, objective response rate and safety. The trial enrolled 1,060 patients who were randomized to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV]) on Day 1 of each three-week cycle (Q3W) for five cycles followed by KEYTRUDA (400 mg by IV) on Day 1 of each six-week cycle (Q6W) for an additional 15 cycles plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 by IV once per week [QW] for five or six weeks plus EBRT followed by brachytherapy with minimum total radiotherapy dose of 80 Gray Units [Gy] for volume-directed and 75 Gy for point-directed given with the total duration of radiation treatment not to exceed 50 days [with an extension to a maximum of 56 days for unforeseen delays]); orPlacebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 by IV QW for five or six weeks plus EBRT followed by brachytherapy with minimum total radiotherapy dose of 80 Gy for volume-directed and 75 Gy for point-directed given with the total duration of radiation treatment not to exceed 50 days [with an extension to a maximum of 56 days for unforeseen delays]).About Merck’s research in breast and gynecologic cancersMerck is advancing research aimed at improving outcomes for patients affected by breast and gynecologic (ovarian, cervical and endometrial) cancers. Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program across these cancers, comprised of more than 15 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA currently has two approved indications for triple-negative breast cancer and four approved indications across gynecologic cancers (see indications below). Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers, including KEYNOTE-A18, as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer, including KEYNOTE-A18.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Cervical CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

The sNDA is based on data from the LITESPARK-005 trial, in which WELIREG demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to everolimus based on a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. A statistically significant improvement in the trial’s key secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was also demonstrated. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of January 17, 2024.""Patients with advanced RCC whose cancer progresses following immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapies face a poorer prognosis, and for those patients, there is a crucial unmet need for new options with an alternative mechanism of action,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""The FDA’s priority review designation of this application reinforces the urgency to provide new options to previously treated patients with advanced RCC, and we are committed to working closely with the FDA to bring WELIREG to these patients as quickly as possible.""Story continuesWELIREG was the first HIF-2α inhibitor therapy approved in the U.S. and is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.LITESPARK-005 is part of a comprehensive development program for WELIREG, comprised of four Phase 3 trials in RCC, including LITESPARK-011 and LITESPARK-012, evaluating WELIREG in the second-line and treatment-naïve advanced disease settings, and LITESPARK-022, evaluating WELIREG in the adjuvant setting.About LITESPARK-005LITESPARK-005 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04195750) evaluating WELIREG compared to everolimus for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC that has progressed after prior treatment with PD-1/L1 and VEGF-TKI therapies, in sequence or in combination. The dual primary endpoints are PFS and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 746 patients who were randomized to receive WELIREG (120 mg orally once daily) or everolimus (10 mg orally once daily).About renal cell carcinomaRenal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases. In the U.S., approximately 15% of patients with kidney cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage.About WELIREG® (belzutifan) 40 mg tablets, for oral useIndication in the U.S.WELIREG (belzutifan) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery.Selected Safety Information for WELIREGWarning: Embryo-Fetal ToxicityExposure to WELIREG during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of WELIREG. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective non-hormonal contraception as WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective.AnemiaWELIREG can cause severe anemia that can require blood transfusion. In Study 004, anemia occurred in 90% of patients and 7% had Grade 3 anemia. Median time to onset of anemia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 8.4 months). In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, anemia occurred in 76% of patients and 28% had Grade 3 anemia.Monitor for anemia before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Closely monitor patients who are dual UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to potential increases in exposure that may increase the incidence or severity of anemia.Transfuse patients as clinically indicated. For patients with hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;9g/dL, withhold WELIREG until Hb≥9g/dL, then resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue depending on the severity of anemia. For life-threatening anemia or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until Hb ≥9g/dL, then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue.The use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia is not recommended in patients treated with WELIREG.HypoxiaWELIREG can cause severe hypoxia that may require discontinuation, supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization. In Study 004, hypoxia occurred in 1.6% of patients. In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, hypoxia occurred in 29% of patients; 16% were Grade 3 hypoxia.Monitor oxygen saturation before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. For decreased oxygen saturation with exercise (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg), consider withholding WELIREG until pulse oximetry with exercise is greater than 88%, then resume at the same or a reduced dose. For decreased oxygen saturation at rest (e.g., pulse oximeter &lt;88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg) or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until resolved and resume at a reduced dose or discontinue. For life-threatening or recurrent symptomatic hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of hypoxia immediately to a healthcare provider.Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on findings in animals, WELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn Study 004, serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients, including anemia, hypoxia, anaphylaxis reaction, retinal detachment, and central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient each).WELIREG was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 3.3% of patients for dizziness and opioid overdose (1.6% each).Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Those which required dosage interruption in &gt;2% of patients were fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and influenza-like illness.Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse reaction which required dose reduction was fatigue (7%).The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were decreased hemoglobin (93%), anemia (90%), fatigue (64%), increased creatinine (64%), headache (39%), dizziness (38%), increased glucose (34%), and nausea (31%).In Study 001, a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (n=58) treated at the recommended dose, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: edema, cough, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.Drug InteractionsCoadministration of WELIREG with inhibitors of UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 increases plasma exposure of belzutifan, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Monitor for anemia and hypoxia and reduce the dosage of WELIREG as recommended.Coadministration of WELIREG with CYP3A4 substrates decreases concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates, which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates or lead to therapeutic failures. Avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information. Coadministration of WELIREG with hormonal contraceptives may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding.LactationBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialWELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with WELIREG.Use of WELIREG may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose.Based on findings in animals, WELIREG may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential and the reversibility of this effect is unknown.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of WELIREG in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

On Tuesday, the European Commission green-lighted the drug, which is already approved in China. The decision to end the partnership is much more strategically important for BeiGene as a stepping stone to build a franchise in solid tumors than as a driver for sales by itself, said TD Cowen analyst Yaron Werber.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2021 delayed its review for the drug as a second-line treatment in patients with esophageal cancer due to COVID-19 curbs that prevented the regulator from conducting inspections in China.

Data from the study showed a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival in the above-mentioned patient group. The study also observed clinically meaningful results in patients treated with Keytruda, who received adjuvant chemotherapy.Although not binding in nature, the EMA will review the CHMP’s recommendation for marketing authorization to Keytruda for the expanded indication in the EU. A final decision from the regulatory body is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.The marketing authorization application seeks to expand Keytruda’s label as a new adjuvant treatment for the earlier stages of NSCLC.Keytruda was approved for a similar patient population in the United States in January 2023.Merck’s shares have lost 3.1% year to date against the industry’s 8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKeytruda is already approved in the EU for several oncology indications, including melanoma, NSCLC and bladder cancer, among others.Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, is MRK’s blockbuster oncology drug and is currently the standard of care in the treatment of first-line NSCLC. The company is also currently evaluating Keytruda in the earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and co-formulations with the drug.Keytruda is the key revenue generator for Merck.

(NYSE: ROK), the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation, today announced the findings of its report ""Anatomy of 100+ Cybersecurity Incidents in Industrial Operations."" The global study conducted by Cyentia Institute analyzed 122 cybersecurity events that included a direct compromise of operational technology (OT) and/or industrial control system (ICS) operations, collecting and reviewing nearly 100 data points for each incident.The first edition of the report finds nearly 60% of cyberattacks against the industrial sector are led by state-affiliated actors and often unintentionally enabled by internal personnel (about 33% of the time). This corroborates other industry research showing OT/ICS security incidents are increasing in volume and frequency, and are targeting critical infrastructure, such as energy producers.""Energy, critical manufacturing, water treatment and nuclear facilities are among the types of critical infrastructure industries under attack in the majority of reported incidents,"" said Mark Cristiano, commercial director of Global Cybersecurity Services at Rockwell Automation. ""Anticipating that stricter regulations and standards for reporting cybersecurity attacks will become commonplace, the market can expect to gain invaluable insights regarding the nature and severity of attacks and the defenses necessary to prevent them in the future.""Based on incidents analyzed, key findings include: OT/ICS cybersecurity incidents in the last three years have already exceeded the total number reported between 1991-2000.Threat actors are most intensely focused on the energy sector (39% of attacks) – over three times more than the next most frequently attacked verticals, critical manufacturing (11%) and transportation (10%).Phishing remains the most popular attack technique (34%), underscoring the importance of cybersecurity tactics such as segmentation, air gapping, Zero Trust and security awareness training to mitigate risks.In more than half of OT/ICS incidents, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are targeted (53%), with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) as the next-most-common target (22%).More than 80% of threat actors come from outside organizations, yet insiders play an unintentional role in opening the door for threat actors in approximately one-third of incidents.Story continuesIn the OT/ICS incidents studied, 60% resulted in operational disruption and 40% resulted in unauthorized access or data exposure. However, the damage of cyberattacks extends beyond the impacted enterprise, as broader supply chains were also impacted 65% of the time.The research indicates strengthening the security of IT systems is crucial to combatting cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and manufacturing facilities. More than 80% of the OT/ICS incidents analyzed started with an IT system compromise, attributed to increasing interconnectivity across IT and OT systems and applications. The IT network enables communication between OT networks and the outside world and acts as an entryway for OT threat actors. Deploying proper network architecture is critical to strengthening an organization's cybersecurity defenses. It is no longer enough to simply implement a firewall between IT and OT environments. Because networks and devices are connected daily into OT/ICS environments, this exposes equipment in most industrial environments to sophisticated adversaries. Having a strong, modern OT/ICS security program must be a part of every industrial organization's responsibility to maintain safe, secure operations and availability.""The dramatic spike in OT and ICS cybersecurity incidents calls for organizations to take immediate action to improve their cybersecurity posture or they risk becoming the next victim of a breach,"" said Sid Snitkin, vice president, Cybersecurity Advisory Services, ARC Advisory Group. ""The threat landscape for industrial organizations is constantly evolving, and the cost of a breach can be devastating to organizations and critical infrastructure. The report's findings underscore the urgent need for organizations to implement more sophisticated cybersecurity strategies.""The full findings of the report can be found here.Methodology For this report, Rockwell Automation commissioned the Cyentia Institute to analyze data from 122 cybersecurity events across the globe, which occurred from 1982-2022. The Cyentia Institute's team collected and analyzed nearly 100 data points surrounding individual incidents involving the direct compromise or disruption of OT/ICS systems. The resulting report was developed to share instructive insights about actual OT/ICS cybersecurity attack activity.About Rockwell Automation Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) is a global leader in industrial automation and secure digital transformation.

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is an innovative measure of a stock's intrinsic value, based on historical trading multiples, an internal adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an ideal fair trading value for the stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it suggests overvaluation and potentially poor future returns. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, indicating higher future returns.Given this analysis, Rockwell Automation's stock appears to be modestly undervalued.

The U.S. plane maker stated on Wednesday that China would require 8,560 new commercial airplanes through 2042, an increase from the previous forecast of 8,485, as per the company's annual 20-year forecast.This upward revision comes on the back of a strong recovery in domestic air traffic after China emerged from strict Covid controls late last year. ""Domestic air traffic in China has already surpassed pre-pandemic levels and international traffic is recovering steadily,"" said Darren Hulst, Boeing vice president of commercial marketing, in a statement.The growing demand will position China's aviation market as the largest globally and account for one-fifth of the world's plane deliveries over the next two decades, according to Boeing. In their statement titled “Boeing: Fast-growing China domestic air travel driving 20-year demand for 8,560 airplanes,” it was mentioned that China would account for 20% of the global airplane demand through until 2042.China's commercial airliner fleet is expected to more than double to nearly 9,600 jets over the next 20 years, according to Boeing's Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), the company's long-term forecast of demand for commercial airplanes and related services. This growth is driven by economic expansion well above the global average and increasing demand for domestic air travel.The company also anticipates that China's domestic aviation market will be the world's largest by the end of the forecast period, thereby powering demand for 6,470 single-aisle airplanes such as the Boeing 737 MAX family. Along with this demand for single-aisle jets, Chinese carriers are expected to require 1,550 widebody airplanes, mainly to support a growing network of international routes.Story continuesThe forecast also predicts that China's commercial fleet will generate demand for $675 billion in aviation services, including maintenance, repair, training, and spare parts. This growth will drive two-thirds of forecast deliveries in China, while the remainder will replace older jets with modern airplanes that increase efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions.This year marks the 50th anniversary of Boeing airplanes' service in China. Since 1972, when China ordered 10 707 jets to modernize its commercial fleet, Boeing airplanes have become an integral part of China's air travel and cargo system.In other related news, the sighting of an Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Boeing 747 at Boeing's South Carolina facilities has sparked online speculation about a potential Air China order with Boeing to be announced in the coming days.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score.

""By investing in community programs that support equitable access to STEM education early in their education, we can help students see themselves being key contributors as they pursue careers in the life sciences.""Seeing themselves in STEMThe program was designed to inspire students from diverse backgrounds and to give Illumina employees a great opportunity to support their community. Illumina and SD2 took a holistic approach to the ""boot camp"": Many of the participants face food insecurity or lack transportation, so the organizers worked to provide rides and meals. Throughout the two weeks, the intensive curriculum offered students a snapshot of what a career in STEM might look like.""We wanted the students to leave with a stronger sense of belonging in STEM,"" says Karmin Noar, vice president of Strategic Growth at SD2. ""Most are low-income, first-generation students who come from underrepresented backgrounds, so it was really important for this to be a paid experience and provide opportunities for them to gain soft and technical skills.""During the laboratory sections, the students learned about safety, basic pipetting, library preparation, and the different ways genomics can be applied. They were also given career and personal development support to help them better understand their strengths and tell their stories. Each student created an elevator pitch, wrote a r&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute;, built a LinkedIn profile, and developed a personal brand.Story continues""There was a massive shift in the way the interns carried themselves from the beginning of the program to the end,"" says Vanessa Light, Illumina's senior manager of CSR.

An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain a solid demand for its Medicare plans, which falls under the Government business.In addition to the solid inflow of premiums, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.CI resorts to acquisitions to bolster its suite of solutions and capabilities, as well as step into newer geographies and solidify its presence in existing markets. The company is on track to implement its Centene contract beginning in 2024. Cigna collaborated with CarepathRx Health System Solutions to accelerate and expand pharmacy care delivery to a rising number of patients with complex care needs. This would add to its existing offerings and benefit Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth’s clients.A growing cash balance and robust cash-generating abilities will continue to empower Cigna in undertaking business growth investments and prudently deploying capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In February 2023, management approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend. Its dividend yield of 1.7% is higher than the industry average of 1.4%. The company expects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $9.5 billion in 2023.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.The company has been experiencing an increase in pharmacy and other service costs, medical costs and other benefit expenses. Such costs tend to weigh on the company’s margins. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the medical space are HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA, Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM and Atai Life Sciences N.V. ATAI.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group Cigna Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Senior VP of Tax &amp; Chief Accounting Officer, Mary Terese Hoeltzel, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$291 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$283. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Mary Terese Hoeltzel.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Cigna Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Cigna Group shares. In total, Senior VP of Tax &amp; Chief Accounting Officer Mary Terese Hoeltzel sold US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Cigna Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Cigna Group insiders own about US$323m worth of shares (which is 0.4% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Cigna Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Cigna Group makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 3 warning signs for Cigna Group that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

284,e1504312-6707-364a-93c4-dd6f251ade70,TEL,2023-09-20,Estimating The Fair Value Of TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-te-connectivity-182459011.html,1695061499,STORY,['TEL'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, TE Connectivity fair value estimate is US$136Current share price of US$127 suggests TE Connectivity is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$148 analyst price target for TEL is 8.7% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.17bUS$2.37bUS$2.48bUS$2.56bUS$2.64bUS$2.71bUS$2.78bUS$2.85bUS$2.92bUS$2.98bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 3.41%Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.30% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.2%) = US$53bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$25bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$43b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$127, the company appears about fair value at a 6.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TE Connectivity as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.140. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TE ConnectivityStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The contract is expected to get completed by September 2028.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Changes in military dynamics have led to increasing defense spending as a well-funded military can deter sudden assault by other nations. This has led to increasing spending on submarines in order to improvise and upgrade sea warfare capabilities. Looking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during 2023-2028.In this context, it is imperative to mention that General Dynamics’ Electric Boat unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs.

Work related to this deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.Significance of Stinger MissilesRTX’s combat-proven Stinger missile is a lightweight, self-contained air defense system that can be rapidly deployed by ground troops. Its supersonic speed, agility and highly accurate guidance and control system give the weapon an operational edge against cruise missiles and all classes of aircraft.The missile has been enjoying strong demand on account of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Notably, as per a report from Reuters, the RTX won an award worth $687 million from the U.S. Army to deliver up to 1,468 Stinger missiles to Ukraine.Due to its remarkable features that can effectively assist in military operations, the Stinger missile has a strong global footprint. Moreover, the recent performance of the missile in repelling Russian attacks significantly bolstered its demand from the European countries.

If you want to skip our introduction to why 3D manufacturing is one of the most important industries today, then check out 5 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.3D printing is one of the most disruptive technologies in the world today. It has allowed companies and enthusiasts to virtually create any product that they like out of thin air, whilst doing so otherwise would require large machines and hefty investments in fabrication equipment. This enables companies to rapidly build out parts and verify their engineering and design even if the fabrication is done only for testing purposes and mass production will take place through traditional machines.3D printers and additive manufacturing as an industry have moved forward quite rapidly over the course of the past decade or so. They are now used to manufacture some of the most complex engineering products in the world, which can withstand significant forces. Industrial equipment and products manufacturer General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)'s Italian division Avio Aero manufactures jet engine turbine blades with 3D printing, and these end up spinning thousands of times in minute at  unimaginable forces inside a jet engine.For the ancient observer, the process of manufacturing a 3D printed jet engine blade would be nothing short of magic. It involves an electron beam welding together thin layers of metal to create a product that is insusceptible to hairline or microscopic cracks. Additionally, since the machines are capable of building robust components, they can also make other components such as sensor housings. Talking numbers, by using 3D printing to manufacture ""tons"" of components for the 787 aircraft, a Boeing supplier believes that the company can save as much as $3 million in costs over the long term.While $3 million in cost savings for a jet that costs hundreds of million of dollars might seem trivial, the fact that there are other methods to fabricate complex products which are fundamentally different from existing processes shows that there is significant room for innovation on the product front and for markets at the supply end. This potential seems to be on the mind of companies as well, since a study from Ernst &amp; Young (EY) shows that out of 900 businesses surveyed in 2016 and 2019 each, the percentage that are applying additive manufacturing technology in their business operations process grew by more than 2.5x while those that did not intend to apply dropped by 3.7x. These are strong numbers for a small time period and the data also reveals that the highest percentage of business that do use 3D manufacturing are in China and South Korea.Story continuesAnother key benefit of 3D printing is the ability to produce simple products cheaply. A variety of goods, such as skateboards, goggles, and even football helmets are made by additive manufacturing. A key advantage of this is that the supply chains for these products can be easily set up domestically in the U.S. and create more jobs since traditionally such goods are imported from Asian countries where the cost of labor and other mass production inputs are lower.However, even though the potential of 3D printing is immense, the fact still remains that printers are not widely used for mass production. Mass production is the backbone of consumerism and capitalism as it allows firms to churn out billions of products each year with ease and improve the standard of living of consumers. One firm that mass produces products with 3D printing is Sonova. It makes hearing aids through additive manufacturing, and the firm claims that the technology has allowed it to produce hundreds of thousands of customized hearing pieces in a year.Finally, any discussion about 3D printing would be incomplete without SpaceX particularly as aerospace is one of the hottest topics in the media these days. SpaceX was one of the first companies to 3D print a rocket engine, as the firm revealed a thruster for its Dragon spacecraft built through additive manufacturing back in 2013. Another rocket company that is quite agile when it comes to blending the latest manufacturing technology in its production process is Relativity Space. The firm is aiming to compete with SpaceX in the crucial area of rocket reusability and it is designing the Terran R medium lift vehicle (equivalent to SpaceX's Falcon 9). This rocket aims to be fully reusable and manufactured by 3D printing.As to what's happening in the printer industry right now, here's what the executives of Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM) had to say during the firm's latest earnings conference call:Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $53.3 million, a very strong 29% growth over the first quarter of 2023. As you’ll recall, we entered the year with a questionable outlook on the demand side as macro pressures with in our industry. And we certainly felt that in the first quarter.There was a continuation of that softness into the start of the second quarter. However, quarter momentum really began to pick up, and we finished the quarter with strength. While there’s still some element of caution in the environment, we’re very encouraged by the recent customer activity that led to our second quarter results. This momentum gives us confidence in the early signs of a recovery and also validates feedback we’ve been receiving from customers that we would see an uptick in orders as we progress through 2023. In combination with this improved customer demand profile in a variety of near-term growth opportunities, we feel very good about the second half of 2023, and we’re reaffirming our 2023 revenue guidance. Meanwhile, the DM team has been laser-focused on something we have full control of, reducing our cost structure.Today we'll look at some top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks and the top picks in this piece are Apollo Global Management, Inc.

If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, influencing future return expectations.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAssessing VF's Financial HealthDespite VF (NYSE:VFC)'s seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors should not be overlooked. These risks are reflected in its low Piotroski F-score of 2 and Altman Z-score of 1.36. These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap, emphasizing the need for thorough due diligence.Unpacking the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score is a tool used to assess a company's financial health. It evaluates profitability, leverage, liquidity, sources of funds, and operating efficiency.

This decrease is concerning as it indicates potential risks associated with investing in VF.Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendVF's debt-to-total assets ratio has been increasing over the past three years, suggesting escalating financial risk. Additionally, VF's current ratio has been decreasing, indicating deteriorating liquidity and ability to manage immediate financial obligations.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True?

Despite Moderna's efforts to expand its business, it remains heavily reliant on COVID vaccinations and booster shots. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith discuss the details of how the declining demand for COVID immunizations could affect vaccine makers moving forward.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Moderna and Pfizer. Pfizer shares in focus right now as they are moving higher. But Moderna doing the opposite. Moderna lower right now by about 4/10 of a percent. So some fractional moves, but in different direction.This week, the finance chief of Pfizer forecasting weaker demand for COVID shots this year. Pfizer is predicting a roughly 24% COVID vaccination rate in the US this year. That's less than half of the vaccination rate against the flu. You also had something similar come out from Moderna as well.So a larger question-- and for many of these companies, they could have seen this. They should have seen this coming, especially as for the vaccination campaigns that rolled out very early on, and the number of inoculations that were administered at everywhere from a CVS to a Walgreens and Moderna and Pfizer being some of the early beneficiaries of that. There was a larger question of, OK, so what would that tail cycle look like, as you started to see a wind down in the push for, but also, the receipt of vaccinations, even if that was on a booster basis going forward.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And we certainly know that this is so important to their businesses, especially though for Moderna. And that's really why we saw such a reaction in their stock yesterday following this announcement here, I guess you can call it, from Pfizer's CFO.But they're working to diversify their business. They've been doing that for quite some time. But they're still heavily reliant on COVID shots, at least for now, when you talk about their business in 2023, even into early 2024. So any sort of expectation of weaker than expected demand obviously is going to have a real impact on Moderna's shares specifically.Story continuesAnd we saw Moderna get hit pretty hard yesterday. The biggest one-day decline that we've seen since the start of the year closed down yesterday, off about 9%. Off another 1% or so this morning. Now essentially flat though on the day. So we'll see what exactly those numbers look like.24%, like you just said, of forecast that Pfizer is expecting Americans will get updated COVID shots. A bit better than what we saw last time. Only about 17% got the booster that was released last fall, as of May. So a bit of an uptick there on a year-over-year basis. But certainly well below what Moderna, what Pfizer, and what many investors have been hoping to see.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Something we're continuing to track, especially as we consider the amount of people that might look at, and hear any news about the newest variant, and decide, OK, just let me get booster before the winter comes.SEANA SMITH: It doesn't hurt to be safe.]"

The program included the phase IIb/III ALLEGRO study, evaluating Litfulo in patients aged 12 years and older with alopecia areata with 50% or more scalp hair loss, including patients with alopecia totalis (total scalp hair loss) and alopecia universalis (total body hair loss).Per the data from the pivotal study, it was observed that 13.4% of adults and adolescents saw 90% or more scalp hair coverage after 24 weeks of treatment with Litfulo 50 mg compared to 1.5% with placebo. The study also met its key secondary endpoint of moderate-to-great improvement (49.2%) in alopecia areata patients, as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change, at week 24, compared with placebo (9.2%).Year to date, shares of Pfizer have plunged 34.3% against the industry’s 7.5% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEli Lilly’s (LLY) Olumiant (baricitinib) is currently approved in the EU to treat adult patients with severe alopecia areata and moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Lilly’s Olumiant is also a JAK inhibitor but is indicated only for adult patients in the treatment of severe alopecia areata. With the approval of Litfulo in the EU, the drug becomes the first EC-approved medicine to be indicated for adolescent patients, as young as 12 years of age, with severe alopecia areata. Eligible patients, approved for Pfizer’s Litfulo, are greater than Lilly’s Olumiant, which could help PFE capture a greater share of the alopecia areata market.Ritlecitinib was approved in the United States and Japan in June 2023.We would like to remind the investors that the authorization by the EC follows the positive opinion adopted by the advisory committee of the European Medicines Agency in July 2023, recommending marketing authorization for Litfulo for patients aged 12 years and older, with severe alopecia areata.Story continuesPFE is currently evaluating Litfulo in an ongoing long-term phase III ALLEGRO-LT study, collecting the safety and efficacy data for adults with alopecia areata with 25% or greater scalp hair loss and adolescents from 12 years and older with alopecia areata with 50% or greater scalp hair loss. The regulatory filing with the EC comprised such long-term efficacy and safety data to support the approval.Besides alopecia areata, Pfizer is also currently evaluating ritlecitinib in other potential indications.

If you want to read about some more worst performing currencies, go directly to 5 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023. A rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the United States was expected to push the US dollar, the official currency in the country and the most popular globally, lower this year. However, robust economic data from the US, as well as a slowdown in major economies around the globe, has fueled rebound growth in the US dollar. This growth has also pressured the economics of prominent world powers, like China and Japan, who have been forced to resort to stimulus measures aimed at shoring up their local currencies. Prominent financial stocks in the US like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all jumped in value due to the prevailing economic conditions. Per data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the net short bets on the dollar shrank to $7.17 billion in early September, from $21.28 billion in late July. The July figure was a two-year high. Market experts, like Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign exchange and macro strategist at investment bank UBS, believe the data highlights the strength of the US economy against the rest of the world. The strength of the US dollar can be viewed in context of the challenging economic conditions in China and loose monetary policy in other developing countries. Surging global prices for energy and food are also contributing to this strength in the dollar as other currencies go on a downward spiral. Japanese and Chinese authorities, as well as governments around the world, are stepping up regulations on foreign exchange markets to stop the rut. Edward Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA and a veteran global currency strategist, believes that actions need to follow statements from fiscal chiefs. Per Moya, the markets are not convinced of Japanese attempts to deal with currency rates and that attempts to limit the liquidity of the yuan are likely not to overcome the pressure a weakening economy has placed on the currency. The strength of the US dollar can be measured by the US dollar index, which measures the performance of the USD against a basket of global currencies. In the past four weeks, this index is up by nearly 3%, to the highest levels seen since March. The past week has been especially kind on the index as it registered a jump of nearly 2% in a few days. Story continuesThe strength of the dollar has hit currencies in developing nations. Coupled with rising inflation, inaction on parts of central banks, and trade deficit numbers, several currencies have nose-dived in value over the past few months. Government in these nations, like Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Syria, have all been forced to look to international lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for dollar inflows to stabilize the worsening economic conditions. Whether these bailouts are effective in the face of loose monetary policies is still up for debate.Our MethodologyIn this article, we will list the 15 worst performing currencies of 2023. The ranking is calculated by calculating the percentage decrease in value of the currencies in terms of the US dollar value. The currencies in which the percentage decrease in value in terms of the US dollar are the highest are considered the worst performing. Data for this purpose has been taken from foreign exchange company XE. An initial data set comprising the 50 worst currencies with the highest value against the US dollar on January 2, 2023 was used. The percentage decrease was calculated by comparing this value against the worth of the currency against the US dollar on September 15, 2023. Digital coins were excluded from the list. 15 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023Pixabay/Public DomainWorst Performing Currencies of 202315. Zambian KwachaPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 18 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 20Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 11%The Kwacha is the currency of Zambia, a country in Africa that borders Zimbabwe. The country used the British pound as the legal tender till 1964 before shifting to Kwacha. The Kwacha has taken a hit against the US dollar in recent months as private sector spending contracts, inflation hits record highs, and the central bank of the country raises interest rates to around 10% to combat rising prices. The Zambian currency is subject to uncertainty due to debt restructuring and dwindling copper production. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all warned investors of the unstable economic situation in Zambia. 14. South African RandPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 17 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 19Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 11%South African Rand is the official currency of South Africa. One of the reasons for the bad performance of the Rand this year has been the interest rate hikes in the US that have had a net negative impact on emerging economies. Another important factor has been Chinese influence in the country. China is the biggest trading partner of South Africa and reports of a slowdown in the Chinese economy have hit the currency throughout the year, although fresh stimulus measures from Beijing have provided some monetary relief in recent weeks. 13. Rwandan FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 1070 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 1207Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 12.8%Rwandan Franc is the official currency of Rwanda, a country in Africa that borders Uganda. Stubborn inflation has forced the central bank in the country to raise key interest rates this year, resulting in a downward spiral with regards to the currency. Despite the rate increases, inflation numbers in the country continue to make headlines. In August 2023, the annual inflation rate in Rwanda increased to 17.4%, up from 17.3% in July. 12. Lao KipPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 17279 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 19949Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 15%Lao Kip is the legal tender in Laos, a Southeast Asian country bordered by Myanmar and China. Kip has been the official currency in the country since 1955. A spike in commodity prices and a tightening of global financial conditions have resulted in Kip losing value against the US dollar this year. The proximity to China and the impact of a slowing Chinese economy have also made it harder for the Kip to gain in value. External liquidity pressures, a widening circular debt, and large external debt repayments all continue to haunt the currency. 11. Sierra Leonean LeonePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 18854 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 22457Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 19%Sierra Leonean Leone is the official currency of Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa that borders Guinea. High energy and food prices, partly due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have forced the poor African country to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for loan programs. Foreign exchange reserves of the country are also dwindling, forcing further pressure on the local currency. This situation is expected to continue in the coming months and the country remains at risk of debt distress. 10. Congolese FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 2036 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 2466Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 21%Congolese Franc is the official currency of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The currency has depreciated against the US dollar this year as the government amps up spending to fight the M23 rebel group. Salary arrears payments and rising inflation have contributed to this decline as well. The economy of the country is reliant on imports and this has also increased economic instability. Per the World Bank, the country is one of the poorest in the world, with about two-thirds of the population of 100 million living on less than $2.10 a day. 9. Egyptian PoundPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 24 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 30Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 25%The Egyptian Pound is the official currency of Egypt, the 14th-most populated country in the world, and the third-most populated in Africa. The annual urban inflation rates in the country have skyrocketed in recent months, touching 37.4% in August this year, up from 36.5% in the previous month. These figures remain significantly above the target range of the central bank and market expectations. In a country where a disproportionately large number of inhabitants live in urban areas, this inflation, coupled with macro pressures and a shortage of foreign currency, has resulted in a strong depreciation of the currency. 8. Pakistani RupeePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 226 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 296Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 31%Pakistani Rupee is the official currency of Pakistan, a South Asian country that borders India and China. Persistent inflation, an import economy, and a large circular debt crisis are some of the reasons why the Rupee has faced strong headwinds in recent months. A debt restructuring plan by the government, which included going to the IMF for help, has also been on the radar of investors who want to put money into the Pakistani economy. The Rupee has been gaining against the US dollar in recent weeks but it is not clear whether these gains will translate to meaningful stability in the economic domain. 7. Russian RublePrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 71 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 96Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 35%Russian Ruble is the official currency of Russia, the largest country in the world that has a huge geopolitical influence on Europe and Asia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine last year forced Western countries to impose tough sanctions on Russian imports. These sanctions even had an impact on top Russian exports such as energy and food, driving up global inflation numbers and contributing to a freefall in the value of the Ruble against the US dollar. These pressures remain intact this year, as Moscow deals with internal rebellions over the war. 6. Burundian FrancPrice Against 1 USD on January 2, 2023: 2070 Price Against 1 USD on September 15, 2023: 2832Percentage Decline in Price in 2023: 36%Burundian Franc is the official currency of Burundi, a country in Africa that borders Rwanda. Burgeoning government debt, persistent inflation, and rising food prices have all contributed to a decline in the value of the local currency against the US dollar this year. Governmental policies to tackle economic instability, which include the issuing of new 5,000 and 10,000 Burundian franc banknotes, have not been met with the expected reaction, as shortages lead to mass protests and increased economic skepticism. Top firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have all warned investors of the unstable economic situation in Burundi.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Worst Performing Currencies of 2023. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

Schulman, however, will continue to serve on PayPal's board until May 2024.The leadership change comes during a challenging period for the fintech giant. Over the past two years, PayPal's shares have plummeted by over 75%, attributable to diminishing investor interest in fintech companies, escalating competition from Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAPL), and a slowdown in its branded checkout business growth.Chriss, an experienced executive hailing from Intuit (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:INTU), is perceived as a potential catalyst for PayPal's recovery. However, Wall Street analysts caution that the company's turnaround could be a protracted process.Lisa Ellis, an analyst from MoffettNathanson, recently downgraded PayPal's shares from Outperform to Market Perform and reduced her price target on the shares from $85 to $75. Ellis attributed this downgrade to Apple's growing dominance in the payments sector and its implications for PayPal. She also pointed out that PayPal's gross profit growth has stagnated over the years, transitioning from double digits between 2018 and 2021 to low- to mid-single digits currently.Ellis further emphasized that Chriss faces a formidable task of filling key roles within the company. PayPal currently has several positions either vacant or filled on an interim basis, including chief operating officer, chief financial officer, treasurer, and chief strategy officer. Amidst the company's ongoing struggles, attracting top-tier talent could be a significant challenge.Despite these hurdles, the upcoming leadership change presents an opportunity for PayPal to recalibrate its strategic direction. However, analysts suggest that substantial changes might require time.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)New findings released today as a preview of the IBM 2023 Sustainable Business Snapshot1, conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of IBM, revealed that there's a perception gap among corporate sustainability professionals, including sustainability and IT decisionmakers. 93% of respondents think their company is somewhat or very mature in using data to track sustainability progress. But only 45% say they are ready to report on Scope 3 emissions.IBM Envizi has been helping organizations to collect, calculate, analyze and report on GHG emissions for over a decade. IBM Envizi offers coverage for all 15 Scope 3 categories, using a calculation engine to apply GHG Protocol calculation methods that are underpinned by a robust data management system. It includes automated data capture, supplier survey data capture, Scope 3 emissions factor libraries, reporting framework templates, a dedicated Scope 3 analytics dashboard, audit tools and functionality to support supplier benchmarking analysis.The new functionality in Envizi announced today helps address one of the key challenges organizations face with Scope 3 emissions, which is the categorization of spend data drawn from financial or ERP systems.With the addition of automated text classification using NLP,  IBM Envizi can help streamline this process by aggregating, managing, categorizing and preparing spend data, ultimately to help produce a unified and up-to-date dataset that maps to country and industry-specific emissions factors. To complement this functionality, IBM Envizi now includes an embedded spend-based emissions factor library that is harmonized across over 180 countries, creating uniformity in Scope 3 calculations for purchased good and services. These datasets are designed to help organizations to produce their emissions calculations quickly, accurately and efficiently.Story continues""Growing regulatory requirements and external interests are driving organizations to disclose GHG emissions, including those from Scope 3,"" said Christina Shim, Vice President and Global Head, Product Management and Strategy, IBM Sustainability Software. ""As requirements increase and as organizations prioritize enhancing operational insights, so does the need for robust, auditable data management, calculation, and reporting processes. IBM Envizi is now integrated with the new capabilities to help organizations seamlessly garner insights from spend data to facilitate Scope 3 emissions calculations for ESG reporting.""For example, a manufacturer may buy computer and electronic components from various suppliers. In one entry, these components may be recorded as 'chips,' and in another, they may be called 'hard drives.'  Ultimately, they all need to be in the category of 'computer and electronic components' so the correct emissions factor can be applied. This application of text classification can help to automatically categorize potentially thousands of lines of spend data so teams can focus on higher value work.IBM Envizi complements IBM's existing portfolio of sustainability solutions and consulting expertise, including IBM Planning Analytics, IBM Supply Chain Intelligence Suite, IBM Maximo Application Suite, and IBM Turbonomic, that help organizations set, operationalize, and drive their environmental sustainability goals.For more information about the IBM Envizi ESG Suite, click here.Methodology for the Morning Consult ""Sustainable Business Snapshot:"" This poll was conducted online by Morning Consult in August 2023 among a sample of 3,250 global business leaders, employed at companies with 1,000 or more employees.

To achieve this goal at a global scale, IBM is expanding AI education collaborations with universities globally, collaborating with partners to deliver AI training to adult learners, and launching new generative AI coursework through IBM SkillsBuild. This will expand upon IBM's existing programs and career-building platforms to offer enhanced access to AI education and in-demand technical roles.According to a recent global study conducted by IBM Institute of Business Value, surveyed executives estimate that implementing AI and automation will require 40% of their workforce to reskill over the next three years, mostly those in entry-level positions. This further reinforces that generative AI is creating a demand for new roles and skills.""AI skills will be essential to tomorrow's workforce,"" said Justina Nixon-Saintil, IBM Vice President &amp; Chief Impact Officer. ""That's why we are investing in AI training, with a commitment to reach two million learners in three years, and expanding IBM SkillsBuild to collaborate with universities and nonprofits on new generative AI education for learners all over the world.""AI training for universitiesIBM is collaborating with universities at a global level to build capacity around AI leveraging IBM's network of experts.

It may not have been easy to hold on to MPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marathon Petroleum's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marathon Petroleum's main business drivers.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum operates in two segments: Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation.Refining and Marketing: The unit’s operations include 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent regions of the United States, having a combined crude processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day. Additionally, Marathon Petroleum – through its marketing organization – sells transportation fuels, asphalt and specialty products throughout the country to support commercial, industrial and retail operations. In 2022, the Refining &amp; Marketing segment recorded a profit of $16.4 billion.Story continuesMidstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP - publicly-traded master limited partnerships that own and operate gathering and processing assets along with crude transportation and logistics infrastructure. Marathon Petroleum owns 63.6% each of MPLX’s and ANDX’s common units. The 'Midstream' segment reported total earnings of $4.5 billion in 2022.In 2021, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain – for $21 billion.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and a total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Marathon Petroleum ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $4,718.99, or a 371.90% gain, as of September 19, 2023, according to our calculations.

The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the covid lows, the sector is not out of the woods yet in terms of cash flows that remain tepid and well below the pre-crisis levels. In particular, the weakness in business travel demand remains a complicating factor. The continued increase in costs and expenses over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are other negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.44%, and there have been 8 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower.

As of June 2023, the company's ROCE stands at 5.6%.This return rate is relatively low in absolute terms and also falls short of the beverage industry's average ROCE of 16%. Comparatively, Molson Coors Beverage's current ROCE has remained mostly flat when analyzed against its previous returns.The company's capital employed has also largely remained unchanged over the past five years. These characteristics are commonly associated with businesses that have transitioned beyond their growth phase and have settled into steady operations.Monday's data further suggests that unless there is a significant shift in Molson Coors Beverage's ROCE or an increase in its investments, it is unlikely to become a multi-bagger. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the company distributes 35% of its income as dividends to shareholders. This distribution indicates that the business is not heavily reinvesting in itself, making it reasonable to share a portion of earnings with its shareholders.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Start with Wall Street,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opinion-whos-blame-united-auto-100144028.html,1695204104,STORY,"['GM', 'STLAM.MI']","[Union members walk the picket line at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne this week. (Paul Sancya / Associated Press)The United Auto Workers are striking against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — the Big Three — to make up for lost ground. Since 2003 the average hourly wages of UAW production workers have declined by 30%, adjusting for inflation. A large portion of those losses came when the autoworkers were compelled to help bail out GM in 2008 as it went bankrupt.The worker concessions included a decadelong wage freeze for those hired before 2007, lower pay and benefits for new hires including the elimination of defined pensions, and the shift of the healthcare benefit fund from the company to the union. The concessions also permitted the use of lower-paid temp workers who could earn $18 an hour working alongside a longtime employee earning $32 per hour while doing the same tasks.Read more: Workers go on strike at all Big 3 Detroit automakers for the first time in historyThe union wants to end these concessions while also gaining a 40% wage increase over the next four years to match the 40% compensation increases received by Big Three chief executives over the last four years. The UAW has said that if contract negotiations don’t advance by Friday, it will expand the strike beyond the three plants currently targeted.The federal government’s $80-billion bailout and worker concessions saved GM. Many who supported the bailout expected the company, when it returned to profitability, to invest heavily in electric vehicle research, development and production: The taxpayers saved GM, so now GM should help ameliorate global warming that harms us all.But Wall Street had other ideas. In 2015 it swooped in to capture these newly minted profits by pressuring GM management to conduct a stock buyback of $8 billion. Made possible by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b-18, put in place in 1982, buybacks are a method of profit extraction allowing companies to use their profits to buy back their own shares, thus increasing the value of all outstanding shares. Hedge funds and the like take large stock positions in companies, demand buybacks that quickly increase the price of their shares and then cash out with significant profits.Story continuesRead more: Opinion: A big Clinton-era failure is one key reason labor unions are having a moment in L.A. and beyondThis pattern happened with GM in the years following the bailout: The giant hedge fund Appaloosa Management joined with other funds to buy up 2.1% of GM shares. These efforts succeeded and then some: GM announced $5 billion in buybacks in March 2015, another $4 billion later that year and another $5 billion in 2017. At the same time, the company planned to cut 14,000 jobs and idle five automotive plants.In addition to rewarding Wall Street share-sellers, stock buybacks also increase the pay of top corporate executives. As of 2021, stock awards and options made up 82% of total CEO compensation. Approximately 75% of all non-financial corporate profits went to stock buybacks in the decade after the automaker bailout. In the 12 months ending in March 2022, buybacks transferred $1.5 trillion of corporate profits to share-sellers. Stellantis, which purchased Chrysler, Fiat and Peugeot in 2021, even had the audacity to announce a $1.6-billion stock buyback in February ahead of negotiations with the UAW.Today none of the Big Three are worried about bankruptcy: Collectively they are expected to earn $32 billion in profits in 2023. The automakers claim those profits are desperately needed to make the historic shift to electric vehicles and fend off their nonunion competitors such as Tesla. Meeting the UAW demands, they claim, would cut those investments while forcing the companies to move more production to lower-wage areas here and abroad.Read more: Column: Why an auto workers strike should have your supportWhat they neglect to say is that Wall Street’s shadow also hovers over these negotiations. As Stellantis made crystal-clear when it authorized stock buybacks this year, the industry is more than willing to divert badly needed investment funds into the pockets of top executives and powerful Wall Street firms.A stock buyback, of course, does not strengthen the company. It does not create investment in new plants and equipment. It does not upgrade the skills of the workforce. And it does not improve health and safety or increase research and development to mitigate climate change. In fact, it decidedly detracts from all of these critical functions by eating up the money to fund them. Billions spent on buybacks means billions less not only for workers’ wages but also for developing high-quality, affordable electric vehicles to forge the transition to a green, sustainable economy.For the first time in a generation the labor movement is held in high esteem by the American public. It is widely understood that working people need the protections only collective bargaining can provide. This puts unions like the UAW at the forefront of the struggle to protect jobs and the environment. Perhaps these difficult negotiations can help us all realize just how much stock buybacks threaten both economic fairness and the health of our climate.Les Leopold is the executive director of the Labor Institute and author of the forthcoming book “Wall Street’s War on Workers: How Mass Layoffs and Greed Are Destroying the Working Class and What to Do About It.”If it’s in the news right now, the L.A.

Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman explains why this could just another move for Trump to get attention.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: You've also been following everything about the strikes but also who is visiting, who is saying what about the strikes. And we understand the former President Trump has also been making some selective visits. What do you know about that so far?RICK NEWMAN: Well, he said that his plan is instead of participating in the next Republican debate, which I think is on September 27, he's going to go somewhere to-- somewhere in the Upper Midwest and address striking autoworkers.Now this is interesting because the UAW, the United Auto Workers Union, did not endorse Trump in 2020. The union endorsed Joe Biden in 2020. And Trump, of course, is pissed off about that. So the main thing he's been saying about the strike is that the UAW leaders suck. And they're selling out the workers.So very interesting to see what kind of message Trump is gonna have for the Union Workers. He's not-- he's not really taking their side so much against the automakers that they are striking. He's taking the autoworkers side against their own union leaders who are the ones representing them in these strikes.So if that's what comes off, I mean, that's a fairly muddled message from Trump. I'm not sure that's gonna do him any good. But, look, I mean, we all know he's looking for ways to get some attention without attending the GOP debates. So I wonder if the storyline is gonna emerge that Trump is kind of using the autoworkers just as an attention getting ploy for himself.]"

Stellantis says it has resumed negotiations, however citing constructive discussions.On Friday, 9% of the union's nearly 150,000 members, they downed their tools. And joining us now with her take on what sets these strikes apart is Erica Groshen, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations senior economic advisor. Erica, thank you for joining us today. What do you make of the latest here?ERICA GROSHEN: Well, in some ways it's not terribly surprising. We certainly have a very strong labor market, a very strong economy and strike activity usually rises when the economy and the labor market is strong. So we have the immediate conditions.Story continuesAnd then we are in a time of technological change, say, for entertainment professionals, the growth of generative AI. For autoworkers, we're talking about the move to electric vehicles and robotics. So that's a play. And the administration is more friendly to organized labor, that helps. So we have a lot of things that suggest that we're going to have labor market activity and they're probably behind a lot of what we're seeing.DIANE KING HALL: So Erica, we saw a summer of strikes. And basically, this is heading over into the fall now with a lot of different kind of sectors of the economy. Now UAW threatening that their strike could expand on Friday if, you know, there's not more ""serious progress,"" quote, made. What is the expectation for the impact to the economy from your view, especially if these strikes continue to extend now?ERICA GROSHEN: Well-- so I mean, as an economist, I always say on the one hand, on the other hand, right? So here we go. I mean, this actually could be good if it ushers in an economic period like we had during the 1960s when unionism was more widespread and there was more activism. But this was a period with very high productivity growth, improved living standards for all workers, less inequality than we see now. So it could be turning a corner to get back to some of the salient features that we've had before.On the other hand, of course, it could be bad if we see labor strife without creative cooperative solutions to workplace issues, which, of course, include pay and benefits, but also training, working conditions, worker voice, like that. And then there's always a possibility that's neutral, this is just a flash in the pan and we go back to the trends that we were on for a long time. So I think the jury is still out, but there is potential for this to actually be a force for creativity and cooperative solutions going forward.]"

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said the union would announce more plant strikes if no serious progress was made in negotiations on a new labor deal with the big three auto makers by Friday at noon. Thousands of UAW members at Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), General Motors Co.

And that will mark more than a week of the Big Three failing to make progress in negotiations toward reaching a deal that does right by our members.”Ed Clark (L) and other UAW members picket outside the Jeep Plant gate that management uses on Sept. 18, 2023 in Toledo, Ohio. The UAW walked out of three locations on Thursday night at midnight, marking the first time they've been simultaneously on strike at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, the Big Three automakers. (Sarah Rice/Getty Images) (Sarah Rice via Getty Images)The UAW did not indicate which factories or facilities would be affected, or if workers would return to current strike-hit factories, which include GM’s Wentzville Assembly, Stellantis’ Toledo Assembly, and Ford’s Michigan Assembly, or if they will continue to stay on the picket line.The automakers say they have been at the bargaining table ready to negotiate, with Stellantis the latest to confirm Monday that it is indeed in talks with the UAW following its latest contract proposal submitted over the weekend.Stellantis said it improved its offer to the UAW, offering an immediate 10% pay increase, with wages increasing by 21% over the course of the contract. Though tiers would remain, Stellantis said it would bring down the number of years for union members to earn the highest wage, to four years from eight. Stellantis said it also offered an “inflation protection measure” to offset the costs of inflation, though details were not given.GM hasn’t issued a public statement on its current negotiations since Sept. 14, the day before the stand up strikes began. Ford has not provided an update either, though it said on Tuesday that it has agreed to continue negotiations with autoworkers in Canada beyond the Sept. 18, 11:59 p.m. ET expiration of its current agreement with those workers.Story continuesSpillover effects … and presidential politicsFormer President Donald Trump speaks at the Pray Vote Stand Summit, Friday, Sept. 15, 2023, in Washington. (Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)With the strike entering its fifth day, spillover effects are being felt by other parts of the auto industry. Parts makers and other suppliers are starting to feel the pain.Component maker CIE Newcor in Michigan said it may have to lay off nearly 300 people; German auto giant ZF said it has already started layoffs at certain locations in Michigan; and US Steel said it was idling one of its furnaces at a steel plant in Illinois as part of a ""risk mitigation” plan.Political pressure is heating up for President Joe Biden, with Democrats in states like Michigan saying the president should do more to shore up his base in the swing state, particularly as Republican opponent former President Donald Trump plans to hold a rally with autoworkers this week.President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the contract negotiations between the UAW and the Big Three auto companies in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday, Sept. 15, 2023. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)""President Biden can take over the narrative and show that the administration, and Democrats as a whole, are supporting their biggest base, which are unions and the working class,"" Michigan State Representative Donavan McKinney said to the Washington Post. ""It would speak volumes … What can we do to get Biden here?""McKinney added the prospect of Trump coming to Michigan to rally before Biden would be “terrible.”Biden said last week that “record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW,” the question now being how far the president will go to show he supports that message, though joining the picket line may be a move too far.Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to members of the UAW during a rally in Detroit, Mich., on Sept. 15, 2023. (Matthew Hatcher / AFP via Getty Images) (MATTHEW HATCHER via Getty Images)For his part, Trump said he supports the union workers, just not union leadership.“The auto workers are being sold down the river by their leadership, and their leadership should endorse Trump,” Trump said to NBC News' Kristen Welker in an interview. Trump added that with the industry's push toward electric vehicles and China's dominance with EV manufacturing, the UAW would not “have any jobs."" Trump has attacked Biden’s EV push, claiming it impedes Americans' choices, among other issues.Though the UAW has its own issues with Biden’s EV push, and subsequent loans for automakers to build new EV and battery factories, UAW's Fain won’t go so far as to endorse Trump.“Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,” Fain said in a statement issued early Tuesday morning. “We can’t keep electing billionaires and millionaires that don’t have any understanding what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to get by and expecting them to solve the problems of the working class.”Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

These names are among the largest in the world and have raised their dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.There are currently just 67 Dividend Aristocrats, further proving how the exclusive nature of the index is and how difficult increasing distributions can be.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MKC. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Just as important is total returns as buying overvalued stocks because of their income can often lead to poor results. This analysis will examine two Dividend Aristocrats that are trading below their intrinsic value that also offer market-beating dividend yields.McCormickThe first name for consideration is McCormick &amp; Co. (NYSE:MKC). Founded in the late 1800s, the company has transformed from a small, door-to-door business into a giant in the spice and seasoning industry. McCormick is valued at $21 billion and generates revenue of $6.4 billion annually.One of the companys competitive advantages is simply its vast size compared to competitors. Today, McCormick controls roughly 20% of the spice and seasoning market, making it the largest name in a highly fragmented industry. This gives it significant advantages over small players when it comes to store placement and pricing power.McCormicks portfolio of products includes its namesake branded spices, but also Lawrys, Zatarains and Thai Kitchen. Some of the more recent additions to the product lineup include Frank RedHot in 2017 and Cholula Hot Sauce in 2020. The addition of these two brands positioned the company to have the top two grossing hot sauces in what is a $5 billion market.Story continuesThe company also offers its products to consumers and industry customers all over the world, providing it some diversification within its business.It also tends to hold up well during recessions. Earnings per share grew 22% during the 2007 to 2009 period and 6% in 2020 and 8% in 2021 during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic.A dominating business model has paved the way for the company to grow its dividend for 36 consecutive years. The dividend has a compound annual growth rate of 9% since 2013. The dividend is likely to continue to grow due to the expected payout ratio of 59% for the year. Shares yield 2%, which is ahead of the average yield of 1.5% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.McCormick has a GF Score of 92 out of 100. Stocks with higher scores often outperform those with lower scores, according to GuruFocus research. The company's score implies above-average returns moving forward.2 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats for Growth and IncomeThe company has a perfect score for momentum and near-perfect marks for growth and profitability. These are partially offset by average scores for value and financial strength.McCormick is trading at a discount to its GF Value Line. This suggests the stock is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value, based on the companys historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts projections for future.The stock has a current price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.82. Reaching its GF Value would result in a potential return of nearly 23% from current levels before the added benefit of the dividend.2 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats for Growth and IncomeJ.M. SmuckerThe second stock to consider is J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE:SJM), which was founded in 1897. Originally, the company consisted of a small cider mill that used apples to produce apple cider and butter. Today, the company is valued at $13 billion and produces revenue in excess of $8 billion annually.J.M. Smuckers portfolio consists of a wide variety of products that consumers have come to trust. This includes its namesake Smuckers products as well as brands such as Jif, Folgers, Dunkin and Knotts Berry Farm. In addition, the company sells pet foods such as Milk Bone and 9Lives. This diverse lineup of products allows the company to reach a variety of customers needs. J.M. Smucker also has the leading position in multiple categories.The company also enjoys strong brand loyalty. It has raised its prices in recent years to help offset inflationary pressures, but volumes have remained steady or increased, showing that consumers have been willing to pay up for these brands.As with McCormick, J.M. Smucker also resides in the packaged food space, which is an area of the economy that tends to be more recession-proof than most. For example, the companys earnings per share grew 39% from 2007 to 2009. J.M. Smucker performed reasonably well during the Covid-19 pandemic as well, with earnings growth 3% and 14% in 2020 and 2021.On the strength of this business model, J.M. Smucker has raised its dividend for 27 consecutive years, making the company one of the newest Dividend Aristocrats. Shareholders have seen their dividends grow by 6.5% annually over the last decade. The stocks dividend yield of 3.3% should be safe as the expected payout ratio for this year is just 52%.J.M. Smuckers GF Score is 74 out of 100 as the stock is expected to produce just average returns.2 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats for Growth and IncomeThe company has average scores for profitability, value and financial strength. Growth and momentum are on the lower end of the scale.That said, J.M. Smucker is trading at a sizeable discount to its GF Value Line. At a ratio of 0.86, J.M. Smucker could provide a return of nearly 16%. Add in the dividend yield and total returns could begin to approach 20%.2 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats for Growth and IncomeFinal thoughtsThere are less than 70 Dividend Aristocrats in the entire marketplace, demonstrating just how difficult it is for companies to increase dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. To qualify as such, a company must have a business model that works in all economic environments by offering products and services customers rely upon.McCormick and J.M. Smucker are two Dividend Aristocrats who have proven their respective business models can mean dividend growth for multiple decades. Each stock could also see double-digit returns given that each name is trading well below its intrinsic value. Investors looking for growth and income should consider adding each name to their watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Positive revisions have hit across all timeframes.The company resides within the Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry, which is currently ranked in the top 8% of all industries thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions.As many know, roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries seeing improved outlooks.Aside from the favorable earnings outlook, let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of Owens Corning.Current StandingOC shares have been red-hot in 2023, up more than 50% and widely outperforming the S&amp;P 500. As we can see below by the green arrows circled, shares have been boosted post-earnings following back-to-back quarterly releases.Regarding the most recent quarterly release, OC exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 25% and posted revenue 2% ahead of expectations. Impressively, the company has exceeded bottom line expectations by an average of 18% across its last four releases.In addition, income-focused investors could be attracted to Owens Corning, with shares currently yielding 1.5% annually. And the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, boasting an 18% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Story continuesThroughout its latest quarter, the company returned more than $160 million to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks.OC shares aren't valuation stretched, further reflected by its Style Score of ""A"" for Value. Shares presently trade at a 10.1X forward earnings multiple, slightly beneath the five-year median and the respective Zacks industry average.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Owens Corning would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Labcorp is a leading healthcare diagnostics company providing comprehensive clinical laboratory services and end-to-end drug development support. The company provides vital information to help doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and patients make clear and confident decisions.Analysts have slashed their earnings expectations for the company, pushing it down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let's take a closer look at a few other company characteristics.Current StandingLabcorp shares have seen rollercoaster-type price action in 2023, up a modest 0.3% on a year-to-date basis and widely lagging behind the general market.The market hasn't reacted well to the company's recent quarterly reports, facing selling pressure regularly.Regarding the most recent quarterly release, Labcorp fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 1.5% but exceeded revenue expectations modestly. Earnings declined 31% from the year-ago period, whereas sales contracted 18% year-over-year. Further, operating income totaled $266 million, down nearly 40% from the comparable period last year due to the notable reduction in COVID-19 testing. Below is a chart illustrating the company's revenue on a quarterly basis.The company is forecasted to witness a growth slowdown in its current year (FY23), likely a reflection of reduced COVID-19 testing. Earnings are forecasted to be down more than 30% on 19% lower revenues in FY23 before returning to growth in FY24.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and a slowdown in COVID-19 testing paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.Labcorp is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Inflation-Proof Consumer Staples Stocks Worth a Watch NowInflationary pressure remains stubbornly high in the United States lately, thanks to a rise in fuel prices. Therefore, investors must closely watch consumer staples stocks such as Mondelez International, Hershey and McCormick &amp; Company as they provide a natural hedge against inflation.Consumer Price Still Running HotPrices of indispensable goods and services continue to move northward. For August, the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.6% month over month and registered its biggest monthly increase in 14 months, per the Labor Department. The CPI climbed 3.7% last month from a year ago.The core CPI also advanced both on a monthly and yearly basis in August. In reality, increases in consumer prices were broad-based as the current rise in oil prices across the globe perked up price pressures. Robust demand for oil amid tighter supply pushed oil prices to this year's highest level (read more: 4 Stocks to Gain as Oil Prices Hit 2023 Highs).The cost of food, shelter, gasoline and airfares increased in August. Additionally, the cost of home furnishing, auto insurance, trucks and cars rose last month.Wholesale Price Scale NorthwardThe recent report on wholesale inflation is similar to consumer prices in August. The producer price index (PPI) increased 0.7% month over month in August and notched its biggest monthly gain in 14 months. The PPI increased 1.6% in August over the past 12 months.The so-called core PPI that generally strips out the volatile energy and food costs also edged up monthly and yearly last month. Nonetheless, wholesale prices that tend to indicate future inflation trends advanced in August, fueled by higher energy costs.Consumer Staples Stocks Act as a Protection Against InflationElevated oil prices leading to a rise in inflation decreases the purchasing power of your dollars. This leads to a drop in consumer outlays, which impacts economic growth and spurs volatility in the stock market.However, investors shouldn't stay away from investing in stocks. Instead, they should bet on companies that are unperturbed by price pressures and their adverse effects on the stock market.Such stocks belong to the consumer staples sector.

Josh Earnest is promoted to Executive Vice President of Communications and Advertising and Terri Fariello is promoted to Executive Vice President of Government Affairs and Global Public Policy. Both will remain on United's Executive Team.""Over the last few years, United has enjoyed a significant competitive advantage by having our policy and communications leaders at the table for every major decision we've made, especially during the extraordinary disruption caused by the pandemic,"" said Scott Kirby, CEO of United. ""That structure only worked because Josh and Terri are professionals at the top of their game. Their counsel and strategic insight will continue to be essential as we implement our ambitious United Next plans.""""Josh and Terri are an integral part of our Executive Team and have helped enable every major action we've taken as an airline these past few years,"" said Brett Hart, President of United. ""They have each transformed and elevated the work of their teams and I know their strategic counsel will continue to make essential contributions to our success.""Josh joined United in 2018 as senior vice president and chief communications officer. He leads the airline's global communications and advertising strategies and serves as the company's chief spokesman.Before joining United, Josh spent two decades in politics and government, including as White House Press Secretary from 2014 to 2017 and as an analyst for NBC News from 2017-2018.Under Josh's direction, United developed a more integrated approach to communications – public relations, social media, advertising, employee engagement and investor and executive communications – that helped drive awareness of the company's leadership during the pandemic as well as industry-first investments in technology, sustainability and the customer experience. The airline has seen a boost in its reputation and overall standing, recently named among Time's Most Influential Companies, Fast Company's Brands That Matter, Fortune's Most Admired Companies, Ad Age's Marketer of the Year and PRWeek's Best In-House Comms Team. Josh's team also launched the airline's first new brand campaign in a decade - Good Leads The Way - which tells the story of United's leadership in areas like customer service, diversity and sustainability, and captures the optimism fueling the airline's large ambitions.Story continuesThroughout his career, Josh has received recognition for leadership in communications, including regularly appearing on PRWeek's annual 'Power List.' His leadership extends into the community too, serving on the board of trustees at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, the board of directors at the Harry S. Truman Library Institute in Missouri and most recently, the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Rice University in Houston.Terri joined United in 2017 as a senior vice president. Based in Washington, D.C., she leads the company's federal, state and international government engagement, including environmental affairs. Before joining United, Terri spent 16 years at Exxon Mobil most recently serving as vice president of their Washington, D.C. office, leading the company's federal and state government affairs.In her time at United, Terri has helped to open and sustain constructive lines of communications with two different Presidential Administrations as well as with state and local leaders on both sides of the aisle. Her team successfully manages geopolitical issues and domestic and international policy proposals that have the potential to impact commercial aviation. She has positioned United as a trusted partner among federal, state and international government officials, and during the pandemic, Terri and her team were instrumental in driving support for the Cares Act. More recently, her team spearheaded efforts at the federal and state levels in support of legislation to further develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.Under Terri's direction, United has set a course to be 100% green by 2050 by reducing greenhouse gas emissions 100% without relying on traditional carbon offsets and has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF – the most of any airline in the world.Terri is regularly recognized for leadership in government relations, including being named to Washingtonian magazine's list of ""Most Powerful Women,"" The Hill's ""Top Lobbyists,"" a top lobbyist by The National Institute for Lobbying &amp; Ethics and as one of the most influential people shaping policy by Washingtonian. Her impact is also felt outside of the industry. She serves on the Board of Directors of Energy Vault, which develops and deploys utility-scale energy storage solutions designed to transform the world's approach to sustainable energy storage. And within the greater Washington, D.C. community, Terri serves on the board of multiple organizations, including the Economic Club of Washington, the Humane Rescue Alliance (where she serves as the Chair of the Board), the Meridian International Center, Ford's Theatre, and the National Archives Foundation.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The Way.

348,06796b06-a121-3d3c-9e8c-a102aba43a25,PNC,2023-09-20,7 Stocks to Sell Based on Unusual Options Activity,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-sell-based-unusual-001536566.html,1694564136,STORY,"['COCO', 'DLR', 'PNC', 'VMW', 'AEO', 'ANF', 'TOL']","[While no participating entity in the capital markets is infallible, retail investors may nevertheless find comfort in targeting opportunities – or exiting from them as is the case here – based on unusual options activity. For this edition, we’ll be exploring stocks to sell based on the rumblings printed by the so-called smart money.To lay the framework for understanding unusual options activity, we must appreciate the concept of implied volatility (IV). Think of IV as the scouting report of a baseball prospect. By itself, a scouting report doesn’t guarantee that the targeted player will pan out. However, it does suggest heightened interest. So, if a team wants to pick up the prospect, it will have to fork over a higher premium.On the other hand, an established star player may command so much value that a team seeking to fill gaps in its organization may want to sell or trade said player. In this case, a team may believe the athlete’s best days are behind him. Understanding the possible motivations behind unusual options activity can help you make data-driven decisions. With that, these may be the stocks to sell based on peculiar derivatives trading dynamics.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVita Coco (COCO)A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.Source: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) does not seem like a natural candidate for stocks to sell for any reason. Since the beginning of the year, shares have more than doubled in value. However, COCO offers an excellent example of letting the data guide your decision-making process.Yes, COCO has performed very well. But recently, in Barchart’s screener for unusual stock options volume, trading volume for puts heavily outweighed calls. To be clear, that by itself doesn’t mean much since selling options generally features the opposite sentiment of buying them. Still, a closer investigation of its volatility smile warrants caution.Story continuesA volatility smile plots IV at various strike prices. Conspicuously for COCO, IV is much higher for the deep in-the-money direction – that is, the lower strike prices – than it is for the far out-the-money (OTM) direction. Technically, it appears that traders are hedging for significant downside risk.In the near term, options flow data – which filters for big block trades likely made by institutions – point to heavy sold call volume. Thus, COCO might be a name to avoid based on unusual options activity.Digital Realty Trust (DLR)A hallway with server racks on either side in a data centerSource: dotshock / ShutterstockAnother entity that seemingly doesn’t appear to rank among stocks to sell, Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is a real estate investment trust that owns, operates, and invests in carrier-neutral data centers across the world. Since the beginning of this year, DLR has gained over 20% of its equity value. And it’s been flying in the trailing six months.However, the unusual options activity in DLR warrants serious caution. Per Fintel, Digital Realty’s volatility smile shows IV spiking higher in the deep ITM direction. In fairness, IV also rises in the far OTM direction too. Nevertheless, the delta in magnitude is gargantuan, possibly indicating that traders are mitigating tail risk (i.e. black swan event).Most problematic in my opinion is that institutional traders appear to have bought $85 puts. Given the high IV of low-strike-price puts, traders are incentivized to sell the puts, not buy them. Think of a terrible organization like the Los Angeles Angels keeping Shohei Ohtani instead of trading him for multiple prospects.In this case, the smart money seems convinced that DLR will fall. Therefore, I’d stay away.Toll Brothers (TOL)Toll Brothers Home construction company logo seen displayed on smart phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAnother top-flight enterprise, homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) presents a more understandable case for stocks to sell. With inflation remaining stubbornly high, fewer folks are able to afford residential real estate. Adding to the misery, the spike in borrowing costs from lifted interest rates imposes affordability woes. Unsurprisingly, TOL incurred unusual options activity.To be sure, Toll Brothers’ volatility smile is quite telling. Yes, IV does rise higher in the extremities of far OTM strike prices. However, in the deep ITM direction, the IV lift is quite conspicuous. While I can’t make any guarantees, it appears that the smart money is protecting against both realistic downside possibilities as well as outright tail risk.Also, what’s truly problematic is that in recent sessions, options flow data shows heavy volume for transactions that have bearish implications. To me what’s alarming is the acquisition of $60 puts with an expiration date of Dec. 15, 2023. These puts have high IV relative to the far OTM options. Thus, the incentive is to sell. That institutional investors are buying the puts suggests a high conviction of incoming downside.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOccupying the gap between a true regional and national bank, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) represents one of the stocks to sell that’s not so surprising to see on this list. Of course, earlier this year, the regional banking crisis sent a shockwave to the system. And questions still linger about broader stability in the sector.Still, when looking at the underlying options dynamic, one can’t help but feel a little bit concerned. For one thing, PNC’s volatility smile shows heightened IV at both ends of the pricing extreme. However, the magnitude of IV is far higher at the lower strike price range compared to the countervailing range. Therefore, you’d expect – all other things being equal – for the smart money to sell options rather than buy them.However, the most recent transaction in PNC’s options flow screener shows an acquisition of puts, specifically the $123 puts which expire on Oct. 6 of this year. That might be a high-conviction negative trade as again, the incentive really is to sell derivative contracts. Thus, PNC should be on your watch list based on unusual options activity.VMware (VMW)The VMWare logo outside of an office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAn American cloud computing and virtualization technology firm, VMware (NYSE:VMW) is an intriguing enterprise. At the same time, the tech sector overall has been rather unpredictable, raising the specter of stocks to sell. However, VMW easily defied gravity, gaining over 35% since the start of the year. In the past 365 days, it’s up almost 40%.Still, it’s not out of the realm of possibility for VMware to suffer a shift in sentiment. Looking at its volatility smile, the underlying IV trend is all over the map. Still, the main takeaway is that IV is generally elevated at the strike price extremes. However, the magnitude of moving toward the deep ITM direction implies risk mitigation among smart money traders.Further, even with IV elevated, institutional investors appear to be buying put options. Specifically, big block trades have been place for $110 puts with an expiration of Jan. 19, 2024. Per Fintel, the IV for this contract is much more elevated than usual at 1.8. Nevertheless, the institutions are buying the puts, not selling them and collecting the premium. It’s possible we could have another high-conviction pessimistic trade, making VMW another one to watch based on unusual options activity.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO)An image of an America Eagle (AEO) store in a mall.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comAt first blush, American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) doesn’t seem like an enterprise to sell. It’s been one of the strong performers recently, with shares up over 24% in the trailing six months. Since the beginning of the year, AEO returned just under 10%. However, the questions about the viability of the consumer economy cast a cloud over the fashion apparel retailer.Turning to its volatility smile, IV gradually rises in the far OTM direction, which is perfectly normal. However, IV veritably skyrockets in the deep ITM direction, posing concerns for would-be speculators in the open market. Basically, it seems that smart money recognizes the extreme volatility risk of AEO. That’s not shocking considering that in the trailing five years, shares tumbled nearly 36%.However, what’s really eye-opening is that throughout this month, options flow data shows significant volume for bought puts at various strike prices. Again, with IV elevated at the extremes, the pros would be incentivized to sell options. Naturally, the buying of puts (an unusual options activity) makes AEO questionable.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF)Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) location with doors open)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPerhaps one of the most intriguing ideas to red flag based on unusual options activity, apparel retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (NYSE:ANF) has enjoyed enormous success this year. Since the beginning of this year, ANF shot up over 126%. In the trailing one-year period, shares returned nearly 222%. At first glance, it’s not the type of idea that belongs on a list of stocks to sell.However, it’s always possible that sentiment can shift, especially as prolonged pressures like inflation weigh on discretionary consumer spending. Still, ANF’s volatility smile offers a fairly wild profile. Toward the far OTM direction, IV peaks at 0.65 at the $80 strike price. On the flip side, toward the deep ITM direction, IV clocks in at 0.75 at the $35 strike.It’s possible that the smart money recognizes both ANF’s upside potential (as evidenced by its strong showing this year) as well as its downside risk. Interestingly, the most recent entry in ANF’s options flow screener was for the sale of $55 calls expiring on Sept. 15. Ultimately, with the security having jumped so high, it might be more prudent to trim exposure.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Other retailers like Macy's (M) and Target (TGT) will also be expanding their holiday workforce. Despite inflation, Wall Street analysts are anticipating a return to more typical consumer spending patterns this year.Yahoo Finance's Josh Scahfer, Brooke DiPalma, and Pras Subramanian discuss various factors employers will be considering this season, including wage increases, labor unionization, and the challenges related to both recruiting and retaining employees.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: All right, guys. My story today is Amazon. I have my eyes on Amazon after they announced how many workers they're planning to hire for the holiday season. So Amazon coming out and saying they plan to hire 250,000 workers, 30 of those seasonal in just California alone. That's up 67% from what they've hired in years past. So obviously, Amazon expecting a big holiday season here. Target also out saying that they expect to hire 100,000 employees. Macy's saying it will hire 38,000 more employees.Obviously, the holiday season just such a big time for these retailers. And it seems, though, the picture is a little bit mixed on what people expect for holiday sales but not necessarily at a company like Amazon. I think Amazon has solidified themselves for the holiday season. No matter what, they're going to get some demand.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. There's lots of takes from Wall Street and whether or not we're going to see an increase in consumer spending or rather a decrease. And one expert that I spoke to said, we'll see a normalization returning to pre-pandemic levels after we saw such an uptick in sales last year, largely due to inflation. That caused those sales to rise.But in addition to that, as you can see here, these companies are largely bulking up. We heard from Target today that they plan to hire this holiday season. Amazon also ramping up its hiring this holiday season. But definitely a mixed picture on how much exactly consumers are going to spend, given all these headwinds that they're up against.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I'm kind of surprised the sheer kind of numbers, right? Is it 100,000 more workers this year compared to last year? Which is sort of a crazy amount. Expecting fewer shoppers or fewer online shopping to happen, but still it's still a big year, adding boosting wages, which is good to see.And I think is it sort of addressing the need that they want-- they need more workers, or is it there's been some unionization efforts at their warehouses, and this is sort of trying to say, OK, we'll give you guys a little bit here, just don't go crazy with the unionization at our warehouses because that's a problem for them?JOSH SCHAFER: The boosting wages is interesting, too, right, to try and get people that are these seasonal workers. Like, how do you win that worker? I feel like we're still talking about this economy-wide right now, with the worker being someone that is still kind of feeling things out and is high in demand for the amount of job openings that we have. You do have to bump up that pay if you are Amazon.And we were talking about yesterday about Meta. Part of that story with Meta, right, is that they want to retain employees. That's why some of the benefits are coming back. You're seeing companies realizing we probably do need to boost wages or we need to give these workers something, especially if they're going to be seasonal workers, right?If they're only coming in for a short period of time, you've got to find a way to win them over compared to someone like Target.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right.JOSH SCHAFER: That's probably the same kind of worker--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Signing bonus, too.BROOKE DIPALMA: Right. And something that I've been covering a lot is Walmart sort of now having this power over that potential worker, whereas we used to see it vice versa, that worker having that ability choosing where they want to go. But now Walmart sort of backtracking entry level positions that now, ultimately, be all the same pay.

Retailers, in general, are forecasted to only hire around 410,000 employees over the coming holiday season, a 15-year low.Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, Inc. SVP and Head of Sales Andrew Challenger attributes the decline in seasonal hiring to labor market forces and inflation pressures.“But, we’re not hearing quite the scramble that we’ve heard the last three years,” Challenger says of tightening hiring trends seen in the early pandemic period.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JOSH LIPTON: Amazon announcing it's hiring 250,000 employees throughout the US. Out of those positions, 30,000 will be across California for seasonal workers. However, according to a recent report by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, it might not be a very jolly holiday season for retail hiring. Amid a cooling labor market, holiday hiring is estimated to be the lowest since the financial crisis. Firms in the sector are only expected to add 410,000 positions in the fourth quarter.So where does this leave retailers as the holiday season approaches? Here to discuss we have Challenger, Gray, &amp; Christmas Senior Vice President Andy Challenger. So Andy, not very jolly. What are the reasons for that?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. We are expecting the retail sector to just hire fewer people than we have the past few years. Part of that is an overall trend. We've saw kind of peak hiring in the retail sector in 2016. And it's been slowly coming down since then, although we saw a spike during COVID.And then we're also expecting the slowing inflation is going to make it difficult for employers to pass on the extra costs of employees on to consumers in the form of increased prices. And it's going to put some crunch on the labor piece of the equation for these companies.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Andrew, let's kind of separate the big retailers that we've been looking at. We talked about Amazon hiring up. Amazon, Walmart, the big box names, so to speak, are kind of the ones where we see the ramp up happen. How do the numbers there you're anticipating compare to years past?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. We are expecting it to be lower this year. Last year, we saw it drop down to about 500,000 jobs added in the holiday hiring spree at the end of the year. That was down significantly from 2001 and to 2020 when we were in the midst of a real labor shortage in the sector. While there has been tightness that's persisted there, we really saw employers didn't need quite as many people last year in a surprising way. And then this year, amid just generally cooling labor market now for a number of months, we expect that to fall even further.JOSH LIPTON: And so Andrew so pending some of this on, I guess, it sounds like the cooling labor market. Also, how much does this really come down to higher interest rates as well? How much did that play into this, do you think?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. I really think that is part of it. When I talk to HR leaders, when I talk to companies, they are feeling the crunch in the people part of the equation of their companies right now. Labor costs have gotten much higher over the last few years. We've been in a real labor shortage. Companies hired at a very quick pace for a period of time.But the labor market has continued to cool in step with a cooling overall economy. We've seen month after month of that now. And while we think it has slowed, the cooling slowed a little bit the last two or three months, we do expect it to pick back up as companies get come to this conclusion that they're not going to be able to pass on all of those extra labor costs to consumers in increased prices.AKIKO FUJITA: So what's the outlook going into what is typically the busiest shopping season of the year?ANDREW CHALLENGER: Yeah. There's still going to be hiring that's happening. 400,000 jobs isn't nothing. And this announcement from Amazon was a big surprise to the upside. Since we put out this report, last year, they had only announced 150,000 people they were trying to hire, so 250,000 is a big increase. There are certainly going to be players there are hiring to their payrolls during the holiday season. They need extra help. Retailers will certainly be doing some extra hiring.But we're not hearing quite the scramble that we heard the last three years with companies offering no interview positions, hearing back from applications within 30 minutes, because it was so competitive. That atmosphere seems to have cooled this season.JOSH LIPTON: All right. Not very jolly. Andrew Challenger, we thank you for your time, sir.ANDREW CHALLENGER: Thanks for having me.]"

Forecasters expect holiday sales to come in at half of last year's rate due to concerns about higher prices.Seasonal hiring is expected to drop to its lowest since 2008, according to researcher Challenger, Gray and Christmas, due to higher costs and weak consumer confidence.Target on Tuesday said it would hire 100,000 employees for the holiday shopping season, flat year over year.

But the real question is, is the stock modestly undervalued? This article aims to provide an insightful valuation analysis of Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) to determine its true worth. Let's delve into the company's finances, operations, and market performance to answer this question.A Glimpse into Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ISRG. Click here to check it out. ISRG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ISRGIntuitive Surgical develops, produces, and markets a robotic system for assisting minimally invasive surgery. It also provides the instrumentation, disposable accessories, and warranty services for the system. The company has placed more than 8,000 da Vinci systems in hospitals worldwide, with nearly 5,000 installations in the U.S. and a growing number in emerging markets. With a stock price of $302.05 and a GF Value of $361.57, the company appears to be modestly undervalued. This valuation sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG): Unearthing the True Value of a Medical InnovatorUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that reflects the intrinsic value of a stock. It takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Intuitive Surgical's stock shows every sign of being modestly undervalued. The stock's current price of $302.05 per share and the market cap of $106.10 billion suggest that the stock is trading below its fair value. This undervaluation implies that the long-term return of Intuitive Surgical's stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical (ISRG): Unearthing the True Value of a Medical InnovatorLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Intuitive Surgical's Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss for investors. To mitigate this risk, investors must review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great ways to understand a company's financial strength. Intuitive Surgical has a cash-to-debt ratio of 10000, which ranks better than 99.88% of 841 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. The overall financial strength of Intuitive Surgical is 10 out of 10, indicating strong financial health.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG): Unearthing the True Value of a Medical InnovatorProfitability and Growth of Intuitive SurgicalCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk to investors. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Intuitive Surgical has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $6.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.99. Its operating margin is 24.34%, which ranks better than 87.85% of 831 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Overall, the profitability of Intuitive Surgical is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Intuitive Surgical's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 61.23% of 730 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.8%, which ranks worse than 53.66% of 738 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Intuitive Surgical's ROIC was 16.91, while its WACC came in at 14.12.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG): Unearthing the True Value of a Medical InnovatorConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) shows every sign of being modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is strong, and its profitability is robust. However, its growth ranks worse than 53.66% of 738 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.

(ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has lost 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, indicating a change of +18.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.45 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues.

Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%.

In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

WRK, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII and REV Group, Inc. REVG.4 Appealing Relative Price Strength Plays for Your PortfolioWall Street has seen a bull run in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 has witnessed an impressive rally, with the index up by around 17%.However, recent weeks have seen heightened volatility and uncertainty in U.S. stock markets. The looming question revolves around the Federal Reserve's future monetary policies, with the September FOMC meeting taking center stage.Most analysts expect the Fed to maintain the fed funds rate between 5.25% and 5.5%, its highest level since March 2021. Consequently, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-FOMC statement holds significance.Given the potential for ongoing volatility, savvy investors looking for equity opportunities should focus on stocks showing signs of relative price strength. Amid this uncertain landscape, identifying promising opportunities is a prudent strategy for navigating the markets.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock's potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it's essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies.

367,9ea0c112-e483-3891-aa17-2017d0716283,WRK,2023-09-20,Can S&P 500 Keep Up Its Winning Momentum? Stock Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-keep-winning-momentum-121000866.html,1695125400,STORY,"['ANET', 'EPAM', 'CEG', 'WRK', 'DPZ']","[The S&amp;P 500 Index, despite enduring a challenging end to the summer, has reached a milestone in resilience in half a decade. For 100 consecutive trading sessions, the benchmark for American equities has managed to avoid a decline of at least 1.5%, per a Bloomberg article, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Although it has logged four losses exceeding 1% in the past two months, daily fluctuations have remained notably soft, suggestive of conditions last observed in 2018. The optimism surrounding the economy's ability to withstand the Fed rate hikes led to the rally. Moreover, the Fed has been less hawkish this year due to cooling inflation. Many analysts are of the view that rates are peaking.A few stocks that have helped the S&amp;P 500 keep up such a winning momentum are WestRock WRK, Arista Networks ANET, EPAM Systems EPAM, Domino's Pizza DPZ and Constellation Energy Corporation CEG.Can the Momentum Continue?On this phenomenon, Thomas Martin, a senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, stated, ""It's unusual, but there haven't been reasons for big drops in the stock market. Unless the Fed really surprises investors this week, there isn't going to be a reason to reposition because we know rate hikes are nearly done,” as quoted on Bloomberg.The road ahead is mixed. The S&amp;P 500 index has gained 16% so far this year. Economists anticipate one more rate hike before the year-end. But rates are likely to be higher for longer. Complications are likely to arise from surging oil prices, which might hit $100 by the year-end (per some analysts). This should put upward pressure on inflation and spoil all calculations of economists and the Fed.The S&amp;P 500's performance in September raises concerns for the rest of the month. Historical data from the Stock Trader's Almanac shows that over the past two decades, the market tends to reach its September peak around the 11th trading day, typically corresponding to a Monday. Therefore, the history for the upcoming few days doesn’t look favorable.Story continuesOn the positive side, corporate earnings should act as a tailwind. There has been a notable improvement in the earnings outlook in recent months, with positive revisions for several key sectors since the start of the second quarter helping offset continued pressure on estimates for others.Estimates for the third quarter of 2023 are holding up much better than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters, per Earnings Trends issued on Sep 13, 2023. Some recently released data points, including retail sales and jobs data, came in at decent, pointing to chances of a continued rally in the S&amp;P 500. Plus, the holiday season is around the corner, which is normally an upbeat period for the stock market.Stock PicksAgainst this backdrop, we have highlighted a few stocks that have facilitated the S&amp;P 500 rally in the past three months. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), indicating that these stocks have further room for growth.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.WestRock – Up 34.2%The Zacks Rank #1 company is a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets.WestRock has the best VGM (Value-Growth-Momentum) score of “A.”Arista Networks – Up 24.1%The Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in providing cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments.Arista Networks has a moderate VGM score of “C.”EPAM Systems – Up 23.2%The Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in providing software product development services, custom application development services, application testing services, application maintenance and support services, infrastructure management services, and enterprise information management services.EPAM Systemshas a moderate VGM score of “C.”Domino's Pizza – Up 22.6%The Zacks Rank #2 company delivers pizzas under the Domino’s Pizza brand.

368,237509ca-5abe-3c86-b887-ad726f9f4fd2,WRK,2023-09-20,4 Appealing Relative Price Strength Plays for Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-appealing-relative-price-strength-114800438.html,1695124080,STORY,"['REVG', 'CAT', 'WRK']","[Wall Street has seen a bull run in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 has witnessed an impressive rally, with the index up by around 17%.However, recent weeks have seen heightened volatility and uncertainty in U.S. stock markets. The looming question revolves around the Federal Reserve's future monetary policies, with the September FOMC meeting taking center stage.Most analysts expect the Fed to maintain the fed funds rate between 5.25% and 5.5%, its highest level since March 2021. Consequently, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's post-FOMC statement holds significance.Given the potential for ongoing volatility, savvy investors looking for equity opportunities should focus on stocks showing signs of relative price strength. Amid this uncertain landscape, identifying promising opportunities is a prudent strategy for navigating the markets.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are the four stocks that made it through the screen:WestRock Company WRK: It is a multinational provider of paper and packaging solutions for consumer and corrugated packaging markets.

370,9e16bdd7-6971-3f4b-81da-cc762f3fedfe,WRK,2023-09-20,Why Fast-paced Mover WestRock (WRK) Is a Great Choice for Value Investors,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fast-paced-mover-westrock-125007199.html,1695041407,STORY,['WRK'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.WestRock (WRK) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 13.8%, the stock of this paper and packaging company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. WRK meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 34.2% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for WRK is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.21. This indicates that the stock moves 21% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that WRK has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped WRK earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, WRK is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. WRK is currently trading at 0.45 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 45 cents for each dollar of sales.So, WRK appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to WRK, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

We'll use ROE to examine CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for CSX How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for CSX is:34% = US$4.1b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.34 in profit.Does CSX Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, CSX has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining CSX's Debt And Its 34% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by CSX, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.47. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course CSX may not be the best stock to buy.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Updated with additional details about the employee and the incident.The rail union representing a carman who was fatally injured while working at a CSX rail yard in Ohio on Sunday is calling for the rail industry to examine its procedures on operating remote-controlled locomotives.The Transportation Communications Union (TCU/IAM) and Brotherhood of Railway Carmen (BRC) identified the CSX employee as Fred Anderson, 56, who worked at CSX for 19 years. He leaves behind a wife and one adult son.“These tragedies are very painful reminders that the work our members perform is dangerous and unforgiving. My deepest condolences go out to the family and coworkers of Brother Anderson, and our union stands ready to assist in any way possible,” TCU/IAM National President Artie Maratea said in a Sunday statement.Maratea said the incident could have involved a remote-controlled locomotive.

A full-scale review of the use and practices around remote-control locomotives is long overdue.

The sector's outlook has been upgraded to positive by the analysts who also revised their ratings for Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) Group and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp.In the first half of 2023, international travel demand surged, driving a robust recovery for the cruise sector post-Covid. This trend significantly boosted cruise stocks with Carnival's stock leaping by 134%, Royal Caribbean witnessing a 110% increase, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings gaining 78%.However, the sector was downgraded to Neutral by Truist analysts in July as the stocks became excessively heated. Since that downgrade, Royal Caribbean's stock dipped by 15%, Carnival's by 23%, and Norwegian's by 25%.Despite these recent losses, Truist analysts now suggest that it might be an opportune time for investors to re-enter the sector. They anticipate strong bookings and pricing trends for 2024 and 2025. The team of analysts led by Patrick Scholes consider the consensus earnings estimates for these years to be overly cautious. They believe that it might not be until December that next year's guidance is provided by the companies.For Royal Caribbean, the analysts have raised their price target from $115 to $137, indicating a potential 43% increase from Monday’s closing price. Even though they have assigned a new Hold rating to Carnival, they view it as a relative underperformer. However, they find it challenging to justify a Sell rating as they expect all players in the sector to benefit from improving conditions. Norwegian Cruise Line stock continues to hold its rating.Last week, Redburn Atlantic analyst Alex Brignall also upgraded both Carnival and Norwegian to Buy from Neutral. He noted that cruise operators have made strides in repaying debt and enhancing profitability.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 8/10Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Royal Caribbean Group the GF Score of 66 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Royal Caribbean Group's BusinessRoyal Caribbean Group, with a market cap of $25.13 billion, operates as the world's second-largest cruise company. It operates 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026. The company's brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea. It also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The company's sales stand at $12.01 billion with an operating margin of 11.4%. However, the company completed the divestiture of its Azamara brand in the first quarter of 2021.Story continuesUnraveling the Future of Royal Caribbean Group (RCL): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownRoyal Caribbean Group's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.91 positions it worse than 85.71% of 567 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.68, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.04 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 6.25, which is worse than 94.76% of 668 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 7.29, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 75.73% of 585 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Royal Caribbean Group seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -12.7 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 72.62% of 767 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Royal Caribbean Group predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of Royal Caribbean Group (RCL): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Royal Caribbean Group has a rich history and a strong market presence, these metrics suggest that it may struggle to maintain its performance in the future. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapRisk Factors of Royal Caribbean GroupHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Royal Caribbean Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.68, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Royal Caribbean Group a hidden gem or a value trap?These indicators suggest that Royal Caribbean Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Snapshot of Royal Caribbean Group's OperationsRoyal Caribbean is the world's second-largest cruise company, operating 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026.

At constant currency, adjusted earnings per share came in at 21 cents. Although revenues came ahead of the consensus estimate, the metric fell 17.4% year over year, driven by lower revenues at most of the segments and brands.Further, the company’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) unit remains sluggish.

Coming to segments, Active Group’s revenues dipped 10.5% year over year, while the metric at Work Group tumbled 15.6% to $117.8 million.

Nautica is available in nearly 1300 freestanding stores and shops globally as well as boasts a sturdy digital presence in more than 30 countries. G-III Apparel will produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products. The company will launch in more than 200 partner doors and build 150 branded shop-in-shops. The jeans will launch in more than 200 partner doors and build 60 branded shop-in-shops.The company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. First deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall. Management has announced a new multi-year license agreement with HanesBrands to manufacture an outerwear collection for the Champion brand. The company will create quality heritage pieces to expand Champions' lifestyle offering. The product will be distributed via its diverse channels across North America and Champions' global network with first deliveries for fall of 2024.With respect to the company’s brand progress, the key brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston are likely to perform well. Expanding the company’s owned brands, including DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin, is a priority as these brands represent an important long-term profit. Also, these brands enable the company to further widen its global reach. In fiscal 2024, with the ownership of the whole Karl Lagerfeld brand, the company’s international sales will be up 20% versus the prior year. Management believes this business can expand to more than $3 billion in annual revenues over time.Story continuesWhat’s More?G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Gross profit jumped 20.9% year over year while the gross margin increased 410 basis points (bps). The wholesale segment’s gross margin was 40.6%, up 440 bps year over year.The company’s results were driven by strength in outerwear and dressier categories including sportswear, dresses and suit separates across its brands DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi's. Strength across denim, footwear and team sports also drove the results. Looking into the third quarter, the company’s order book seems good and inventory is aligned properly. The company is well positioned for the fall and holiday season.For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales to be about $3.30 billion and net income to be $145-$150 million, or between $3.05 per share and $3.15 per share. This compares favorably to net sales of $3.23 billion and a net loss of $(133.1) million, or $(2.79) per share, for fiscal 2023. It expects continued gross margin improvement for the rest of the fiscal year, and projects ending the year with the gross margin being up nearly 450 bps year over year. The second half of fiscal 2024 gross margin will benefit from moderated freight costs.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.Eye These Solid Picks TooSome other top-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank of 1, at present.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Walmart Inc. WMT, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Add as Retail Sales Turn HigherIn August, the U.S. retail sector presented a multifaceted performance. Retail sales for the month exceeded expectations, primarily driven by a sharp increase in gasoline prices, a consequence of production cuts enacted by Saudi Arabia and the OPEC+ alliance. This rise in gasoline prices translated into higher spending at gasoline stations. However, this surge impacted consumers' budgets, particularly as families prepared for the back-to-school season.While there was a notable spike in retail spending on fuel, growth in expenditures on other items remained relatively modest. This suggests that Americans exercised prudence in their spending, possibly in response to the prevailing challenges of rising inflation and increased borrowing costs. Last month, the consumer price index rose 0.6% sequentially and 3.7% from the year-ago period, per the U.S. Department of Labor.A Peek Into Retail Sales NumbersAugust marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. The Commerce Department reported a sequential increase of 0.6% in U.S. retail and food services sales for August, reaching a total of $697.6 billion. This followed a revised reading of a 0.5% increase registered in July. Impressively, August retail sales rose 2.5% from the year-ago period.The Commerce Department's latest report reveals a diverse range of trends in retail sales. Motor vehicle &amp; parts dealers saw a modest increase of 0.3% in sales on a sequential basis. Building material &amp; supplies dealers experienced a slight uptick of 0.1%, while electronics &amp; appliance stores reported a more substantial jump of 0.7%.Story continuesFood &amp; beverage stores posted growth of 0.4%, whereas clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets saw a robust increase of 0.9%. General merchandise stores showed a modest 0.3% uptick, while gasoline stations witnessed a significant surge with a 5.2% increase in receipts. Sales at health &amp; personal care stores rose 0.5%, while food services &amp; drinking places saw a 0.3% increase.However, the picture was less optimistic for furniture and home furnishing stores, where sales decreased 1%. Sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and bookstores reported a more substantial decline, with sales falling 1.6%. Miscellaneous stores also saw a decrease of 1.3%. Interestingly, non-store retailers reported unchanged sales last month, which may have been influenced by Amazon Prime Day sales events in July.4 Prominent PicksYou may invest in Urban Outfitters, Inc..

We will also discuss the recent trends in the crypto market along with the major players in the industry. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most.Will Bitcoin Grow to an All-Time High by 2024?On September 7, Forbes analyzed what the future holds for Bitcoin. According to the report, Bitcoin has witnessed significant price improvements in 2023. After a rough period for the crypto market in 2022, Bitcoin reported a strong comeback in 2023. In July, Bitcoin climbed to $31,000. While the price for one Bitcoin slightly deteriorated to $25,956 on September 13, experts expect a recovery soon. According to the report, Bitcoin seems to be under inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressures forced the Fed to raise interest rates. Such has contributed to a major resistance in the trade of Bitcoin at the price of $28,900. The report informs readers that, as per the Indian government, all transactions of digital assets would be regulated by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). While crypto laws are necessary, stringent regulations may limit the growth of the cryptocurrency market.Despite the turmoil surrounding the current status of Bitcoin, the reports hint at 2024 being a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin halving event is expected in 2024, which brings the hope of a boost in the price of Bitcoin. The halving event takes place every four years. During the halving event, the price reward to Bitcoin miners is cut by 50%. Such helps contract the supply and is a positive sign for Bitcoin's price.Uncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin have been a common trend this year. Stringent regulations in countries and a worsening global macroeconomic condition limit the ability of experts to predict the future of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, experts hold high expectations for the coming year. Take a look at the most valuable currencies in the world.Story continuesWhat Do the New Crypto Regulations Mean?The United States is home to one of the most crypto owners. However, this does not exclude the American market from the wrath of uncertainty and volatility of currencies. On August 25, Reuters reported new crypto regulations introduced by the Biden administration. According to the new tax reporting rules, crypto brokers must report sales and exchanges of all digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The new tax reporting regulations were primarily aimed at countering tax evasion. On the bright side, the new tax regulation makes processing easier for regular crypto taxpayers. The regulation aligns with the administration's efforts to bring in more money from taxes. With the new bill in action, the estimated tax revenue for the next decade is almost $28 billion. To shed light on the importance of tax regulations for the future of the economy, the treasury reported:""This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.""While regulation is a prerequisite for the mass acceptance of crypto or Bitcoin as a mainstream payment method, stringent laws may limit user's willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the new tax regulations can only be judged in the coming months.Are Large Corporations Withdrawing Interest in Crypto?Are large companies with significant stakes in the crypto market distancing themselves from the crypto industry? Is this because of stringent laws or the falling prices of Bitcoin?On August 25, CNBC reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently ended its partnership with Binance. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) will not offer branded Binance cards in Latin America and the Middle East anymore. Users used these cards to purchase commodities directly with their crypto assets. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) also ended its partnership with Binance in July. Such indicates the growing concerns of holding partnerships with companies currently surrounded by intense regulatory scrutiny.However, this does not mean that companies are withdrawing interest crypto as a mainstream payment method. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) still offer a range of crypto cards, allowing people to make hassle-free payments using their crypto assets.Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) offers prepaid cards funded by Tap, Nexo, and Gemini.

Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), spearheading the program, stated:""We believe in payment choice, and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy. As we look toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.""Similarly, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is also making leaps in the crypto market. On September 5, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced it is expanding its stablecoin capabilities.

And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App, to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.""Large corporations investing in the development of crypto is a positive sign for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, crypto-friendly laws are essential to boost crypto ownership and establish crypto as a primary payment method. With that, let's take a look at the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most.20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the MostPhoto by bitcoin executium on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most, we integrated three different metrics. These included the total population from the World Bank, the percentage of the total population that owns cryptocurrencies by Triple A, and the crypto adoption index by Chainanalysis. We considered data as of 2022 for consistency across all our metrics. The crypto adoption index by Chain Analysis is based on five different metrics. These metrics are a combination of the retail value of the cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies at centralized exchanges, and trade volume.We shortlisted the top 50 countries from each of the three data sources. The crypto adoption index and percentage of the total population that owns crypto were given a higher priority. Of the two databases, we chose the first 20 common countries for our list. The figures for the total population were included as reference figures to add credibility to our data.According to our hypothesis, high crypto usage will translate as high bitcoin usage. We have ranked the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most in ascending order.20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most20.

(V) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-visa-inc-130011427.html,1695042011,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of +15.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +12.9% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $32.59 billion and $35.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.2% and +10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $8.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $1.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +2.37%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has demonstrated impressive annual Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth of 20% over the past three years, a metric often used to evaluate a company's performance. Such consistent growth rates are generally seen positively by shareholders, making Amphenol an attractive option for those seeking a more conservative approach.Despite the allure of potential turnaround stories, investment legend Peter Lynch has noted that such risky bets seldom yield benefits. Companies must generate profits to sustain long-term interest from investors. In this regard, Amphenol's profitability plays a crucial role in its business success and investor appeal.Another method of assessing a company's growth is through its revenue and Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margins. Over the past year, Amphenol's EBIT margins have remained relatively stable, reflecting steady operational efficiency. Additionally, the company reported a promising revenue growth of 5.3%, totaling US$13 billion—an undeniable sign of progress.While past performance is important, investors also need to consider future prospects when evaluating a company. In this context, consensus analyst forecasts for future EPS can be useful tools for making informed decisions.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article, Top 5 Unfriendliest Cities in the US.One of the biggest factors behind any city turning unfriendly is tourism gone rouge. It's a negative feedback loop. A city begins to attract tourists in droves. That becomes a problem for the locals. Locals naturally become unfriendly and rude to tourists. Tourists label the locals as unfriendly and rude and the city becomes notorious for its unfriendliness. A study published in the European Journal of Tourism Research found that mass tourism can lead to ""overtourism,"" which can have negative consequences for local residents. Overtourism can put a strain on the local community, as residents may feel irritated by the crowds and the noise. It can also lead to an unnecessary reliance on the tourism industry, which can disrupt local labor structures and community roles.Tourism in the United StatesInternational travel plays a critical role in supporting the economy of the US. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign travelers spent over $233.5 billion in the tourism industry. This injected $640 million into the country every day. In January 2023, travel spending in the US amounted to $14.75 billion, up 64% from January 2022. US travel spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by the end of 2023, up from $1.2 trillion in 2022. By 2026, spending is expected to reach $1.26 trillion. Consequently, the airline industry in the US is currently faring well. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), American airline traffic reached an all-time high in May 2023, with over 81.8 million passengers carried, both domestically and internationally. Major airlines like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are currently dominant players in the US airline market. It is one of the 20 best airlines in the world, with a fleet of over 900 aircraft.  Hotel accommodation establishments across the country have been busy this summer. Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR) reported a 10% increase in revenue in the second quarter in the US, driven by higher occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Marriott  (NASDAQ:MAR) plans to open over 35 new luxury hotels in 2023, and expand their portfolio to over 500 properties worldwide.Story continuesCompanies Ensuring Sustainable Tourism in AmericaIn 2023, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), an American travel technology conglomerate, partnered with the UnTours Foundation and TUI Care Foundation to launch a $10 million fund. Through this fund, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) hopes to help scale sustainable tourism businesses. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), a major US airline, is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. The company has been exploring ways to use more sustainable materials, improve fuel efficiency, and offset its carbon emissions. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has started a trial of reusable cups for in-flight drinks, which will reduce their environmental impact and fulfill their commitment to sustainability.Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the USMethodology We defined the ""unfriendliest cities in the US"" as those where foreign travelers have reported having unpleasant experiences with the locals.To collect information, we conducted a systematic search of relevant Reddit threads, where users recounted their experiences with unfriendly locals in specific cities. The subreddits we included in our search were r/AskAnAmerican, r/AskReddit, r/Damnthatsinteresting, and r/Travel. We used search terms such as ""unfriendliest cities,"" ""unfriendliest citizens,"" ""rudest citizens,"" and ""unhelpful citizens"" to identify relevant threads.To ensure the authenticity and relevance of our research, we identified the unfriendliest cities in the US by analyzing the frequency of mentions of these cities on different Reddit threads and discussions.Below is our complete list of the Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US.  Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US According to Reddit20.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a ...,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-digital-holdings-mara-too-154731372.html,1695138451,STORY,['MARA'],"[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA). The stock, which is currently priced at $9.39, recorded a loss of 4.14% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 5.11%. The stock's fair valuation is $24.57, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MARA. Click here to check it out. MARA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MARAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConsidering the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.28. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company SnapshotMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The Company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The Company's cryptocurrency machines are located in the United States.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapKey Drivers behind Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionWhile Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) might seem like an attractive investment due to its low current price compared to its GF Value, the company's low Altman Z-Score and other risk factors suggest that it might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should think twice and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 13.97% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.62 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.49%. In comparison, the Tools - Handheld industry's yield is 1.03%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.7%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 14.52%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for SNA for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $18.45 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 9.69%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SNA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for KLA:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.39 = US$4.0b ÷ (US$14b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, KLA has an ROCE of 39%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for KLA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for KLA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is KLA's ROCE Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like KLA. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 39% and the business has deployed 133% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Bottom Line On KLA's ROCEKLA has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 385% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching KLA, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The metric, commonly used to measure a firm's profitability and capital utilization efficiency, indicates a promising future for KLA. An upward trend in ROCE, paired with growing capital employment, signifies a business adept at reinvesting its profits at increasing rates of return.The ROCE for KLA is calculated using the formula: Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities). As of the trailing twelve months to June 2023, KLA's ROCE stands at a notable 39%, computed as US$4.0b ÷ (US$14b - US$3.7b). This figure not only represents an exceptional return in absolute terms but also outperforms the semiconductor industry's average of 12%.Over the past five years, KLA's ROCE has remained relatively stable around 39%. Concurrently, the company has augmented its capital deployment into operations by 133%. This consistent high return rate, coupled with significant reinvestment, is a commendable achievement in the corporate sphere. If these trends continue, KLA could potentially become a multi-bagger.Furthermore, KLA's stock performance has been impressive, providing a 385% return over the past five years. These robust returns have surely gratified long-term investors.

(NYSE:VZ) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-120107038.html,1695211267,STORY,['VZ'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:22% = US$22b ÷ US$97b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.22 in profit.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verizon Communications has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 22% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.63. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

He said the odds the DOJ can win its new antitrust case against online search giant Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are better than even.""I think the government has a 50%-plus chance,"" he told Yahoo Finance.Verveer, now 79 years old, sees some parallels in the two antitrust cases nearly 50 years apart. But he also acknowledged there are some new challenges that he and his colleagues didn’t have to face, which will make the task of the current Justice Department more difficult.American Telephone and Telegraph, known for decades as AT&amp;T or ""Ma Bell,"" was the telephone company for decades just as Google essentially is the choice for most Americans navigating the internet.AT&amp;T employed 1 million people and provided local and long-distance phone services for virtually the entire county; its ubiquitous TV ads urged you to ""reach out and touch someone.""The last annual meeting of AT&amp;T before it was broken up in 1984. (Bettmann Archive) (Bettmann via Getty Images)The Justice Department used a proposed lawsuit drafted by Verveer to sue AT&amp;T in 1974, seeking a breakup of its phone service and phone equipment monopolies.It got most of what it wanted in 1984 following a 1982 settlement that created a number of regional companies that eventually became the carriers that currently share the telecommunications market.They include Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) and the current version of AT&amp;T (T).John DeButts, left, and Charles L. Brown, right, led AT&amp;T during efforts by the federal government to break up their empire in the 1970s and early 1980s. (Getty Images) (Bettmann via Getty Images)'That's the American way'The implications of that case are still evident today, even if many Americans aren’t aware. It is the reason that the country’s 307 million smartphone users have essentially one choice to make when they get their phones up and running: designating a wireless provider.The rest of smartphone services — like the web browsing that Google dominates — come pre-installed.The AT&amp;T and Google cases, Verveer said, are ""quite similar"" in that they are what’s known in the legal world as ""vertical foreclosure"" cases. That means they seek to unravel business structures that allegedly abuse control of multiple markets to restrict the flow of competition.Story continuesVerveer began investigating AT&amp;T after a rival phone company called MCI began complaining to the Justice Department that AT&amp;T was a monopoly that needed to be broken apart, according to Steve Coll's book about the case called ""The Deal of the Century.""He concluded in April 1974 that the government had a strong argument and drew up a case for consideration by higher-ups. William Saxbe, a new attorney general working for new President Gerald Ford, gave the go-ahead in November of that year. Ford had become president following the resignation that summer of Richard Nixon.The department handed the case to Verveer, who said he was 30 years old at the time and learned about the filing from a radio news report.""I’m not sure what Bill Saxbe’s personal motivation may have been, but the post-Nixon zeitgeist was distinctly good government,"" he said.Former US Attorney General William Saxbe in his office at the Justice Department in 1974. (UPI/Bettmann Archive/Getty Images) (Bettmann via Getty Images)The judge in the AT&amp;T case, Harold Greene, appeared to find favor with the government's arguments, which may have contributed to the company's willingness to settle. Greene said during the trial that the department had shown ""the Bell System has violated the antitrust laws in a number of ways over a lengthy period of time.""He later said in an oral history that ""I am perfectly content in my own view that the breakup was a good thing. It brought competition into a field where there hadn't been any competition, and that's the American way.""But Carl Hittinger, a partner with BakerHostetler who represented AT&amp;T at the time, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the company should not have been punished for being innovative and figuring out how to link the entire country together.Big monopolistic companies aren't always bad, he added, and a breakup shouldn't be the automatic remedy when anticompetitive conduct is found.Hittinger cited some of the immediate problems that followed the breakup as a reason for caution. It was a period marked by higher residential telephone prices, a decline in the quality of service being provided to American consumers, and confusion about the role certain companies were playing, according to Coll's book.""I think that that kind of thinking sometimes gets carried away,"" Hittinger said. ""And as a result, you end up getting a bad result. That result, it's not good for the public and good for society.""Harold Greene, the federal judge who presided over the AT&amp;T antitrust lawsuit. (Wally McNamee/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) (Wally McNamee via Getty Images)A new legal landscapeVerveer and other antitrust experts said there is significant difference between now and when AT&amp;T was in the government's sights that will make it more difficult for the DOJ to win the Google case. Namely, judges have taken a more limited view of what constitutes anti-competitive behavior.Decades ago, price mattered less as a way to evaluate consumer harm. And violations could be construed by weighing the course of a defendant’s behavior, even if the isolated conduct was legal.The major hurdle that prosecutors now face with Google is the presumption that lower, even free, prices are a consumer advantage and not necessarily anticompetitive. Consumers don't pay Google to search for information on the web, although advertisers do pay to be featured by the company in searches.“[S]earch engines are free, and consequently consumers don’t pay. It is difficult to make an antitrust claim of harm to consumers for a service provided for free,” former US Federal Trade Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth told Yahoo Finance.Prosecutors are trying to get around that hurdle by arguing Google Search isn't truly free for consumers because they enter valuable personal data that Google keeps in exchange for search results.One former FTC attorney, Michael Kades, told Congress in 2020 that ""under current case law, it is arguable that the government could not have successfully pursued its claim that led to the breakup of [AT&amp;T].""Nevertheless, Verveer views the government's case against Google as winnable because he said nearly everyone, including the judge overseeing the trial, understands the significance of internet search and why it matters if Google, or any entity with an alleged 90% of the market, stifles competition.The government's core argument is that Google abuses its power through contracts that secured its search engine as the default on computers and mobile devices, including Apple’s iPhones and computers. These contracts, Verveer said, damage the playing field for other search engines.Google's lawyer, he said, failed to clearly answer a key question last week from Federal District Judge Amit Mehta, who asked if the company was going to show evidence of users who changed the default so they could switch from Google to another search engine.""It was one of those ‘ah ha’ moments,"" he said. ""The answer is probably not good for Google’s defense.""Department of Justice lawyers, including Kenneth Dintzer, center, and Megan Bellshaw, right, arrive at a federal courthouse in Washington last week for the start of the Google antitrust trial. (Nathan Howard/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Google ""paid an awful lot of money to make themselves default and the inertial elements of consumer behavior are strong,"" he added, noting the alleged $10 billion that Google allegedly pays to device and software manufacturers.""Make yourself the default and you’ve probably given yourself a terrific advantage.""Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Strong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Story continuesCurrent Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors’ sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don’t cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

According to MoffettNathanson analysts, these companies are offering substantial promotions for customers, with variations based on the provider and the customer's status - whether they are new or premium rate plan subscribers.Craig Moffett, founder of MoffettNathanson, noted that this year's iPhone promotions are the most generous to date. The top three carriers are offering free iPhone 15 Pro devices or discounts up to $1,000. However, Moffett also indicated that these aggressive promotions do not significantly differ from those offered last year.Data from mobile phone price data firm Navi supports Moffett's claim. The average promotional values this year are similar to those of the previous year. However, AT&amp;T has increased its promotional values for both new and existing customers upgrading their devices compared to last year. In contrast, while Verizon has increased promotional values for those switching to their service, they have decreased benefits for existing customers upgrading their devices.T-Mobile's promotional values for customers switching or upgrading their services are 9% lower than last year. This reduction suggests T-Mobile's confidence in gaining customers without excessive giveaways. On the other hand, AT&amp;T is offering 8% higher promotions for similar customers, indicating a different strategy.Despite these aggressive promotions from the big three carriers, cable companies with wireless operations such as Charter and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Xfinity Mobile are also offering deals. These deals are less attractive than those offered by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, Moffett suggests that these cable companies may still attract some customers away from the big three carriers.MoffettNathanson holds Market Perform ratings for AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile with price targets set at $17, $40, and $172 respectively. On Monday, AT&amp;T stock fell by 1% to $15.08, while Verizon and T-Mobile shares fell by 0.8% to $33.53 and $140.81 respectively. Meanwhile, Charter and Comcast are rated as Outperform with a $665 and $47 price target respectively.Story continuesDespite the high level of promotions in the wireless industry and the gradual decrease in industry unit growth rate, Moffett expressed that this year's promotions do not alleviate these concerns but do not exacerbate them either.Meanwhile, Citi Research analysts do not anticipate these promotions to significantly impact the traditional iPhone launch season or recent market trends. Apple's stock increased by 1.7% to $177.97 on Monday.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This is expected to be October 24, 2023. On that day, Verizon Communications is projected to report earnings of $1.20 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 9.09%.

Whether it’s seeking out stocks with low share prices or solid growth potential, or following the market’s best dividend payers, some strategies come up over and over again.One of these common themes to is to follow the money, that is, to buy into cash-rich stocks. These will bring several advantages to the table, as their deep pockets will help to insulate them against economic shocks and give them the resources to withstand most headwinds. Additionally, many cash-rich stocks are also known for making generous capital returns to shareholders, through combinations of share buybacks and dividend payments.The stock analysts at Goldman Sachs are following this path, and seeing the US economy as currently in a slowdown phase, during which investors traditionally favor a safety-first approach, they have been pointing out deep-pocketed stocks that are offering total returns of at least 11%. These aren’t necessarily the biggest dividend payers – but their combinations of cash reserves, buybacks, and dividend payments give them total returns that will easily beat inflation and provide investors with a ‘place of safety’ as a possible recession looms on the horizon.We’ve opened up the TipRanks database, to pull the details on two of these Goldman picks. Let’s see just what these stocks have to offer and check out the comments from Goldman’s analysts.Tapestry, Inc. (TPR)The first stock we’re looking at, Tapestry, is based in New York. It’s a multinational holding company, and the owner of three well-known names in luxury fashion: Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Tapestry’s brands are operated as independent entities, although they share a common commitment to authenticity, excellence, and innovation. As a luxury retailer, Tapestry has a global reach. The company strives to turn its customer base into an empowered commercial community, and to turn the fashion industry toward sustainability.Story continuesIn August, Tapestry announced it had entered a definitive agreement to acquire Capri Holdings, a firm that, like Tapestry, is a parent company to three luxury fashion brands. The acquisition will bring Capri’s brands, Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors, under the Tapestry umbrella. Tapestry, the acquiring firm, will pay Capri’s shareholders $57 for each share, giving the transaction an approximate value of $8.5 billion.The Capri acquisition bodes well for Tapestry going forward, but in the recently reported fiscal 4Q23, the company missed quarterly expectations even as it completed a strong overall year. The 4Q revenue of $1.62 billion was flat year-over-year, and some $30 million below the forecasts; at the bottom line, EPS of 95 cents was up 20% y/y but was also 1-cent lower than had been expected.For 2023 as a whole, however, Tapestry reported some solid metrics. The full-year diluted EPS, based on a net income of $936 million, was $3.88 – up 22% y/y and a company record. And, during the year, Tapestry returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders.That shareholder return was supported by $791 million free cash flow, compared to $759 million in the prior year. Share repurchases totaled over $700 million in fiscal year 2023, and dividend payments came to more than $283 million. Going into fiscal 2024, the company has raised the quarterly dividend by 17%, to $0.35 quarterly or $1.40 annualized. Tapestry’s total return yield, taking the dividend and buybacks together, comes to ~13%.For Goldman’s Brooke Roach, despite the recent disappointing results, Tapestry’s combination of market position and solid management add up to a stock worth recommending. She writes of TPR, “We acknowledge the several headwinds in the quarter which were larger than our prior expectations (NA -8% Y/Y) as a result of weaker conversion trends for the value-oriented consumer. That said, we are encouraged by TPR’s actions to improve sales trends here, and management’s commentary regarding a significant QTD acceleration (now trending flat Y/Y). We continue to believe that TPR’s DTC positioning, globally diversified operating model, strong brand momentum at Coach, and execution of strategic initiatives will continue to drive relative outperformance against a choppy macro.”Looking ahead, Roach gives the shares a Buy rating and a $46 price target that implies a 50% potential gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Roach’s track record, click here.)Overall, Tapestry’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 17 recent analyst reviews, including 12 Buys and 5 Holds. The average price target stands at $46.81, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 52%. (See Tapestry’s stock forecast.)American International Group (AIG)American International Group, the second Goldman pick we’ll look at, is better known by its initials (and stock ticker), AIG. The company is a leading player in the global insurance industry, offering commercial and retail customers worldwide a full range of insurance products, including property casualty, life, liability, financial, and accident &amp; health policies, along with retirement solutions and other financial services. The business thrust is clear; AIG helps its customers protect their assets through risk management, while providing for future security.The insurance industry is well-known for generating high income, and AIG brought in an after-tax attributable income (AATI) of $1.3 billion in its last quarter, 2Q23. This compared favorably to the $1.1 billion AATI from the previous-year quarter. The resultant adj. EPS of $1.75, was up almost 26% y/y. The company attributed the increase to higher results in the life insurance and retirement segments of the business; a 9% reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding also contributed to the high EPS, which beat the forecasts by 17 cents per share.For return-minded investors, the key point here is that AIG returned some $822 million in capital to its shareholders during the second quarter of this year. The company did this through both a share repurchase policy and a common share dividend. On the first, AIG repurchased $554 million worth of common stock during the quarter; on the second, AIG paid out $268 million in dividends to common shareholders. The common stock dividend, at 36 cents per share, reflected a 12.5% increase in the payment, marking the first dividend increase since 2016. Between the dividend and the effects of share repurchases, AIG returns 11% to investors.The underlying strength of AIG attracted Goldman analyst Alex Scott to this stock. He points out that AIG is likely to continue its solid performance, and writes, “We remain optimistic that AIG will drive ROE expansion through underwriting improvement, greater underwriting leverage, expense reduction, capital management / share repurchases, and net investment income. We increasingly believe that our thesis around the ROE improvement and potential for this company to trade in excess of adjusted BVPS (book value per share) is very real. Ultimately, we think execution on all fronts of the company’s strategy likely yields an ROE more significantly in excess of 10% and with the help of higher interest rates persisting we think the company will get to a 10%+ ROE potentially quicker than we had anticipated.”Putting his stance into quantifiable terms, Scott rates these shares as a Buy, with an $81 price target to suggest 32% share appreciation over the coming year. (To watch Scott’s track record, click here.)Of the 11 recent analyst reviews on record for AIG, 7 are to Buy against 4 Holds – giving the shares a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $70, and a trading price of $61.18, AIG can claim a one-year upside potential of 14%.

Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Strong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Story continuesCurrent Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors’ sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don’t cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.As of Jun 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 were U.S. centers while 353 were located across 11 other countries. In the second quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of 10 new dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired two dialysis centers and opened two dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: DaVita’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and dialysis patient service revenues. An increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments was also seen. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 7.8% north to $7.22.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3 billion, suggesting a 1.9% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are McKesson Corporation MCK, HealthEquity, Inc.

They had surged more than 62% under Bird's leadership, but are still off their 1999 all-time high of 2,433.9 pence.Bird sought to sharpen Pearson's focus to selling directly to consumers and away from traditional educational outlets as the pandemic boosted demand for online learning.He rejected an $8.5-billion takeover approach from Apollo last year.Pearson would compensate Abbosh for leaving Microsoft, including cash and an award of restricted shares equivalent to a maximum of 50,813 Microsoft shares or about 13 million pounds ($16.06 million) at the current price and foreign exchange rates, it said.Abbosh is currently president of Microsoft's Industry Solutions business, following three decades at Accenture in numerous senior leadership roles, including chief strategy officer.""The Company is at an exciting stage of its growth journey in markets that are increasingly digital.

Lumley argues that given the uncertainty surrounding the streaming and linear businesses, Disney is choosing to ""bolster"" a business that tends to be more reliably profitable.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- And Disney will nearly double its investment into its theme parks and cruises over the next decade. The company saying, now plans on investing approximately $60 billion in the business. Theme parks have shown signs of growth at Disney, while its streaming business continues to slow. Shares not loving the news, closing the day in the red. For more, let's bring in Jamie Lumley, Third Bridge Group sector analyst. Jamie, so investors, they saw this headline, they weren't impressed. What did you think about this news.JAMIE LUMLEY: There's definitely a lot to unpack in today's news, and thanks for having me on today. I think what we have been hearing over the last year about Disney is just how much this company is in a period of transition. And if you look at the major headlines over the past few months, you can definitely see that.The streaming business is still not profitable. The linear business is under a lot of pressure. The parks, while seeing some strong international growth, are also not seeing the same foot traffic in the US, and there are a number of concerns about the effect that price hikes have had.So if we look at what Disney is doing today, it's exploring some major transformation initiatives in the linear business, potential asset sales for ABC, strategic partnerships for ESPN. And for the parks business, Bob Iger is really thinking about right now how do we improve this, how do we strengthen this. Yes, the prices have been going up, but if consumers start to see more value in the parks business, in these experiences, can this be an even bigger growth driver for the company going forward.Story continues- Yeah, Jamie, how do we see the two? How do we connect the two here. I mean, you're talking streaming, the losses there. As you point out, there's a lot to be hashed out in terms of a shakedown on the assets Disney owns. The announcement we got today, is that a result of that? Seeing the losses on that side saying, look, our parks business, even if it's slowing down, has been the big revenue driver. Let's double down on that.JAMIE LUMLEY: So if we look at these different business units, I think the overall uncertainty on really whether or not streaming and the traditional linear ecosystem can be, in this transition, to be successful and eventually be a big profit driver for the company, the significance in that uncertainty is making management think, OK, we know that the parks business has historically been profitable, it's still profitable, parks and experiences are driving twice as much operating income as the entertainment division, even though the revenue totals are quite different.Looking at bolstering up that business wealth there's all that uncertainty, is probably top of mind. As we think about looking over at streaming, while there is a lot of excitement about what this can be, we've been hearing from experts that the profitability target of 2024 might not be realistic. It might take another 12 to 18 months beyond that to really see it become profitable.So really bolstering this other side could bring some stability and balance in this business, which is seeing a lot of different pieces moving, and they're trying to find what is the new strategy, to have the traditional Disney flywheel of creating best in class content, content for the family, and then having it be engaged with on a variety of different platforms to ultimately drive success for the business.]"

Akamai is now offering Corero's on-premises DDoS protection to extend Akamai Prolexic, Akamai's own comprehensive portfolio of DDoS security solutions.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)DDoS attacks continue to be one of the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks. According to Corero's threat research, DDoS carpet bombing attacks rose by 300% in 2022, and IPv6-based DDoS attacks increased by 500% during the same period. Similarly, Akamai has observed a record-breaking increase in high packet rate DDoS attacks by cybercriminals, state-sponsored actors, hacktivist groups, and other malicious actors targeting sectors such as financial services, gaming, high tech, and commerce.Prolexic is a cloud-based DDoS protection platform designed to stop attacks before they reach applications, data centers, and internet-facing infrastructure. Now organizations of all sizes that require on-premises DDoS defenses, whether in addition to cloud-based protection or as a stand-alone solution as part of their own network, can leverage Akamai Prolexic On-Prem, which is powered by Corero's SmartWall ONE. The Corero SmartWall ONE solution includes patented mechanisms that accurately detect and automatically stop volumetric and state-exhaustion DDoS attacks to prevent downtime.""As organizations increasingly adopt hybrid workloads, the question of whether to deploy on-premises DDoS protection or subscribe to a cloud DDoS provider is not an 'either-or' choice. The partnership between Corero and Akamai provides a comprehensive approach to DDoS protection, allowing organizations and service providers to rest easy for both their on-premises and cloud-based needs,"" said Corero's Chief Technology Officer, Ashley Stephenson.Story continuesAkamai Prolexic On-Prem, powered by Corero, helps protect against DDoS attacks on-premises and provides customers and mitigators maximum flexibility for use cases where a cloud solution cannot or may not be used exclusively. Akamai Prolexic Hybrid combines cloud-based and on-premises DDoS defenses into a comprehensive solution that offers the lowest possible latencies and minimizes traffic redirection, while providing the security of a massive 20+ Tbps dedicated defense capacity from more than 36 scrubbing centers of the Akamai Prolexic cloud platform.Network services providers, hosting and cloud vendors, and businesses offering SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS can now leverage Akamai Prolexic On-Prem and Hybrid solutions to protect their own environments and provide DDoS protection services to their customers. With Akamai Prolexic On-Prem, the operational costs related to transferring traffic to the cloud can be eliminated for the vast majority of small, fast, and subsaturating attacks, while the cloud-based defenses of Akamai Prolexic defend the network against sophisticated high-volume multi-vector attacks.The new Prolexic Hybrid solution also allows companies to protect data-intense real-time services, like videoconferencing, gaming, voice, or multimedia applications, where low-latency local protection is preferred. The hybrid solution lets organizations bring DDoS defense on-premises while still getting the safety of Prolexic's massive cloud-based defense capacity to defend against large, sustained attacks.""It's no secret that DDoS attacks are becoming bigger and more sophisticated. In just the past two years, seven out of 10 attacks observed were the largest ever mitigated by Akamai, and 65% of attacks we are seeing are highly targeted multi-vector attacks,"" said Sean Lyons, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Infrastructure Security at Akamai. ""Our partnership with Corero allows us to deliver a robust solution while enabling organizations to select the most optimal DDoS solution for their individual use cases whether it be on-demand, always-on, cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment.""Both companies plan to deepen the collaboration further to provide industry-leading infrastructure security solutions by extending seamless cloud signaling, automation, and threat intelligence reporting.To learn more about Akamai and Corero's strategic partnership, visit the Akamai blog.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

The U.S. crude benchmark rose to $91.05 earlier in the session, after reaching $92.43 on Tuesday, its highest since November 2022.London-traded Brent settled at $93.53 a barrel, down 81 cents, 0.9%. The global crude benchmark rose to $94.70 earlier in the day, after a 10-month high of $95.94 on Tuesday.“The closer we get to $100 Brent, the more nervous some traders may get which may show more clearly in momentum indicators,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “And the Fed in particular may have contributed to some of (this)”.Fed holds rates as expected but warns of at least one more hike by year-endThe Fed’s policy-makers, as widely expected, kept interest rates unchanged at their meeting on Wednesday, after 11 previous hikes that added 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25% in February 2022.But they maintained plans to have a rate hike before the end of the year in their bid to bring inflation back to Fed’s long-desired target of 2% per annum from current levels of above 3%.""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate,"" Powell told a news conference after announcing the Fed's latest decision on rates. ""The fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean we have decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we are seeking.""For context, the headline reading for the U.S. Consumer Price Index rose for the second month in a row in August, reaching a year-on-year growth of 3.7% from 3.2% in July.Story continuesThat was largely due to high pump prices of gasoline which accounted for more than half of the increase — a phenomenon that could put renewed pressure on inflation fighters at the Fed. The central bank’s desired inflation remains at a max 2% per year and it has vowed to get there with more rate hikes if necessary.The Fed aside, an interest rate decision in China played out largely as expected. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are also set to decide on interest rates this week.U.S. crude, fuel stockpiles down last weekU.S. stockpiles of crude oil and fuel products fell across the board last week as exports surged and imports fell amid a cutback as well in refining activity as the busy summer driving period ended, the government reported Wednesday.The U.S. crude inventory balance fell by 2.136 million barrels during the week ended Sept. 15, according to the Weekly Petroleum Status Report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA. Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude build of 0.25M barrels instead for last week to add to the 3.955M gain in the prior week to Sept. 8.On the fuels side, the EIA reported a gasoline inventory decline of 0.831M barrels. The forecast consensus had been for a gasoline build of 1.1M barrels that would have added to the prior week’s build of 5.561M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a drop of 2.867M barrels versus the expected gain of 1.05M and the prior week’s rise of 3.931M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.“We had runaway exports of crude versus lower imports last week, that’s basically what it came down to,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital and a regular commentator on the trends and statistics in oil. “Also, refiners seem to have started dialing back a little on runs with the end of the peak summer driving season.”Exports of U.S. crude climbed to a whopping 5.067M barrels per day last week versus the prior week’s 3.09M. Imports averaged 6.5M daily last week, down 1.1M from the previous week. Refineries ran at 91.9% of their operable capacity last week, against a previous rate of more than 93%.The estimated production of crude oil for last week remained at a 3-year high of 12.9 million barrels despite the EIA of late indicating declines in monthly output by U.S. oil drillers in its separately-published drilling productivity reports.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil rally stalls as Fed warns of one more rate hike by year-endRepublican hopeful DeSantis slams EVs, climate ""fear"" in energy speechGold Futures Extend Gains for Fifth Straight Session After Federal Reserve Announcement]"

The consumer-price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, climbed 4.0% in August from the same period last year, surpassing market expectations of a 3.8% increase, according to data released by Statistics Canada on Tuesday. This follows a rise to 3.3% in July.The Bank of Canada had predicted this inflation acceleration due to recent increases in energy prices. Similar trends were seen in U.S. inflation as gas prices rose for the first time since January, reversing a sharp drop in July.On a monthly basis, the CPI rose by 0.4% compared to July, exceeding the consensus expectation of a 0.2% increase. Adjusted for seasonal factors, August's inflation rate saw a 0.6% month-on-month uptick.Year-over-year comparisons have become more challenging as inflation was steadily declining from a high of 8.1% last summer. The latest inflation report is one of two that the central bank will assess before its policy decision scheduled for late October.Earlier this month, the bank decided to keep its benchmark interest rate at 5% after consecutive quarter-point hikes in June and July. Despite signs of an economic slowdown, bank officials remain cautious of ongoing underlying inflationary pressures.Two core inflation measures closely watched by the Bank of Canada, the weighted median and trimmed mean, rose to an average 4.0% from 3.75% in July, according to Statistics Canada. Despite efforts by the bank to bring annual inflation back to its target of 2%, three-month rates of core inflation have remained between 3.5% and 4% for almost a year.Gas prices in Canada saw a significant monthly increase, driven by higher crude oil costs due to production cuts by major oil-producing nations. This led to the year-over-year rise for August. When gasoline is excluded, the CPI rose 4.1% on-year in August, consistent with the previous month.Story continuesFood prices in Canada remain high, although the growth rate slowed to 6.9% annually from 8.5% in July. Consumers paid more for items such as beef and coffee and tea, while prices for fresh fruit, cereal products, and chicken increased at a slower pace.When volatile food and energy prices are excluded, Canada's CPI rose 3.6% in August compared to the same period last year, following a 3.4% increase in July. Housing costs for the month were primarily driven up by rent increases, along with a slight rise in mortgage interest rates. On the other hand, prices for travel-related services saw a year-on-year decline.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Traders anticipate the Federal Reserve's Wednesday policy announcement, leaving benchmark bond yields almost unchanged, just a few basis points short of a 16-year high.The recent surge in oil prices to a 10-month peak and robust economic data exceeding expectations have sparked concerns about potential inflationary pressures. These factors have pushed yields up over the past few weeks. The CME FedWatch tool indicates that markets are almost certain (with a 99% probability) that the Fed will maintain interest rates within the 5.25% to 5.50% range after its meeting on September 20.However, expectations for a 25 basis point rate increase in November, taking the range to 5.50% to 5.75%, have diminished from 41% to 31% over the last week. The 30-day Fed Funds futures suggest that it's unlikely for the central bank to lower its Fed funds rate target back to around 5% before August 2024.Tuesday's economic agenda in the U.S. includes updates on housing starts and building permits. Additionally, the Treasury plans to auction $13 billion worth of 20-year bonds on the same day.Alex Pelle, U.S. economist at Mizuho, emphasized that investors' focus on Wednesday would be directed towards the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and its dot plot of expected interest rates. He highlighted a significant discrepancy between market expectations and the 'dot plot'. According to market pricing, the Fed is expected to eventually restore its policy rate to the 3.75-4.00% range. However, the latest 'dot plot' indicates that the Fed plans to reduce rates to 3.25-3.50% by the end of 2025, and further to 2.5% over an unspecified period.Pelle suggested that these projections underscore the market's sensitivity towards potential growth and inflation risks. He warned that any unexpectedly dovish tone in the SEP or post-meeting press conference could result in a further uptick in long-term rates, considering the current Treasury supply backdrop.Story continuesThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The surge in energy costs, driven by supply cutbacks from Saudi Arabia and Russia, has seen oil prices jump nearly 30% since June, with U.S. crude surpassing $91 a barrel. This increase poses risks as the Fed aims to bring inflation back to its 2% target without sparking an economic downturn.""The run-up in oil prices is at the very tip top of my worries at this point,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. ""Anything over $100 for any length of time and we're going to be very sick.""After raising interest rates by over five percentage points in the past 18 months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are broadly expected to maintain them steady at their two-day meeting beginning today. However, supply shocks such as climbing oil prices present a conundrum for the Fed as they simultaneously fuel inflation and suppress economic growth. This leaves policymakers often unsure about whether to tighten or loosen credit in response.This issue is becoming particularly pertinent now, as the central bank deliberates whether it should increase its benchmark rate once more this year before pausing for an extended period.Traditionally, the Fed has tended to downplay the impact of higher oil prices on inflation, deeming the effect as temporary. This approach is one reason why officials concentrate on core inflation — which excludes volatile food and energy costs — when devising monetary strategy.In August, consumer prices rose by 0.6%, marking the fastest monthly increase in over a year, with higher gasoline costs accounting for more than half of this rise. In contrast, core prices increased by 0.3%.Despite these developments, some believe the Fed will look past this shock. Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist, Ellen Zentner, and her team suggested in a Sept. 13 note to clients that the drag on spending might even be seen as a welcome development, given growth has been stronger than the central bank had anticipated.Story continuesHowever, some Fed observers doubt the impact on inflation will ultimately prove so benign. ""Energy costs are one of the big wild cards that the Fed is facing right now,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) Corp. ""This could cause a significant reversal in headline inflation, forcing the Fed to take more aggressive action than I think investors are focusing on.""Meanwhile, the rise in oil prices adds to an increasing list of emerging headwinds to economic growth. Consumer balance sheets are showing early signs of strain as interest payments consume a larger share of expenditures. The excess savings households accumulated during the pandemic are likely to be depleted this quarter, according to researchers at the San Francisco Fed. A resumption of student loan payments in October will probably also dampen spending.The trajectory of oil prices will largely depend on how high they go. Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., suggested on Sept. 12 that Saudi Arabia would become cautious about pushing prices up further once they exceed $100 a barrel, due to concerns about significantly reducing demand. But fine-tuning the market may not be simple. Even if Saudi Arabia and Russia ease their supply restrictions in early 2024, oil inventories will be critically depleted, leaving prices susceptible to shocks, according to a Sept. 13 report by the International Energy Agency.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This surge in prices is a result of production curbs by Russia and Saudi Arabia leading to a tightening of supplies. Despite concerns over China's economic growth and a sluggish European economy, investors have continued to rally behind the commodity. Last week, U.S. oil prices rose by 3.7% and Brent by 3.6%, both closing Friday at their highest levels since November.Chevron (NYSE:CVX)'s CEO, Mike Wirth, forecasts that crude oil prices will likely reach $100 per barrel, a level not seen in over a year. The dwindling supply and reducing inventories suggest this trend is gradually gaining momentum. Wirth pointed out these factors as indicators of an upward trajectory for oil prices.Nonetheless, Wirth also recognized the potential economic impacts of such high price levels. He warned that $100 oil could potentially slow down both the U.S. and global economies, echoing concerns shared by several market observers.Despite these apprehensions, Wirth underscored that higher oil prices have been prevalent for most of this year and all of last year without triggering the much-discussed recession. He expressed confidence that the fundamental drivers of both the U.S. and global economies remain robust.As for long-term price expectations for oil, Chevron's stance remains consistent despite the market volatility experienced since the pandemic began. Wirth described this period as one marked by unpredictable and fluctuating prices, deviating from what would be considered a midcycle trend.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with JNPR. Click here to check it out. JNPR 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of JNPRJuniper reported strong financial results for the second quarter of the year with total revenue recording 13% year over year growth, exceeding the midpoint of the guidance. The growth in product revenue was even more substantial with a 15% year-over-year increase. These financial figures underscore the increasing demand for Juniper's networking solutions.The company's growth extended across all geographical regions, demonstrating its global presence and market reach. This diversified geographical footprint helps mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations and regulatory changes.Juniper's Mist segment, driven by Mist AI, reported a record quarter with revenue growing nearly 100% year over year. This performance was evident across the portfolio, including wireless, wired and SD-WAN solutions. This strong growth reflects the company's competitive advantage in AI-driven networking solutions and positions it favorably in the market.Further, Juniper's enterprise data center business also performed well, with its Apstra product reporting a record quarter in both revenue and orders. The continuous growth of Apstra, coupled with the increasing adoption of automation-driven data center solutions, bodes well for the company's long-term prospects in the data center market.Story continuesJuniper: The Gem of AI-Driven NetworkingCapturing high-profile accounts and achieving exceptional AI-driven growthOne of the standout achievements for Juniper has been the remarkable growth of its enterprise business. In the last quarter, the segment accounted for more than 45% of the company's total revenue, making it Juniper's largest and fastest-growing vertical for the third consecutive quarter.Enterprise revenue surged by nearly 40% year over year in the the second quarter, illustrating Juniper's ability not only to retain existing customers, but also to expand its customer base. This signifies strong market demand and sets a positive long-term growth trajectory.Further, Juniper's Enterprise business secured marquee AI-driven customers in the second quarter, including Fortune 10 technology companies, Fortune 50 financial institutions and multinational retailers. These high-profile wins not only contribute to immediate revenue growth, but also open doors for future expansion within these prestigious accounts.Strategically, Juniper's focus on AI-powered software automation is paying off.

These success stories demonstrate Juniper's commitment to providing innovative and effective technology solutions to its clients.Juniper: The Gem of AI-Driven NetworkingSource: Earnings presentationWhile Juniper's enterprise business continues to thrive, the cloud and service provider segments faced some challenges recently, primarily related to project timing and order digestion. However, the company remains optimistic about the long-term prospects in the cloud segment, given its strong wide area footprint and the expected growth in demand for AI and large language models. These technologies are likely to drive traffic growth and benefit Juniper's cloud-wide area footprint over time.Additionally, Juniper is concentrating on an attractive opportunity emerging in data center networking, where its custom silicon, congestion management capabilities and support for technologies like RDMA networking position it well to capture market share, especially with major cloud providers. The company has already begun to see success in non-hyperscaler accounts.Financially, Juniper's service provider business performed as expected, but moderated somewhat on both a sequential and year-over-year basis after strong shipments. Despite this, the company sees positive momentum in its cloud metro portfolio, particularly with the new ACX7K platform, which experienced a record quarter in both revenue and orders. The pipeline of opportunities in this segment remains strong, with expectations of it becoming more significant to revenue in 2024 and beyond.Navigating backlog bumps, banking on a 2024 recovery and AI's bright horizonJuniper acknowledges its backlog remains elevated, though it has been gradually declining. As the year progresses, the backlog is expected to continue impacting revenue growth in 2024, albeit to a lesser extent. The company anticipates a recovery in orders next year, driven by strong bookings across all verticals.On the downside, Juniper may face near-term challenges, particularly in the cloud and service provider segments, due to project timing and order digestion. However, the company remains confident in its long-term growth prospects. It aims to deliver improved profitability in 2023 and expects to achieve over 1% operating margin improvement during the year.While the growth in revenue for 2024 is uncertain and depends on the timing of order recovery in the cloud and service provider segments, Juniper remains committed to margin and earnings per share growth next year. The company's diversified business segments, strong customer relationships and continuous innovation in AI-driven solutions position it for long-term success.TakeawayJuniper emerges as a powerhouse in the networking sector with its stellar second-quarter financial results showcasing robust revenue growth, driven predominantly by its product segment. The company's geographical diversification ensures resilience against regional uncertainties and the record-setting performance of its Mist AI-driven segment highlights its competitive edge.With the enterprise segment leading the charge and securing high-profile AI-driven accounts, Juniper's dedication to AI-powered software automation bears significant fruit. Despite challenges in the cloud and service provider segments, the company remains bullish on its future, with its eyes set on a promising 2024 backed by AI's potential and a steadfast commitment to innovation and customer relationships.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds (and other bond options), we believe dividend-paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable, predictable income investors in retirement seek.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.1 per share, with a dividend yield of 78.43%. This compares to the Financial - Mortgage &amp; Related Services industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 15.79%. Check Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Camden (CPT) is paying out a dividend of $1 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.92% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 4.11% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 6.38% over the past year. Check Camden (CPT) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.22 per share, Juniper Networks (JNPR) has a dividend yield of 3.11%. This is compared to the Wireless Equipment industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 4.76%. Check Juniper Networks (JNPR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our introduction to why 3D manufacturing is one of the most important industries today, then check out 5 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.3D printing is one of the most disruptive technologies in the world today. It has allowed companies and enthusiasts to virtually create any product that they like out of thin air, whilst doing so otherwise would require large machines and hefty investments in fabrication equipment. This enables companies to rapidly build out parts and verify their engineering and design even if the fabrication is done only for testing purposes and mass production will take place through traditional machines.3D printers and additive manufacturing as an industry have moved forward quite rapidly over the course of the past decade or so. They are now used to manufacture some of the most complex engineering products in the world, which can withstand significant forces. Industrial equipment and products manufacturer General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)'s Italian division Avio Aero manufactures jet engine turbine blades with 3D printing, and these end up spinning thousands of times in minute at  unimaginable forces inside a jet engine.For the ancient observer, the process of manufacturing a 3D printed jet engine blade would be nothing short of magic. It involves an electron beam welding together thin layers of metal to create a product that is insusceptible to hairline or microscopic cracks. Additionally, since the machines are capable of building robust components, they can also make other components such as sensor housings. Talking numbers, by using 3D printing to manufacture ""tons"" of components for the 787 aircraft, a Boeing supplier believes that the company can save as much as $3 million in costs over the long term.While $3 million in cost savings for a jet that costs hundreds of million of dollars might seem trivial, the fact that there are other methods to fabricate complex products which are fundamentally different from existing processes shows that there is significant room for innovation on the product front and for markets at the supply end. This potential seems to be on the mind of companies as well, since a study from Ernst &amp; Young (EY) shows that out of 900 businesses surveyed in 2016 and 2019 each, the percentage that are applying additive manufacturing technology in their business operations process grew by more than 2.5x while those that did not intend to apply dropped by 3.7x. These are strong numbers for a small time period and the data also reveals that the highest percentage of business that do use 3D manufacturing are in China and South Korea.Story continuesAnother key benefit of 3D printing is the ability to produce simple products cheaply. A variety of goods, such as skateboards, goggles, and even football helmets are made by additive manufacturing. A key advantage of this is that the supply chains for these products can be easily set up domestically in the U.S. and create more jobs since traditionally such goods are imported from Asian countries where the cost of labor and other mass production inputs are lower.However, even though the potential of 3D printing is immense, the fact still remains that printers are not widely used for mass production. Mass production is the backbone of consumerism and capitalism as it allows firms to churn out billions of products each year with ease and improve the standard of living of consumers. One firm that mass produces products with 3D printing is Sonova. It makes hearing aids through additive manufacturing, and the firm claims that the technology has allowed it to produce hundreds of thousands of customized hearing pieces in a year.Finally, any discussion about 3D printing would be incomplete without SpaceX particularly as aerospace is one of the hottest topics in the media these days. SpaceX was one of the first companies to 3D print a rocket engine, as the firm revealed a thruster for its Dragon spacecraft built through additive manufacturing back in 2013. Another rocket company that is quite agile when it comes to blending the latest manufacturing technology in its production process is Relativity Space. The firm is aiming to compete with SpaceX in the crucial area of rocket reusability and it is designing the Terran R medium lift vehicle (equivalent to SpaceX's Falcon 9). This rocket aims to be fully reusable and manufactured by 3D printing.As to what's happening in the printer industry right now, here's what the executives of Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM) had to say during the firm's latest earnings conference call:Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $53.3 million, a very strong 29% growth over the first quarter of 2023. As you’ll recall, we entered the year with a questionable outlook on the demand side as macro pressures with in our industry. And we certainly felt that in the first quarter.There was a continuation of that softness into the start of the second quarter. However, quarter momentum really began to pick up, and we finished the quarter with strength. While there’s still some element of caution in the environment, we’re very encouraged by the recent customer activity that led to our second quarter results. This momentum gives us confidence in the early signs of a recovery and also validates feedback we’ve been receiving from customers that we would see an uptick in orders as we progress through 2023. In combination with this improved customer demand profile in a variety of near-term growth opportunities, we feel very good about the second half of 2023, and we’re reaffirming our 2023 revenue guidance. Meanwhile, the DM team has been laser-focused on something we have full control of, reducing our cost structure.Today we'll look at some top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks and the top picks in this piece are Apollo Global Management, Inc.

According to MoffettNathanson analysts, these companies are offering substantial promotions for customers, with variations based on the provider and the customer's status - whether they are new or premium rate plan subscribers.Craig Moffett, founder of MoffettNathanson, noted that this year's iPhone promotions are the most generous to date. The top three carriers are offering free iPhone 15 Pro devices or discounts up to $1,000. However, Moffett also indicated that these aggressive promotions do not significantly differ from those offered last year.Data from mobile phone price data firm Navi supports Moffett's claim. The average promotional values this year are similar to those of the previous year. However, AT&amp;T has increased its promotional values for both new and existing customers upgrading their devices compared to last year. In contrast, while Verizon has increased promotional values for those switching to their service, they have decreased benefits for existing customers upgrading their devices.T-Mobile's promotional values for customers switching or upgrading their services are 9% lower than last year. This reduction suggests T-Mobile's confidence in gaining customers without excessive giveaways. On the other hand, AT&amp;T is offering 8% higher promotions for similar customers, indicating a different strategy.Despite these aggressive promotions from the big three carriers, cable companies with wireless operations such as Charter and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Xfinity Mobile are also offering deals. These deals are less attractive than those offered by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, Moffett suggests that these cable companies may still attract some customers away from the big three carriers.MoffettNathanson holds Market Perform ratings for AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile with price targets set at $17, $40, and $172 respectively. On Monday, AT&amp;T stock fell by 1% to $15.08, while Verizon and T-Mobile shares fell by 0.8% to $33.53 and $140.81 respectively. Meanwhile, Charter and Comcast are rated as Outperform with a $665 and $47 price target respectively.Story continuesDespite the high level of promotions in the wireless industry and the gradual decrease in industry unit growth rate, Moffett expressed that this year's promotions do not alleviate these concerns but do not exacerbate them either.Meanwhile, Citi Research analysts do not anticipate these promotions to significantly impact the traditional iPhone launch season or recent market trends. Apple's stock increased by 1.7% to $177.97 on Monday.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The difference today, and what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.""Don’t Miss:Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.According to OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais, the IEA's claims could have significant global repercussions.""Such narratives only set the global energy system up to fail spectacularly. It would lead to energy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale, with dire consequences for economies and billions of people across the world,"" al-Ghais said.OPEC argued that the IEA's reasoning on fossil fuels is ""ideologically driven"" instead of fact-based. It also noted that fossil fuels still make up more than 80% of the global energy mix and that they provide ""vital"" energy security for the world.OPEC's statement came on the heels of recent surges in oil prices. If you share this perspective on the enduring importance of fossil fuels, you might want to pay close attention to oil stocks. Here's a look at three that Wall Street finds particularly attractive.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM)Commanding over $450 billion of market capitalization, Exxon Mobil is one of the largest players in the global oil and gas industry.Shares enjoyed huge rallies in 2021 and 2022. And the latest rise in oil prices seems to give the stock more upward momentum: Over the past month, Exxon stock has climbed 8%.The business continues to gush profits and cash flow.According to the latest earnings report, Exxon earned $7.9 billion in profits in the second quarter. It also generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $5 billion of free cash flow.The company is returning cash to investors, too. In the second quarter, Exxon paid $3.7 billion in dividends and spent $4.3 billion on share repurchases.At the current share price, the stock yields 3.1%.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott has an Overweight rating on Exxon and a price target of $124, implying a potential upside of 6%.Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE:DVN)Devon Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations focused onshore in the U.S.In the second quarter, the company's oil production reached an all-time high of 323,000 barrels per day.For the quarter, the company's operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $326 million.""Our disciplined reinvestment rates allowed us to generate free cash flow for the 12th consecutive quarter, and we returned $690 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases,"" Devon CEO Rick Muncrief said in a statement.The company's latest quarterly dividend — to be paid on Sept. 29 — is 49 cents per share. Note that Devon pays a fixed-plus-variable dividend so the amount could change from one quarter to the next.Stifel analyst Derrick Whitfield has a Buy rating on Devon and a price target of $79 — around 49% above where the stock currently sits.Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY)Shares of Occidental Petroleum more than doubled in 2022. The company benefited from elevated oil prices. At the same time, it received more investor attention after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed a sizable stake in it last year.Buffett bought more shares of Occidental in 2023, with Berkshire owning 224.1 million shares of the company at the end of June.In the second quarter, Occidental produced 1.22 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which exceeded the mid-point of its guidance range.Buffett isn't the only one to see potential in the oil giant. Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann has a Buy rating on Occidental and a price target of $80. Because shares currently trade at $66.26, the price target implies a potential upside of 21%.Keep in mind that because of the volatile nature of commodity prices, even the largest oil companies can experience significant fluctuations in their share prices. If you appreciate the generous shareholder returns offered by the oil sector but aren't a fan of such volatility, it might be worth exploring reliable income plays outside the stock market, such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like United Rentals (NYSE:URI). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide United Rentals with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for United Rentals United Rentals' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that United Rentals has managed to grow EPS by 31% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that United Rentals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 28%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of United Rentals' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are United Rentals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of United Rentals, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$133m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is United Rentals Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Rentals' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in United Rentals' continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for United Rentals that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Currently in private preview, the vector store will enable customers to leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) with their proprietary data to get answers that are more accurate than using models which have been trained on public data only. With generative AI and vector store capabilities, customers can interact with MySQL HeatWave in natural language and efficiently search documents in various file formats in HeatWave Lakehouse.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Today's enhancements to MySQL HeatWave are another significant step on our journey to address pressing customer data, analytics, and AI issues,"" said Edward Screven, chief corporate architect, Oracle. ""We've previously added real-time analytics with the best price-performance in the industry, automated machine learning, lakehouse, and multicloud capabilities to HeatWave. Now vector store and generative AI bring the power of LLMs to customers, providing them with an intuitive way to interact with data in their enterprise and get the accurate answers that they need for their business.""For customers looking to perform analytics, transaction processing, machine learning, and generative AI across a variety of data types and sources, additional capabilities have been added to MySQL HeatWave—for both MySQL-compatible and non-MySQL workloads.Generative AI and vector store (private preview)The vector store ingests documents in a variety of formats such as PDF and stores them as embeddings generated via an encoder model. For a given user query, the vector store identifies the most similar documents by performing a similarity search over the stored embeddings and the embedded query. These documents are used to augment the prompt given to the LLM so that it provides a more contextual answer.Story continuesMySQL HeatWave AutoML MySQL HeatWave provides in-database machine learning with a fully automated pipeline for training models. Customers don't need to move data to a separate machine learning service; they can easily and securely apply machine learning training, inference, and explanation to data stored inside MySQL HeatWave. The following new capabilities have been added:Support for HeatWave Lakehouse: Customers can now leverage HeatWave AutoML for training, inference, and explanations on data in object storage in addition to data in the MySQL database—and use a much wider set of data for machine learning.Text column support: Enables customers to perform machine learning tasks - anomaly detection, forecasting, classification, regression, and recommender system - on text columns, further broadening the corpus of data on which customers can leverage HeatWave AutoML.Enhanced recommender system: With support for Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), HeatWave AutoML can now consider both implicit feedback (past purchases, browsing behavior) and explicit feedback (ratings, likes) to generate personalized recommendations. As an example, analysts can predict items a user will like, users who will like a specific item, and ratings items will receive.Training Progress monitor: Customers can now monitor the progress of the model training with HeatWave AutoML, allowing them to better manage resources.MySQL Autopilot MySQL Autopilot is a built-in capability of MySQL HeatWave that uses machine learning-powered automation to help improve performance and scalability without requiring database tuning expertise. It learns from the execution of queries to improve the execution plan of future queries. The latest enhancements to MySQL Autopilot include:MySQL Autopilot indexing (limited availability): Helps customers eliminate the time-consuming tasks of creating optimal indexes for their OLTP workloads and maintaining those over time as workloads evolve. MySQL Autopilot automatically determines the indexes customers should create or drop from their tables to optimize their OLTP throughput, using machine learning to make a prediction based on individual application workloads. In addition, Autopilot indexing predicts the expected improvement with the recommended indexes without creating those indexes and without incurring compute or storage overhead on the users' tenancy.Auto compression: Helps customers determine the optimal compression algorithm for each column, which improves load and query performance with faster data compression and decompression. By reducing memory usage, customers can cut costs by up to 25 percent.Adaptive query execution: Helps customers optimize the execution plan of a query after the query has started to execute, improving the performance of ad hoc queries by up to 25 percent. It uses information obtained from the partial execution of the query to adjust data structures and system resources and then independently optimizes query execution for each HeatWave node based on actual data distribution at run time.Auto load and unload: Autopilot automatically loads the columns being used in an application workload to HeatWave and automatically unload tables that were never or rarely queried. This helps free up memory and reduce costs for customers, without having to manually perform this task.Additional MySQL HeatWave EnhancementsJavaScript support (limited availability): Enables customers to write stored procedures and functions in JavaScript and execute them inside MySQL HeatWave. This makes it easier for developers to write rich application logic in JavaScript and get high performance by executing the program inside the MySQL database. The performance of JavaScript applications is improved since data is not transferred from the database to the client and code is just-in-time (JIT) compiled in the GraalVM runtime.JSON acceleration: Developers and DBAs can now take advantage of HeatWave for real-time analytics on JSON documents stored in the MySQL database, accelerating queries by orders of magnitude.New analytic operators: With support for new analytic operators including CUBE, Hyper Log Log, Qualify, and Table sample, customers can migrate more workloads to MySQL HeatWave.Bulk ingest into MySQL HeatWave: Support for parallel building of index sub-trees while bulk loading data from CSV files helps customers achieve a 10X improvement in data ingestion performance over Amazon Aurora. As a result, data can be queried sooner and the system resources used for loading data are freed up much faster, lowering costs for customers.""The MySQL HeatWave engineering team is clearly doubling down on AI and machine learning innovation,"" said Steve McDowell, principal analyst and founding partner, NAND Research. ""Not only can customers now train ML models on data both in the database and in object storage with full automation, but with the new generative AI and vector store capabilities they'll be able to interact with HeatWave in natural language, and they'll receive accurate answers for their own business purposes only—based on their own enterprise data in addition to publicly available data. The flexibility to use whichever LLMs organizations prefer continues to demonstrate the open and collaborative approach of the MySQL HeatWave engineering team.""MySQL HeatWave is the only cloud service that provides transaction processing, real-time analytics, machine learning, data lake querying, and machine learning-powered automation within a single MySQL database service. A core part of Oracle's distributed cloud strategy, MySQL HeatWave is available natively on OCI and Amazon Web Services, as part of the Oracle Database Service for Azure, and in customers' data centers with OCI Dedicated Region.Additional ResourcesRead the MySQL HeatWave technical blogDiscover the MySQL HeatWave migration programAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

468,c7d67612-3a86-34ae-857a-79591005c6be,ORCL,2023-09-20,Oracle Access Governance Helps Organizations Simplify the Security of Critical Digital Resources,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-access-governance-helps-organizations-120300708.html,1695211380,STORY,['ORCL'],"[New features help customers efficiently manage user access, better protect sensitive information, and address regulatory requirementsCity and County of San Francisco meets user access goals with Oracle Access GovernanceLAS VEGAS, Sept. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle CloudWorld -- Oracle today announced updates to Oracle Access Governance to help IT teams better assign, monitor, and manage user access to applications and other tech resources. This cloud-native service provides detailed visibility into how users interact with tech resources, helping to reduce risk by allowing only authorized users to use, see, or interact with restricted assets such as source code, patents, databases, applications, or infrastructure resources like cloud servers and services.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Providing enough access to legitimate users without exposing sensitive data, applications, or infrastructure to unintended parties is a growing challenge for all organizations. As different users including employees, contractors, customers and suppliers join or change roles, their access must also change. For example, teaching hospitals store personal information about patients that is protected by HIPAA regulations. Medical students do not need access to patient data, but they will require it when they become residents after graduating. Oracle Access Governance can detect the change in status from student to resident and automatically change permissions based on the needs of the new role.These challenges are increasingly important in highly regulated or sensitive industries that handle personal data like financial services, healthcare, and government agencies. The City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), for example, serves more than 4.5 million residents and must ensure their services are always accessible for internal and external users including the public, employees, suppliers, and state agencies. As a government agency that provides essential services, CCSF must provide access to users without compromising sensitive data. CCSF turned to Oracle Access Governance because it is user-friendly and available 24x7. Easy-to-use functions to review access and design assignment workflows help CCSF achieve its identity and access management goals.Story continuesWhen organizations need to manage a handful of applications and users, identity and access teams may be able to manually review and grant each individual access request. But, as organizations grow to 10,000, 100,000 or more users—each requiring access to different resources—the job becomes unmanageable for humans.New Features Help Organizations Manage AccessOracle Access Governance has helped make it easier for organizations to automate identity governance and administration tasks to better manage the access needs for large numbers of users with new features including: Dynamic Access Control: Helps automate the process of managing the identity lifecycle and resource access. It can grant access to thousands of users at once following several common methods—including attribute, role, or policy-based access control—and enables organizations to customize methods to meet their unique needs. It can also automatically grant access through bundles that assign privileges to large groups with granular and customizable control based on corporate policies and identity collections.No-Code Workflow Formation: Helps organizations define the process for access provisioning, reviews, and control without requiring additional IT or development resources. An intuitive, graphical interface makes it easy for organizations to visualize and design access governance processes while integrating tools such as user management and identity collection services into workflows. A well-designed process speeds up access provisioning for both humans and machines.Swift Application Onboarding: Helps organizations provision access to new on-premises and cloud applications with a guided step-by-step process and simplified data loading. A wizard-based system manages user identities centrally and prepares applications for access provisioning by managing and updating information without cumbersome data migrations. Streamlining the connection between application resources and Oracle Access Governance helps organizations better secure personal information about users.""As global environments become increasingly digital and complex, it is becoming more challenging for organizations to efficiently manage user access and protect sensitive information,"" said Pavana Jain, vice president of product management, Oracle Identity and Access Management.

The latest updates include Oracle Celebrate, a first-of-its-kind recognition and rewards offering that helps organizations boost performance, engagement, and retention by providing the workforce insights and capabilities needed to deliver a more personalized, meaningful experience for employees.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Employees are the foundation of any successful organization, and leaders need to ensure that their people feel celebrated and valued or risk losing both talent and productivity,"" said Yvette Cameron, senior vice president, product strategy, Oracle Cloud HCM. ""With Oracle Celebrate, organizations can now leverage a complete, unified employee experience platform that aligns recognition with company values to cultivate a culture of appreciation and recognition, while encouraging more impactful peer-to-peer interactions. These new capabilities make employee recognition easy, meaningful, and inclusive while empowering HR and business leaders to prioritize employee appreciation, boost engagement, and motivate their workforce.""Oracle Celebrate is natively built in Oracle ME, part of Oracle Cloud HCM. This helps HR and business leaders tailor recognition programs to organizational values, naturally embed peer-to-peer recognition in daily workflows, and connect data across the entire employee experience platform to truly understand what is working and what isn't among their workforce. Oracle Celebrate includes:Peer-to-peer recognition: Enables employees and leaders to acknowledge coworkers across the organization when and where it matters most with real-time, contextual, and personal recognition tied to business values. This capability uniquely embeds peer recognition into an employee's daily routine and flow of work, such as weekly pulse surveys, emails, or instant messenger.Generative AI assistant: Enables employees to strengthen peer-to-peer recognition by generating recommended improvements to their submissions. This helps employees quickly create more impactful notes of recognition for their peers across the organization.Nomination and event-based awards: Enables employees to recognize their peers for milestone events, such as work anniversaries and promotions, or for nominations made by peers and managers, such as employee of the month. These features are triggered by updates to employee profiles in Oracle Cloud HCM and encourage workers to recognize peer accomplishments and key moments that matter.Redeemable points: Enables employees to earn points when they are recognized for their efforts by team members. This allows employees to redeem their accrued points for rewards that their organization has created and integrated into the system.Recognition insights dashboard: Enables managers to understand and act on insights that detail what their team is being most recognized for, identify their top contributors, and highlight individuals who may require more attention and support. This allows organizations to help ensure that their entire workforce is recognized for their contributions.Real-time recognition and engagement data: Enables organizations to continuously monitor and update recognition programs with timely and accurate data. This helps administrators measure the effectiveness of recognition and rewards programs by tracking engagement across the entire organization, business groups, and teams, and correlate recognition efforts with business impact such as attrition, engagement, and productivity.Recognition-based social feed: Enables employers to create a real-time stream of organization and team-wide shoutouts and awards. This helps promote camaraderie and provide visibility into daily efforts, shoutouts, and accolades that often go unnoticed.Story continues""The applications and value of recognition are expanding and evolving as organizations rethink how they connect into and uplevel employee success,"" said Zachary Chertok, research manager for employee experience, IDC, ""Building an ecosystem for recognition helps source the roots of achievement, moving the needle on best practices as success happens, stimulating cultural acceptance around process innovation, and building belonging through community acknowledgement and appreciation.""""I think I speak for a lot of organizations when I say it's difficult to create a simple system to ensure employees are receiving the praise and recognition they deserve. This has been a big gap in the HR software market, especially as we all know a strong sense of value and accomplishment is critical to driving employee engagement and workforce efficiency,"" said Ushaan Abeywickrema, director of human resources, MAS Capital. ""We are excited about Oracle Celebrate and its potential to introduce innovative capabilities that revolutionize how we personalize the employee journey. We are hopeful that Oracle Celebrate will help us easily acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our team members all the while reinforcing our commitment to our organizational culture and productivity. We believe that by being recognized for their contributions, our employees will feel more seen, supported, and empowered to be their best selves and deliver their best work.""Natively built for the cloud, Oracle Cloud HCM is a complete solution connecting every HR process from hire to retire across the enterprise with a native employee experience platform. By connecting all employee data on a single platform, HR teams have access to a single source of truth to help inform their people strategy.

An alternative is to consider high-yield stocks to buy.  Investors are beginning to get spooked about inflation. The latest reading on inflation is expected to show that once prices start to rise, it’s really tough to get them back down. Rising oil prices weren’t fully priced into the inflation readings in August. That’s not expected to be the case when the new numbers are released. For some investors who have been reluctantly moving cash off the sidelines, this may be a signal to move back to the relative security of fixed-income investments. You’ll have to make that decision for yourself. However, if you’re looking for stocks to buy, some attractive options exist among high-yield dividend stocks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe companies attached to these stocks are in “evergreen” sectors, which means consistent revenue and earnings. That consistency is a key factor in predicting future stock growth. Here are three high-yield stocks to buy in September 2023.  American Tower (AMT) American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockTwo of the stocks on this list are real estate investment trusts (REITs). These companies are known for offering high-yield dividends. However, that doesn’t always make them a great buy. American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is one exception.  The company is a leading provider of wireless communication infrastructure and does business in 25 countries on six continents. It is a captain of its industry by utilizing 5G, which will continue to be a catalyst for several years.  Growth has slowed a little bit as higher interest rates eat into the economics of new tower construction. However, in the company’s second quarter earnings report, it raised its outlook for capital expenditures. American Tower is also starting to generate revenue from its expansion into the data center market.   Earnings per share are expected to increase by 7.9% in the next 12 months, and analysts give the stock a consensus “Buy” rating with an upside of 30%. Keep in mind that’s on top of a dividend that yields 3.52% and pays out $6.28 per share annually.  Story continuesPublic Storage (PSA) a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is the second REIT to make this list of high-yield stocks to buy. The company’s niche is in self-storage facilities. This was a red-hot sector in 2020 and 2021 when the housing market was on fire.  Not surprisingly, PSA stock soared approximately 130% between March 2020 and April 2022. Since then, interest in the stock has cooled. PSA stock is down about 19% in the last year which is almost a mirror image of the broader market, which is up 19% in the last year. Howeverm that may present a buying opportunity. The company’s revenue and earnings are slowing but still strong. More importantly, they have stabilized at higher levels than pre-2020. That should put a floor on the stock. If the Federal Reserve continues to pause on its interest rate campaign, the company should resume its growth path as the housing market recovers. That would allow investors to refocus on a dividend with a 4.4% yield and an annual payout of $12 per share.Manulife Financial (MFC) The homepage of the Manulife Financial (MFC) website.Source: Shutterstock / chrisdorneyThe insurance industry is another area to look for high-yield stocks to buy. Like many sectors, insurance providers are adjusting to a post-Covid normal. In the case of Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC), that may apply to revenue. That can be explained by the company’s exposure to the commercial real estate market. However, even that troubled area showed a bright spot. The company reported a surge in demand as Mainland China reopened. This led to 26% annualized premium equivalent (APE) year-over-year sales growth.  While revenue is recovering, the company continues to post strong earnings. When you’re looking for high-yield stocks to buy, growing earnings are key. Throughout the next 12 months, earnings are expected to climb 9%, which may justify the 39% projected increase in the MFC stock price. Manulife trades at an attractive valuation of just seven times forward earnings with a dividend that yields 5.86%. On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all edged higher, with the Dow e-minis up 12 points, or 0.03%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis up 3.5 points, or 0.08%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis up by 21.75 points, or 0.14% as of 5:29 a.m. ET.The previous Friday had seen a slump in chipmakers due to concerns of weak demand and bruised mega-cap growth stocks as a result of rising Treasury yields. This led to the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow tumbling between 0.8% and 1.5%, marking their worst single-day fall since August 24.Traders are almost unanimously expecting the Fed to keep rates unchanged at the range of 5.25% to 5.5% at its meeting on Wednesday. The odds for another pause in November stand at 69%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.This expectation comes despite recent hotter-than-expected economic data which has eased recession fears without raising concerns of a September rate hike. However, rising energy prices have emerged as a potential inflation threat, which still remains above the Fed's target of 2%. ""Further rate hikes would risk sending the economy into a hard landing scenario,"" said Thomas Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies.Leading investors like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Janus Henderson Investors anticipate that the central bank will lift its economic growth projections this week but expect rates to have peaked.In other market news, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rebounded 2.4% in premarket trading following Friday's rout, after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"".

Citing positive changes in the semiconductor industry and an uptick in demand, Ho upgraded Micron's stock from Hold to Buy, increasing the price target from $65 to $85. This change suggests a potential 22% rise from the stock's closing price last Friday.Ho's previous neutral stance on Micron was shaped by an oversupply of inventory and weak macro-end demand. However, he now believes that the worst of this downcycle has passed. Factors contributing to this assessment include significant production cuts across suppliers and strengthening demand, particularly in AI servers.A key issue for Micron had been low prices for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), a type of semiconductor memory widely used in desktop computers and smartphones. Ho noted recent robustness in DRAM pricing, which he expects to be sustainable and likely to accelerate over the next two quarters.At the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference held in August, Micron's Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy expressed optimism about pricing trends. He observed a bottoming out of prices and predicted strengthening through the second half of the year, assuming supply discipline is maintained and volume expansion continues.As a result of these positive indicators, Ho forecasts that Micron will provide first-quarter revenue and earnings guidance above current Wall Street forecasts. He also anticipates commentary indicating further improvement in subsequent quarters.

Yahoo Finance Live discusses the reasons for the upgrade.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Deutsche Bank upgraded the computer-memory and storage company from hold to buy. They also raised their price target on the stock to $85 a share. That's up from $65 a share. Brad, this all comes down to pricing for their DRAM chips here. They're improving faster than expected, a lot of that being driven by demand for AI servers and the critical part that their chips play in this. And they think it's going to have a real impact, a material impact here in the coming quarters with that pricing likely accelerating here on out.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. A big DRAM TAM story here for Micron. As you take a look at some of the returns that we've seen over the course of this year, largely mirroring what we've seen within the NASDAQ 100 on a percentage basis. One of the other things being called out, particularly within this report, as well, and this is coming from the analyst Sidney Ho, basically saying, of course, as you were mentioning, the pricing power with semiconductor Direct Random Access Memory-- that's the DRAM that we were talking about a moment ago-- hitting an inflection point.And one particular quote that jumps out, they had a previous neutral stance on Micron driven by levels of excess inventory in the supply chain, weak macro in demand. They now see the worst of the down cycle behind them. So that has given some of the aggressive production cuts by all suppliers, as well as pockets of demand strength, particularly in AI servers, here. So that, particularly going to be interesting to continue to watch for this story with Micron Technology.]"

At the time, Finviz.com said 34 stocks listed in the United States were meeting this specific criteria. Today, it appears there are 38. The previous seven stocks have generally done so-so. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo make my life more complicated, the three stocks to buy for the 2023 edition of the “Brands” portfolio will be completely new names. In addition, if possible, I will try to come up with three companies in three different sectors.At the end of the day, this is more an exercise of fun rather than serious stock selection. However, like all stock selections, quality still matters. I won’t be opting for money-losing businesses, no matter how potentially lucrative. Here’s to the 2023 edition of the “Brands” portfolio.   Stocks to Buy for Investors Building a ‘Brands’ Portfolio: Yum! Brands (YUM)YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is the largest of the three names, with a market cap of $35.5 billion. Owner of the Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Habit Burger brands, Yum has grown to 28,500 restaurants worldwide, generating $15.8 billion in Q2 2023 system sales, excluding currency. Highlights of the second quarter include 13% growth in system sales and a 9% increase in same-store sales. It opened 1,025 net new units in the second quarter. Meanwhile, its operating profit was $573 million in the quarter, 3.4% higher than a year earlier. Its operating margin increased by 10 basis points to 34.0%.The KFC same-store sales were the quarter’s highlight, up 13%, three-fold higher than Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. KFC’s China and U.S. businesses accounted for 40% of its $8.3 billion system sales. The brand’s China system sales increased by 32% due to the removal of pandemic restrictions. In Q2 2023, KFC opened 600 gross new restaurants across 60 countries.  Story continuesKFC exited its Russia business in the second quarter by selling it to Smart Service Ltd. Yum’s free cash flow in the first six months of 2023 was $556 million, 31% higher than a year ago. On an annualized basis, its free cash flow of $1.11 billion is a free cash flow yield of 2.4% [based on enterprise value of $46.6 billion]. While that’s below the 4% yield I usually look for, the strength of its brands makes it a solid buy for the long haul. Fortune Brands Innovations (FBIN)Fortune Brands ground sign at their headquarters in Deerfield, IllinoisSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comI said I wouldn’t include one of my selections from my 2021 article. However, Fortune Brands Innovations (NYSE:FBIN) became the new name of Fortune Brands Home &amp; Security (FBHS) in December 2022 after the company spun off its cabinet business into a separately traded public company, MasterBrand (NYSE:MBC). Fortune Brands shareholders received one share of FBC for every share held in FBHS. FBIN stock is up 14% since the separation, while MBC’s gained 22%. So far, it’s been a winning move by the former FBHS management and board. As for the existing Innovations business, it completed the acquisition of Assa Abloy’s (OTCMKTS:ASAZY) Emtek and Schaub luxury door and cabinet hardware business in June, along with the Swedish company’s U.S. and Canadian Yale and August residential locks business. After tax benefits, Fortune paid $700 million for the business, or about 7.8 times the business’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. However, that multiple is before possible synergies of $90 million at the midpoint of its projections. Fortune expects the business to generate at least $500 million in sales and $0.45 a share in earnings within 36 months. With the addition of the Emtek, Schaub, Yale and August brands, it has some of the strongest names, including Moen, House of Rohl, Thermatru, MasterLock, SentrySafe and more.  It continues to be an excellent long-term buy and one of the best stocks to buy. Tilray Brands (TLRY)In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screenSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY), the embattled Canadian cannabis producer, has had a bit of a resurgence in the past month, at least if you’re judging by its share price. TLRY stock is up more than 26% throughout the past month. It now trades more than $3 for the first time since February. CEO Irwin Simon has taken the company on a buying spree that significantly diversifies its revenues beyond cannabis. Between 2020 and 2022, it acquired five craft beverage brands, including Sweetwater Brewing, for $300 million. The moves put it in ninth spot on the Brewers Association’s 2022 list of beer sales volume in the U.S.Finally, in August, it bought eight craft beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) for $85 million. The brands acquired include Shock Top, Breckenridge Brewery and Redhook Brewing. The deal triples its beer sales volume, vaulting it into fifth or possibly even fourth place on the Brewers Association’s annual ranking by volume. With a “revenue now, more revenue later” business strategy, Tilray is better positioned to deal with the U.S. cannabis regulatory situation.Here in Canada, where I live, it announced on Aug. 18 that it was buying the 57.5% of Truss Beverage Co. that it didn’t already own. Tilray’s purchase gives it complete control over cannabis beverage brands XMG, Mollo, House of Terpenes, and Little Victory. Truss controls approximately 36% of the Canadian cannabis beverage market. It’s another move to solidify its grip on the entire spectrum of products sold in the Canadian cannabis market. While Tilray remains a work in progress, its future is stronger today because of Simon’s moves. This and the other companies we mentioned are all stellar stocks to buy. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.22%.

In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.98 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 11.19%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.56 billion, up 11.72% from the year-ago period.MCD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.52 per share and revenue of $25.46 billion.

The Democratic leader had signed into law a bill to increase wages for fast-food workers across the state.The new AB 1228 legislation, or the Fast Food Franchisor Responsibility Act, will give fast-food employees in California the highest guaranteed base pay in the industry nationwide.“This is a big deal,” Newsom exclaimed during a press conference in Los Angeles on Sept. 28. “What a remarkable moment.”Meanwhile, the National Owners Association (NOA), a group that represents more than 1,000 McDonald’s franchise owners, has slammed the landmark bill for its “draconian” rules.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepareIn addition to the minimum wage increase for fast-food workers, which comes into effect April 1, 2024, the bill also establishes a council that can approve further wage increases in the future.But the NOA has expressed concerns the law would bring on costs that “simply cannot be absorbed by the current business model.”The group claims that 95% of the 1,300 McDonald’s restaurants in California are locally owned and operated by small business owners.“The new AB 1228 legislation has been voted into law and will result in a devastating financial blow to California McDonald’s franchisees at a projected annual cost of $250,000 per McDonald’s restaurant,” the NOA said in a memo obtained by Fox BusinessWhat's in the bill?AB 1228 applies to fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide — except for those that make and sell their own bread. The bill’s landmark change is a minimum wage hike to $20 per hour, almost $5 higher than the Golden State’s minimum wage of $15.50.Story continuesIt would also see the establishment of a Fast Food Council to set wages and make recommendations for working conditions. The council has the power to increase the new minimum wage each year through 2029 up to 3.5% or the average change in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners, whichever is lower.One key part of the bill has been removed since its proposal. Previously, AB 1228 would have made fast-food corporations jointly liable if franchisees committed labor violations, which the NOA believes could have led to “frivolous lawsuits against franchisees” that would then force the larger corporate head offices to exert more control over local operations.“That was a tectonic plate that had to be moved,” Newsom said, referring to what he recalled were the more than 100 hours of negotiations that took place to reach an agreement between industry and labor groups.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howWhat now?In exchange for the dropped attempt to make corporations liable for the misdeeds of franchisees, industry leaders agreed to pull a voter initiative that would have triggered a referendum related to worker wages in 2024, giving way to the wage increases included in the bill.Fast-food workers in California will have to wait until April 1 of next year to reap those benefits in full; however, they may receive a small bump in the new year when the state’s minimum wage for all employees increases to $16 per hour on Jan. 1, 2024.As for the NOA, it has expressed concerns that the passage of the bill could lead to similar efforts by legislative bodies across the country — efforts it says may jeopardize franchisees’ ability to make local business decisions.“We need to remain unified so that this can not gain a foothold anywhere else,” the NOA said, per Fox Business.Editor's note, Sept. 29, 2023: A previous version of this article indicated that AB 1228, when passed by the California Senate, would have made fast-food franchisors jointly liable if franchisees committed labor violations. This was amended out of the bill. Correction: The final quote, previously attributed to Roger Delph, was actually from the NOA.What to read nextWorried about the economy?

484,52443ffa-34e3-3cd5-80eb-0d252b6e3760,MCD,2023-09-20,25 Most Profitable Food Business Ideas,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-profitable-food-business-133900287.html,1695130740,STORY,"['SBUX', 'MCD']","[In this article, we will look at the 25 most profitable food business ideas. You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and head over directly to the 7 Most Profitable Food Business Ideas. The United States food service industry is segmented by service type, outlet, and location. The service type segmentation includes cafes, cloud kitchens, quick service restaurants, and full service restaurants. Outlet segmentation divides restaurants into chained and independent outlets. Location segmentation divides restaurants by leisure, lodging, retail, standalone, and travel. Furthermore, according to Mordor Intelligence, recent market trends in the industry revolve around new product offerings and accessibility. For example, there is an influx of international cuisines such as Korean barbecue. New offerings also take the form of reintroducing old classics. In addition, accessibility trends in the industry are revolving around simplifying the purchase experience through digitization. McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), for example, is building a strong digital platform to simplify access and decrease service time. It's strategy revolves around amplifying contactless channels such as drive-through, and delivery through mobile phone applications.The food service market in the United States is projected to grow at a cumulative average growth rate (CAGR) of 10.03% during the forecast period 2023-2028, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. The market was valued at $834.61 Billion in 2022 and projected to grow to $1.7 trillion by 2028. According to Fortune Business Insights, one of the driving factors of this upward trend in the fast food market growth is the shortage of time to cook meals at home and the growth of fast food chains. The organization also notes that the young population is the major consumer of fast food in the United States, as it is spending more on food outside the home. However, despite a healthy projected growth rate, the quick-service food industry is still grappling with the economic challenges posed by inflation, and macroeconomic uncertainties. This is corroborated by the fact that in the last quarter of 2022, traffic in quick-service restaurants, in general, was comparatively low. The Q4, 2022 traffic was down by 4.2% compared to the same period in 2021. Story continuesMeanwhile, the average price was up by 16.2% in Q4, 2022, compared to Q4, 2021. However, the net sales of quick-service restaurants in quarter 4 of 2022 increased by 6.1% compared to the previous year’s last quarter. Since there is a decrease in traffic, the positive growth rate of sales is fueled by an increase in average check size because of increasing prices. If the traffic continues to fall, the revenue growth rate could decrease.Major players in the industry, such as McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), are also adversely affected by the current economic landscape. McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) recently reported that people are cutting back on its fries, one of the world's most-sold fast food, and one of the greatest contributors to McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)’s revenues. The increase in prices of McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) products and the general rising inflation have made people more conscious of their spending. Customers are responding to economic challenges by ordering more and more value meals and cutting back on fries. The uncertainty of macroeconomic conditions is also affecting the public sentiments on major stocks in the market. One such is Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), which is one of the largest coffee house companies in the United States. The London Company, an investment management company, made the following comments about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter: “Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) – Sentiment on SBUX turned more negative in this uncertain macro environment with the impending return of student loan payments in the U.S. SBUX reported very strong results for the Jan-March quarter, but exercised caution by not raising guidance. SBUX is beginning to realize tailwinds from the re-opening of the Chinese economy, adding a buffer to growth and margins for the remainder of the year.”Our list of the 25 profitable food business ideas does not contain a fine dining restaurant. This is because while a good fine dining restaurant generates substantial revenue, it has low profit margins, which vary from 2% to 6%. We believe that a profitable business should at least have a 9% profit margin, which is what we used as a filter in our list. This article focuses on profitable food business ideas that are either innovative or less capital-intensive to start.25 Most Profitable Food Business IdeasPhoto by Laust Kehlet on UnsplashMethodology We defined profitable businesses with a net margin of at least 9%. Then we looked for profitable food business ideas on public forums such as Quora and Reddit, four (1,2,3,4) authority sources, and one of our own sources: 20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World.  Then, we used trusted sites like Step by Step Business and Fin Model Lab, among others, to determine the average net margin of each business. We also updated the net margins of our previous list of the most profitable food businesses according to our recent research. As tie-breakers, we used their ranking on our sources. 25 - Food TruckProfit Margin - 9%A food truck business gives a higher return on your investment, compared to a brick-and-mortar restaurant. The cost of starting a food truck depends on several factors, including whether you decide to buy or rent a truck. The initial startup cost ranges from $28000 to $115,000. A food truck business naturally also gives you greater mobility in terms of location and events you want to cover. 24 - Donut ShopProfit Margin - 10%Donuts are one of the most popular baked goods in the United States. You can choose to franchise some of the popular donut shops, such as Dunkin Donuts, or set up your own. The Dunikin Donut franchise fee ranges from $40,000 to $90,000, and you must have at least $125,000 in liquid capital. If you do not have the budget to set up a physical restaurant, you can sell your donuts online by establishing a delivery-only restaurant. 23 - BarProfit Margin - 10%While not amongst the most innovative ideas for food business, setting up a Bar is less capital-intensive than setting up a fine dining restaurant. The startup costs vary from $110,000 to $850,000, depending on whether you rent or buy your location. You can also set up themed bars and later expand into dining services. However, setting up a pub or bar will require obtaining an alcohol license. 22 - Juice BarsProfit Margin - 10%Like a Donut shop, you have the choice to either set up your juice bar or buy a franchise of some of the well-known brands. The good news here is that franchise fees of most popular juice bar brands are comparatively lower. Booster Juice, for example, charges a franchise fee of 30,000 dollars.21 - Gourmet CandyProfit Margin - 10%You can run an online gourmet candy shop and sell from your home, which will result in a greater margin.

485,da5fa470-d079-37e3-bbf5-49dc0bf40731,MCD,2023-09-20,Is It Worth Investing in McDonald's (MCD) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-mcdonalds-mcd-based-133006991.html,1695130206,STORY,['MCD'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about McDonald's (MCD).McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MCD a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $11.52.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

487,97dae823-c656-3e0e-a30c-a78aaeeb8b1a,MCD,2023-09-20,Wix.com and Duluth Holdings have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wix-com-duluth-holdings-highlighted-111800161.html,1695035880,STORY,"['WIX', 'DLTH', 'YUMC', 'MCD']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 18, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wix.com Ltd. WIX as the Bull of the Day and Duluth Holdings Inc. DLTH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on McDonald's Corporation MCD, Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ and Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Wix.com Ltd. is bolstering its website-building offerings to help it carve out more market share among professional site designers. Wix has posted blowout bottom-line results over the last year, including a big Q2 beat. Wall Street and developers are also gravitating toward its AI efforts and other new features.The website builder's earnings outlook keeps getting better in an industry that isn't going out of style. In fact, Wix's push to focus on the bottom line helped it report its first-ever quarter of positive GAAP operating income in company history in Q2.Wix is also trading above some key technical levels right now. On top of that, Wix stock still trades 70% below its peaks.Expanding Beyond DIY Wix started helping small businesses and really anyone else design and maintain a website back in 2006. The company offers extremely intuitive and user-friendly tools to help its customers essentially DIY (do-it-yourself)-style build their website through Wix's array of offerings.The company over the last handful of years has raced to introduce far more features to help it attract professional website builders. For instance, Wix in early 2020 launched Editor X, a platform made specifically for designers and agencies. Since then, Wix has rolled out an AI Text Creator and tons of other features. Wix also has partnerships with the likes of Meta, Google, and many others.Wix in July announced its plans to launch its new AI Site Generator, along with a suite of AI-powered capabilities. Even more recently, on August 1, the firm announced its new Wix Studio, which features a ""newly-designed development and creation editor with code capabilities, multi-site management workspaces, and access to new monetization opportunities, all helping to drive efficiency.""Story continuesAll of these efforts are part of Wix's ongoing push to expand beyond DIY to help it tap into new growth areas to help it jumpstart its recently slowing sales.For example, its Partners revenue surged 36% YoY in the second quarter vs. 13% total revenue growth. Wix defines a partner as any agencies and freelancers that build sites or applications for other users as well as revenue generated through B2B partnerships, such as LegalZoom or Vistaprint, and enterprise partners.Growth, Improving Profitability, and Outlook The company grew its revenue by an average of 50% between 2014 and 2018, following its late 2013 IPO. Wix's top-line expansion slowed alongside its sheer size and as it faced more competition and increased saturation in some key markets.Still, Wix posted 28% average sales growth between 2019 and 2021. Wall Street then got worried as its growth slowed in 2022 to the tune of 9% revenue expansion.The slowing YoY growth is somewhat natural as the company grew from around $200 million in sales in FY15 to $1.39 billion last year. The fading top-line expansion, mixed with the end of ultra-low interest rates, forced Wix to start cutting back on costs and focusing on the bottom line and profitable expansion. The company looked to streamline its business, including layoffs that were prevalent throughout the tech industry.Wix said earlier this year that it plans to achieve the 'Rule of 40' in 2025. The idea here is that Wix's combined growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40%.Some of Wix's profitability efforts were spurred by activist investor Starboard, which also pushed Salesforce and others to change course amid the rising interest rate environment, where growth at all costs was no longer valued.Wix crushed our Q2 earnings estimates by 133% in early August, marking its fourth-straight triple-digit beat. More impressively and crucially, Wix last quarter reported its first ever period of positive GAAP operating income in company history.Looking ahead, Zacks estimates call for Wix to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.17 a share to +$3.35 per share in 2023 on the back of 12% higher sales to see it pull in $1.55 billion. The company is then projected to expand its sales by another 12% next year to help boost its bottom line by over 5%.Wix's adjusted earnings outlook had surged since its early August release, up 55% for Q3, 45% for FY23, and 17% for FY24. The recent positivity is part of a long-term upward trend that began at the start of 2022. Its upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Price, Valuation, and MoreWix shares have climbed 450% since its market debut roughly 10 years ago to blow away the Zacks Tech sector's 245%. Despite the run, Wix is now down 14% in the last five years to trade around its Covid-19 selloff lows and roughly 70% beneath its highs.Thankfully, Wix has been on the comeback trail, up 30% over the last 12 months to match Tech. At roughly $95 a share, Wix trades 8% below its early-August highs and 26% under its average Zacks price target.On the technical front, Wix trades above its 50-week moving average again. On top of that, Wix is trading above its 50-day and its 200-day, having completed the golden cross, where the shorted dated trendline climbs back above the long-term trend, near the end of August.On the valuation front, Wix is trading at 3.2X forward 12-month sales. This marks a solid discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 44% value vs. its own historic median. Meanwhile, it is trading at 27.9X forward 12-month earnings to roughly match its industry.Bottom LineWix appears to be taking a ton of the necessary steps to help it run a profitable, growth-minded business for years and years to come.Some of its recent platform rollouts, from AI and beyond, seem to offer substantial near-term and long-term upside. Plus, Wall Street is rather higher on Wix, with 11 of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has coming in at ""Strong Buys"" or ""Buys.""Bear of the Day:Duluth Holdings Inc. is a workwear-centric lifestyle brand that's been hit by slowing consumer spending, forcing it to offer more promotional and clearance sales.Worst still, Duluth shares have fallen around 60% in the last two years. And DLTH is once again trading under some key technical levels after it gave up ground following a recent rally.Duluth Basics Duluth is a lifestyle brand designed for the 'modern, self-reliant American.' The Mount Horeb, Wisconsin-based firm sells quality, solution-based workwear and casual wear, alongside accessories for men and women. Duluth sells everything from rain jackets and vests to flannels and underwear. Duluth also sells supplies such as toolboxes and much more.Duluth posted a nice stretch of growth from its IPO in late 2015 through 2019. DLTH still produced solid top-line expansion after that, but its growth is now fading on both the top and bottom lines.Zacks estimates call for Duluth's revenue to slip 4% this year. Plus, it is projected to tumble from adjusted earnings of +$0.07 a share to a loss of -$0.12 a share this year.Duluth's earnings outlook has tumbled rather quickly, with its current fiscal year estimate down from +$0.06 to -$0.12 since its August 31 earnings release. Meanwhile, its consensus estimates for next year slipped from +$0.20 to +$0.02. Duluth's downward revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Duluth pointed to ""lower average retail and order value due to lower levels of full-price selling and a higher level of promotional and clearance sales"" as part of the reason for its recent weakness.Bottom LineAs I touched on up top, Duluth stock has fallen 60% in the last two years. This is part of an 80% drop during the past five years vs. its Zacks industry's 21% slide.DLTH shares recently slipped right back underneath their 50-day and 200-day moving averages again. Its Textile – Apparel industry is in the bottom 19% of over 250 Zacks industries right now. Therefore, it might be best to stay away from Duluth.Additional content:3 Tempting Restaurant Stocks to Invest In Amid Rising SalesDespite facing inflationary pressures, restaurant sales in August saw an uptick, driven by a rapid rise in menu prices, growth in average checks, and ongoing expansion efforts. This marks the sixth consecutive month of sales growth for the industry. Industry players also reap rewards from their collaborations with delivery services and digital platforms.The industry has been capitalizing on the growth of off-premise sales, which predominantly encompass delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering and meal kits and off-site alternatives like kiosks and food trucks.Sales Increase in AugustPer the U.S. Census Bureau, eating and drinking places recorded total sales of $90.8 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, up 0.3% from July's downward-revised sales volume of $90.5 billion.

489,bcb67db2-2a60-3d4d-bb85-aeb68fb6beb2,PLD,2023-09-20,Plymouth (PLYM) Sells Asset to Up Flexibility & Fund Development,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plymouth-plym-sells-asset-flexibility-144300039.html,1695134580,STORY,"['PLYM', 'PLD', 'PLDGP', 'EGP']","[Plymouth Industrial REIT PLYM recently made a significant move in its portfolio by selling a 306,552-square-foot industrial building located at 6510 West 73rd Street in Chicago for $19.9 million. This strategic sale is expected to have a positive impact on the company's financial health, with net proceeds of $13.9 million after paying off the $5.8 million mortgage secured by the property and other adjustments. The undisclosed owner-user acquiring the property signals the attractiveness of Plymouth's assets to discerning investors.Jeff Witherell, the chief executive officer and co-founder of Plymouth, emphasized the rationale behind this sale, stating, ""We have previously identified a handful of properties across our portfolio that are either in one-off markets where we do not have scale, or the building is not a long-term hold.”According to Witherell, the latest sale to an owner-user matches this, yielding a 4.9% cap rate on in-place net operating income and an internal rate of return of 31.1% over a six-year hold period. Further, he expects that at least one additional disposition will be completed by year-end, which could sell for around $17 million.With this sale, Plymouth Industrial REIT takes a strategic step toward optimizing its portfolio. The move not only bolsters the company's financial position as PLYM intends to pay down outstanding borrowings on its credit facility but also creates room for further investment in its development program.Importantly, as of Jun 30, 2023, Plymouth Industrial REIT had investments in 210 industrial buildings encompassing a total of 34.2 million square feet. The company has actively been pursuing a development program, with three projects totaling 260,322 square feet still in progress.Remarkably, approximately 87% of the expected $23.9 million in development costs have already been funded. The ongoing development projects contribute to portfolio expansion and provide avenues for future revenue generation.Plymouth's leasing activity has also been robust, reflecting its commitment to maintaining high occupancy rates and achieving favorable rental rates. In second-quarter 2023, the company secured leases for a total of 2,103,095 square feet, all with terms of at least six months, resulting in a remarkable 19.3% increase in rental rates on a cash basis, showcasing the strong demand for its industrial properties.Apart from Plymouth’s recent sale strengthening its financial position and paving the way for further investments in its development program, we are encouraged by its strong leasing activity and a promising pipeline of leases, placing Plymouth well for growth in the industrial real estate sector. Investors should keep a close eye on this company as it continues to expand and optimize its portfolio, positioning itself as a key player in the industry.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including Plymouth, Prologis PLD and EastGroup Properties EGP, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Shares of Plymouth, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have risen 6.8% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 1.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrologis carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present.

This follows a series of rate increases aimed at maximizing employment and maintaining inflation at around 2%.In the previous FOMC meeting in July, the Fed raised the key rate after a brief pause, bringing it to its current level. However, recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates an unexpected increase in the unemployment rate to 3.8% in August from 3.5% in July, potentially prompting the Fed to slow or halt further rate hikes.Meanwhile, fresh inflation data released on September 13, 2023, shows that U.S. consumer inflation rose sharply in August by 0.63% from 0.17% in July, with the annual inflation rate accelerating to 3.7% from 3.2%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, fell to 4.35% in August from 4.65% in July.""According to the latest labor report, the Fed is widely expected to hold the key rate hiking at next week's FOMC meeting,"" said Kar Yong Ang, an OctaFX financial market analyst. ""But due to August's mixed inflation data report, the Fed must keep a hawkish tone in its messaging.""While the key rate is expected to remain unchanged at the September meeting, the language used could signal possible future monetary policy tightening. This could potentially impact capital markets and strengthen the U.S. dollar, possibly leading to a rise in USDJPY to the 148.50–149.00 range.In anticipation of the FOMC meeting, the market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with potential consolidation until the Fed's next move. The tech sector's sluggish performance is contributing to this weakness. Despite this, some sectors such as utilities and oil are being closely watched as potential long plays due to their relative strength in a bearish market.Story continuesThe upcoming FOMC meeting is expected to create some volatility in the markets, with traders eagerly awaiting more clarity on the direction of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.99. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.15.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.98. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 5.27. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.26, with a median of 2.79.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.37. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.29.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.02. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 20.75. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 9.95, all within the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ROWE PRICE: NEW REPORT ON WHY RECENT RETIREES WANT TO RETURN TO WORK,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-report-why-143500340.html,1695134100,STORY,['TROW'],"[Millions of retirees returning to part- and full-time work in search of financial and emotional benefitsBALTIMORE, Sept. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, published a report entitled ""Unretiring"": Why Recent Retirees Want to Go Back to Work. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have created an unusually large wave of retirees who have subsequently returned to the workforce, the study found the trend of returning to work in retirement is continuing to grow1. Of those who consider themselves retired, the report shows that 20% work either part- or full- time, while another 7% of respondents reported looking for employment, post pandemic2.The report also noted many retirees return or continue to work due to their retirement lifestyle and for financial reasons. Roughly 48% of those working in retirement felt they needed to work for financial reasons and were mostly from the lower asset thresholds, which included women and single retirees. The report also found 45% chose to work for social and emotional benefits.Key InsightsMany retirees see part-time work as a good transition strategy with 57% of retirees wanting to continue working in some form while 43% would consider stop working all at once.Women and single retirees are more likely than men or married couples to cite income as the primary motivator. Men, in particular, were more likely to cite social connections as motivation to work.Some of the largest financial benefits of additional years of work are delaying retirement account withdrawals and delaying claiming Social Security benefits. At the same time, working in retirement could impact Social Security benefits prior to one's full retirement age (FRA).""Many retirees either choose to work or need work to be included in their retirement lifestyle,"" says Judith Ward, CFP®, a thought leadership director at T. Rowe Price. ""The decision can have many powerful positive effects, not least of which is financial well-being.""Story continuesAlso noted in the report, returning to work doesn't always mean returning to a previous career or work arrangement. Many retirees choose new vocations in retirement and may explore causes or fields that align with their passions and build on their professional experience. Others take advantage of remote work, part-time work, or flexible arrangements to achieve a work-life balance that suits their new life stage.ABOUT T. ROWE PRICEFounded in 1937, T.

It's embracing the mindset that you're deserving, believing in your greatness, and knowing your worth. The contributions made by every Hispanic strengthens the tide of our collective value and creates a beacon of hope and aspiration.

As an immigrant, I would rearrange these as power, progress, and prosperity in a cyclical pattern. Power is not just physical or economic strength, but also the dedication and hard work that sets us on the path to progress. Progress is the advancement-sometimes slow but constant-toward the goal of personal, family, and communal prosperity. Finally, prosperity is the goal of being able to provide for ourselves and others-not just economically, but also socially.

It fuels my determination and commitment to honor them through my contributions and achievements. I seek opportunities to uplift my Latinx community and create positive, lasting impact. The theme stands as a profound recognition and proud celebration of the unyielding grit, greatness, and influence we possess-all of which are propelling the Latinx community forward educationally, economically, politically, and socially.Pedro Sousa, CFA, Risk and Portfolio Construction Research AnalystLiving in Europe has given me a renewed perspective on the interplay of prosperity, power, and progress in our Latin American heritage. We have a history of advanced indigenous civilizations melded with the contributions from various waves of immigration and settlement into Latin America. Importantly, we also have Iberian colonial footprints embedded not only in our surnames, but also in the complex course of events and in our culture.

With its current trading price at $158.01, our DCF model suggests a margin of safety of around 43.03%, indicating that UPS is modestly undervalued. With a business predictability rank of 4, UPS demonstrates high predictability in its operations.Understanding UPS's DCF AnalysisUPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSIn this article, we delve into UPS's DCF analysis, using a data-driven approach to estimate its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow, the EPS without NRI is used as the default for the DCF model, based on research showing that stock prices have historically been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.As of today (September 19, 2023), UPS's intrinsic value calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $277.35. Given its current trading price of $158.01, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 43.03%. Therefore, UPS appears to be modestly undervalued.United Parcel Service Inc: A DCF Value Analysis(Do Not Publish)Understanding the DCF ModelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. During the growth stage, the company experiences faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. The intrinsic value of UPS estimated by the Discounted Earnings model is arrived at by following certain assumptions and steps.TermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$11.53The GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%The appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.37%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10%Years of Growth Stage = 10The growth rate is chosen based on availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4%Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the EPS will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.Growth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=148.85Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10=128.5Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=277.35DCF Intrinsic Value Based on Free Cash FlowGuruFocus also calculates the intrinsic value using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve-month (ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $223.75. This valuation indicates that UPS is Modestly Undervalued, with a margin of safety of 43.03%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LineWhile the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Citi Research Global Head of Transportation Chris Wetherbee says he expects the shipping giant to report ""decent"" results given its ""challenged"" fiscal 2023. FedEx’s Express segment “needs the most help” according to Wetherbee, but their ground and freight have been ""steady performers."" FedEx will benefit this quarter, Wetherbee says, due to “a degree of market share” moving from UPS (UPS) during its negotiations with the Teamsters and Yellow's (YELLQ) bankruptcy.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Another big story that we're watching-- FedEx earnings, the logistics giant, is reporting results for its first quarter on Wednesday. Now, according to Bloomberg street consensus is for revenue of $21.85 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share. Now, many analysts including our next guest remain optimistic ahead of the earnings release. You can see 19 analysts have buy ratings on the stock, 15 hold and just 1 sell. We want to bring in Chris Wetherbee, Citi Research global head of the Transportation sector. Chris, it's great to see you here. So lots of anticipation going into this report here that we're going to get from FedEx later this week. What do you expect we'll hear from the company?CHRIS WETHERBEE: Well, we think the company is actually going to report a relatively decent fiscal first quarter. Now, you have to remember where FedEx is coming from. It had a very challenged fiscal '23 really starting about a year ago in the fall of last year when global trade deceleration really hurt their biggest business which is their Express segment.We think a lot of that is behind us at this point. We're beginning to see some relative improvement off of what's a very low level. So in terms of earnings for the quarter, we're looking for about $4 a share, so we're a bit above consensus. And we think ultimately we're going to see OK results from Express but probably pretty good results from ground and then their freight segment which is LTL trucking.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: Is there any significance in UPS just kind of getting through and announcing their newly ratified contract just last week making sure that they've also got their logistics house in order, if you will. At the same time that FedEx, of course, different classification for their worker types, but at the same time, they have been going out it sounds like to customers and saying, hey, look at the issues that UPS is having. Now with those kind of in the rear view mirror, does that change the equation for taking on even more large contracts?CHRIS WETHERBEE: I do think one of the things that we'll see in FedEx is fiscal first quarter is a degree of market share that moved from UPS to FedEx. Remember, FedEx's quarter was through the end of August, and UPS was going through those contract negotiations really over the course of June and July in a very sort of hot and heavy way. And so we do think there's a relatively large amount of shippers who move some degree of volume over to FedEx.So UPS has talked about a million packages per day of diversion about a third of that going to FedEx. That'll show up in FedEx ground business, and that's part of the reason why we would expect the ground segment to report a relatively strong result. Now that's not something that necessarily can last to the same degree, the same amount of strength throughout the year. We do think that some of those customers will transition back to UPS. But in the short run, it definitely is a tailwind for FedEx as they were open for business. And I think there was some concern from customers that you could see a work stoppage at UPS, and so some risk taking off the table by moving over to FedEx.SEANA SMITH: Chris, do you see that for the bankruptcy of Yellow that we saw in August, just in terms of the fact that they could potentially win a little bit more of market share there at least over the coming months?CHRIS WETHERBEE: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So Yellow going out of business during FedEx's fiscal first quarter as well is going to be another tailwind. Now that has the potential to stick around for the rest of the fiscal year and really ongoing because the doors are closed at Yellow. So FedEx being the largest LTL company in the country should benefit decently from not only just shipments moving over from Yellow to FedEx but also pricing, which was strong to begin with in the LTL business but actually probably getting stronger as a result of reduced capacity.Remember, Yellow was about 6.5% of overall shipments in the market and a little bit bigger number than that in terms of revenue. And so that capacity coming out should really tighten up the LTL market benefiting pricing, and obviously, they're getting their fair share of volume moving over to.BRAD SMITH: Chris, you've got a new CFO at FedEx. Now, what should investors, what should viewers who are tracking this ticker every single day, what should they keep an eye on with regard to his own track record? I believe this is John Dietrich who is going to be taking over at this role. What should they be watching for in that type of financial leadership style and how that could perhaps flow through to some of the price action as well?CHRIS WETHERBEE: So I think the addition of a new CFO is a good thing ultimately for FedEx. And I think what you're seeing here is you're bringing in an executive who's got a strong background in global air cargo market. And that again, kind of ties into FedEx's biggest business, which is the Express segment. I think that ultimately is an area where they need probably the most help. So ground and freight have been generally steady performers over the course of the last several years where Express has had significant volatility both up and during the pandemic and then down post pandemic.And so getting a degree of stability and bringing in an executive who's got a strong track record executing in this global air cargo market I think goes a long way. Ultimately, the sort of better financial discipline to improve the company's results as well as focus on CapEx and return on invested capital are some of the things that investors are really focused on with the company like FedEx. I think is going to be a positive, so we're excited about that.BRAD SMITH: All right, Chris Wetherbee, who is the Citi Research global head of the Transportation sector. Chris, thanks for taking the time here this morning. Certainly appreciate it.CHRIS WETHERBEE: Thank you.]"

The average beat is 9.51%.FedEx Corporation Price and EPS Surprise FedEx Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseFedEx Corporation price-eps-surprise | FedEx Corporation Quote Given this backdrop, let's examine the factors likely to have influenced FedEx’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Like the past few quarters, we believe lackluster shipping demand will likely hurt FedEx’s performance in first-quarter fiscal 2024. The performance of the Express unit, FDX's largest segment, is likely to have been severely hurt due to the demand-induced volume weakness.  We expect revenues from the Express unit to be down 10.9% from the first-quarter fiscal 2023 actuals.To navigate the weaker-than-expected business environment, FDX is cutting costs. We expect total operating expenses (adjusted) to decline 6.6% from the year-ago actuals, driven by its cost-saving plan. FDX’s cost-cutting efforts are likely to have aided the company’s bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share has been revised 0.5% upward in the past 60 days.What Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for FedEx this time around.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.Stock markets displayed volatility as traders prepared for the possibility of a hawkish message from major central banks convening this week to determine interest rates. Brent crude oil, a benchmark, surged beyond $95 per barrel, marking its highest level since November, raising worries about inflation. Oil industry giants such as TotalEnergies SE, BP Plc, and Shell Plc significantly influenced gains in Europe's Stoxx 600 benchmark index. In the United States, equity futures showed minimal movement. On the Chinese stocks front, BlackRock Strategists have revised their stance on Chinese stocks, downgrading them from overweight to neutral. This decision was influenced by concerns surrounding China's property sector and the belief that stimulus measures have not provided the anticipated boost. In a report published on September 18, the strategists, led by Jean Boivin, highlighted reasons for this downgrade, citing a slowdown in growth, less substantial policy stimulus compared to previous instances, ongoing structural challenges indicating deteriorating long-term growth, and the persistence of geopolitical risks.Across Europe, investor caution arose as the euro area's 10-year Bund yield surged to a 12-year high, reported Reuters. European Central Bank officials reiterated their commitment to stabilizing rates to control inflation. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a central ECB policymaker, emphasized maintaining rates at 4%, countering calls for higher rates. Market sentiment was cautious, with investors hesitating to invest despite expectations of interest rates peaking. Bund yields, currently at 2.70%, stabilized after recent selling pressure. The Federal Reserve's impending policy meeting, with expectations of a 25-basis-point rate hike, remained a focal point. Rising oil prices raised concerns of slowing disinflation, affecting bond prices. Italy's 10-year bond yield was at 4.50%, and the spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, indicating investor confidence, stood at 179 basis points. ECB policy hawks suggested ending bond reinvestments under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme earlier than the 2024 deadline, potentially impacting peripheral bond prices and monetary policy transmission. Markets remained cautious, monitoring central bank decisions and bond yield developments.Story continuesOn the precious metal side, gold prices held near two-week highs as the U.S. dollar retreated from a six-month peak, with central bank meetings in focus. Spot gold saw a slight 0.1% dip to $1,930.39 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures edged down 0.1% to $1,951.60. The dollar's decline made gold more attractive to foreign buyers ahead of key central bank decisions by the U.S., UK, and Japan. While the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged, it focuses on its future rate outlook. Fed Chair Powell will likely emphasize ongoing inflation risks but a wait-and-see approach. However, continued rate hikes to control inflation could dampen gold's appeal. In other metals, spot silver fell 0.2% to $23.18 per ounce, platinum eased 0.3% to $930.15, and palladium rose 0.5% to $1,242.01.In financial markets, notable equities such as OceanFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:OCFC) and PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTCT) have received downgrades from analysts among many other companies.

PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.01 (-0.13%)Established in 1999, the company is based in Irving, Texas. PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) and its subsidiaries offer omni-channel commerce solutions in multiple countries, including the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, and India. Their services encompass order-to-cash processing, order fulfillment, and contact center support. The latter includes essential services like order entry, returns authorization, product inquiries, and order tracking. They also provide the iCommerce Agent application, enabling agents to assist customers with various functions such as placing orders, checking order status, facilitating returns, upselling, cross-selling, managing escalations, and gathering customer feedback. PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) serves clients across diverse industries, including health, skincare, fragrance, cosmetics, fashion, luxury goods, consumer packaged goods, collectibles, jewelry, housewares, electronics, and more.On September 18, Craig-Hallum analyst George Sutton revised the rating for PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW), downgrading it from ""Buy"" to ""Hold."" In conjunction with this adjustment, he also reduced the price target for PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) from $11 to $7.50. These decisions had an immediate impact, with PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW) stock price experiencing a marginal decline of 0.1%, settling at $7.43.09. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.21 (-0.60%)On September 18, Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) was downgraded by Desjardins from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" with a current stock price of $34.88, reflecting a decrease of 0.6%. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) is being downgraded due to limited return potential to the revised target price of $49.00, up from $48.00, and a more cautious outlook on future M&amp;A activity. Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) stock surged by 10% after reporting second-quarter financial results in mid-August, ranking as the second-best performance in the Desjardins E&amp;P coverage universe. CEO Rich Kruger's successful efforts in cutting costs and streamlining non-core assets, especially after the recent UK North Sea disposition, are noted. Operational improvements and favorable commodity prices have also been beneficial. However, ConocoPhillips' consolidation of Surmont potentially sets back Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) Base Mine replacement plans as it nears its end-of-life in the mid-2030s, with production declines expected soon. The inevitable consolidation of TotalEnergies Canada's Fort Hills is expected, and SU may need to explore other M&amp;A opportunities, possibly at richer valuations, given the altered oil sands landscape. Most of the near-term catalysts have materialized, and other Canadian large caps offer more promising short-term upside potential.Artisan International Value Fund made the following comment about Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU), a Canada-based operator of oil sands mines, refineries and retail gas stations, was the third-largest contributor to return for the year, mainly due to higher oil prices. The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven &amp; i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business. Given the cyclicality and commodity nature of the oil business, we have sold shares of these investments, including the complete sale of both Tenaris and Imperial Oil.”08. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.04 (-0.84%)On September 18, Redburn-Atlantic analyst Kunaal Malde downgraded Global Payments (NYSE: GPN) from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell"" due to increased competition in the payment processing industry. The current stock price after the downgrade is $123.30, reflecting a decrease of 0.8%.Artisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable trims in the quarter included Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Teledyne Technologies and Envista Holdings. Global Payments is a provider of payments technology solutions for merchants. Increased competition in the fintech sector has weighed on the company’s valuation since the pandemic. While we expect Global Payments to continue to grow its sales and profits, the slowing economy presents a risk over the coming year. In addition, the recent retirement of the CEO raises questions about the vitality of the company’s profit cycle. While the valuation remains attractive, we harvested a portion of our position in favor of newer ideas with more visible profit acceleration.”07. Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.38 (-1.41%)On September 18, Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) experienced a 1.4% decline in its share price following a downgrade by William Blair. In explaining his decision, Analyst Jason Ader pointed to several factors warranting caution, with one key concern being the ""unimpressive outlook for organic revenue growth in 2024."" Consequently, Ader revised his rating on Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) from ""Outperform"" to ""Market Perform."" The downgrade by William Blair underscores the challenges and uncertainties that Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) faces in the near future. While the company has enjoyed previous periods of growth and positive market sentiment, concerns about its revenue outlook for 2024 have prompted this reevaluation by the analyst.Here is what Arch Capital specifically said about Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) in its Q2, 2022 Investor Letter:“In March, we decided to buy Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX) with some of our cash position. We had sold the stock in 2021 due solely to valuation concerns, but with the stock cratering in early 2022, we decided to revisit the company. It turns out, the business was still as strong as ever. If you want more detail on why we like Dropbox, you can read our report from back in Q1 here.”06. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.55 (-1.99%)Founded in 1992, NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is based in San Jose, California. It delivers cloud-centric data services globally, enabling data management and sharing across on-premises, private, and public clouds. The company operates in two segments: Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. NetApp, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) operates through direct sales and partner networks. On September 18, William Blair's Jason Ader downgraded NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) from ""Outperform"" to ""Market Perform."" Ader noted that NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) cloud services have become a significant part of the business, contributing 8% of total revenue with cloud services ARR of $619 million and cloud revenue of $154 million in the most recent quarter ending July 31, 2023.

The GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $75.41, indicating that the stock is fairly valued. Here is the income breakdown of NetApp:Unveiling NetApp (NTAP)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) stock gives every indication of being fairly valued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Because NetApp is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling NetApp (NTAP)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of NetAppInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. NetApp has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.11, which is worse than 54.03% of 2371 companies in the Hardware industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of NetApp at 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of NetApp is fair.This is the debt and cash of NetApp over the past years:Unveiling NetApp (NTAP)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and Growth of NetAppIt is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. NetApp has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $6.20 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.53. Its operating margin is 17.57%, which ranks better than 90.34% of 2444 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of NetApp is ranked 9 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of NetApp is 7.6%, which ranks better than 59.63% of 2336 companies in the Hardware industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 7.1%, which ranks worse than 56.55% of 1963 companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, NetApp's return on invested capital is 16.76, and its cost of capital is 10.86.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of NetApp is shown below:Unveiling NetApp (NTAP)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Zimmer Biomet Holdings'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zimmer Biomet Holdings is:4.1% = US$507m ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.04.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Zimmer Biomet Holdings' Earnings Growth And 4.1% ROEIt is quite clear that Zimmer Biomet Holdings' ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.2%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 6.3% seen by Zimmer Biomet Holdings over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Zimmer Biomet Holdings' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 9.3% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ZBH? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Zimmer Biomet Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 45% (or a retention ratio of 55%) which is pretty normal, Zimmer Biomet Holdings' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 11% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 12% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Zimmer Biomet Holdings' performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

But look a little closer, and you’ll see the rally has been very narrow. Most of these gains have been concentrated heavily in the FAANGs and AI darlings like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) . Many other high-growth companies doing just as well (if not better!) have been left behind.This creates a massive opportunity today for investors willing to venture beyond the crowd favorites. While the market chases the hot momentum stocks, diamonds in the rough are there for the taking. These are stocks worth buying before their share prices catch up to reflect their full value.Here are three growth stocks trading at a massive bargain to snap up right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEvolution (EVVTY)A man looking at a computer with poker chips on the screen.Source: rawf8/Shutterstock.comEvolution (OTCMKTS:EVVTY), the Swedish provider of online casino solutions, has seen its stock tumble over 45% from its 2021 peak. However, the company’s business fundamentals remain strong, with Q2 revenue up 28% year-over-year. Evolution’s EBITDA also increased 31% to €312 million, representing an impressive margin of 71%.While revenue growth slowed from Q1, Evolution continues expanding globally with new studio launches planned in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. The company is also gearing up to release over 100 new games in the back half of 2023, including potential hits like Lightning Lotto.Despite growth hiccups, analysts still expect 23% revenue growth in 2023 and 20% in 2024. With the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 20-times, I believe most negativity is overdone or priced into this stock. Evolution still has a long runway for growth in Europe, Asia, and the fledgling U.S. iGaming market. Gurufocus’ $194 2024 fair price tag implies nearly 90% upside. Indeed, this fallen angel looks like a strong turnaround play to me.Story continuesSurgePays (SURG)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocksSource: Peshkova / ShutterstockSurgePays (NASDAQ:SURG) stock been wobbling over the past year, as investors worry about potential changes to the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) that has driven much of the company’s growth. However, the SurgePays just delivered record Q2 results, including $6 million in net income and $35.9 million in revenue, up 28% year-over-year. The latter metric did miss by $3.16 million, but I believe that has been more than priced in.More importantly, SurgePays is mitigating ACP risk by expanding its distribution network and product portfolio. Partnerships with the likes of LeadEx and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs position the company to drive additional ACP subscribers while reducing acquisition costs.Meanwhile, the planned rollout of its own prepaid wireless brand and additions like customer-facing LCD screens at convenience stores will reduce reliance on ACP. SurgePays now targets 13,000 stores on its platform by year-end, which will double its reach. Thus, the negativity appears to be fully priced in with SURG stock, as it trades at just 3.7-times 2023 earnings projections.Maxim Group has a lofty $15 price target for the stock, implying over 200% upside potential in a year. If the company executes on its growth plans, SURG stock could deliver explosive returns from today’s depressed levels. This looks like a deep value play in the making. Its price-sales ratio also comes in at 0.46-times, which is very low for a company expected to pull well above 20% top-line growth per year.ResMed (RMD)a webpage for ResMed (RMD)Source: PREMIO STOCK / Shutterstock.comResMed (NYSE:RMD) is a global leader in digital health and cloud-connected medical devices. The company focuses on sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory conditions. The last 18 months have been rough for ResMed. After peaking near $300 per share in mid-2021, shares of RMD stock have traded sideways for all of 2023, recently tumbling nearly 35%.Indeed, that’s the reason it’s at the bottom of today’s list. But I believe there is tremendous long-term potential here.First, let’s figure out why the stock dropped in the first place. ResMed narrowly missed revenue expectations by $17.4 million, delivering $1.12 billion in revenue (up 22.7% year-over-year) and $1.60 in earnings per share (up ~17% year-over-year) missed by 9 cents. This does look bad, but does this warrant the company’s valuation being wiped by one third? Nope.In reaction, the company went ex-dividend last month, but that still wouldn’t turn me away from this clear bargain. The average price target of $235 now implies 59% upside in one year, and even the lowest price target of $170 will deliver great upside. Personally, the risk seems worth the potential reward, in this case.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While explosive growth stocks can generate life-changing gains during bull markets, they often face existential risk during downturns or crises. That’s why even growth-focused investors should allocate a portion of their portfolio to dependable blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks represent industry-leading companies with solid balance sheets, consistent profitability, and durable competitive advantages. They provide stable returns across market cycles, while minimizing downside portfolio risk. Though they may not outperform during speculative rallies, blue chips offer resilient income and capital appreciation regardless of broader economic fluctuations.In today’s late-cycle environment, I believe doubling down on quality is prudent. While I don’t anticipate a recession hitting imminently, this economic expansion has been historically elongated. And with markets jittery, valuations compressed, and volatility persisting, blue chips provide ballast.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe seven stocks highlighted in this article check every blue-chip box. They boast strong cash flows, dividend growth, wide moats, and leadership in fields ranging from consumer staples to healthcare. Though past performance never guarantees future results, these companies have flourished through varying economic climates for decades. Let’s take a look!Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) enjoys a lucrative position as a leading provider of management and technology consulting to the U.S. government. The company assists vital military, intelligence, and civil agencies, fueling steady growth and profits. Of note, BAH’s backlog has recently swelled to $31 billion.Government outsourcing should prove recession-resilient as budgets remain expansive. Meanwhile, priority areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and modernizing IT infrastructure necessitate Booz Allen’s expertise. The company’s top line expanded by 18% year-over-year to $2.65 billion, in the latest reported quarter. Year-end sales growth is estimated to be above 11.4%, and I believe this is excellent growth for a company of this size.Story continuesThough BAH trades at a premium 22-times forward earnings, its 17% profit growth warrants a quality premium. The stock also pays a sustainable 1.7% dividend. Investors benefit from market-beating growth paired with defense stock stability, an ideal blue-chip combination.Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has the most significant rural lifestyle retail store footprint in the United States. The company meets the unique needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, and tradespeople who depend on its products daily. With inflation boosting food prices, Tractor Supply provides income-strapped rural consumers with cost-effective solutions for tending livestock, crops, lawns, and gardens.Despite economic fluctuations, demand for Tractor Supply’s products persists thanks to the non-discretionary nature of their products. The company has increased yearly sales since at least 1994 – a feat few retailers can match. Over the past five years, TSCO stock has grown by nearly 150%, driven by consistently high profit growth. Likewise, its dividend per share has grown at a 25.8% annualized pace over the past half-decade.Trading at 21-times forward earnings, Tractor Supply looks reasonably-priced, given its time-tested business model and loyal customer base. The stock deserves a place in income and blue-chip-focused portfolios.Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comWhen times get tough, consumers still wash their clothes, clean their homes, and disinfect surfaces. That’s what makes Clorox (NYSE:CLX) such a resilient stock. The company owns 20 brands, including Kingsford charcoal, Glad trash bags, and its namesake Clorox bleach. Clorox products offer reliable value during inflationary periods, evidenced by decades of steady sales and cash flows.Despite some pandemic-related volatility, Clorox has compounded its dividend at a 6.3% annual rate over the past five years. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $367 million of cash against less than $3 billion of debt. While supply chain constraints impacted recent results, management is working to improve operations and its financial ratios over time.New product innovations and increased brand spending should also catalyze growth. Trading at 26-times forward earnings, CLX stock isn’t cheap. But you pay a fair price for quality. This blue-chip stalwart deserves consideration from income and low-volatility investors. The company’s dividend currently yields 3.1%, and I believe its current share price is unlikely to go any lower.Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comDiversified industrial giant Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a textbook blue chip company. Honeywell provides mission-critical solutions to aerospace, chemicals, defense, healthcare, and other key industries. This diversification mutes risk, as weakness in any end-market gets offset elsewhere. Despite varying macro conditions, Honeywell posted 18% net income growth in the latest reported quarter.Honeywell’s balance sheet is rock-solid, carrying an A credit rating from Fitch. The company generates ample cash to fund its dividend and growth initiatives. It has raised its payout by 7.6% annually over the past five years. Additionally, Honeywell repurchases shares opportunistically as well.Despite near-term macro concerns, Honeywell’s leadership sees strength ahead. Commercial flight activity continues to recover, fueling aerospace demand. Energy, non-residential construction, and pent-up infrastructure investment provide additional tailwinds. At 20-times earnings, HON stock offers reasonable value. The company’s defensive attributes combined with its upside potential check all the blue-chip boxes.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comWith cavernous warehouses packed with vats of peanut butter and pallets of paper towels, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) wins by selling staples in bulk. The company pioneered the membership warehouse model, in which customers pay an annual fee for the right to shop at steep discounts unavailable elsewhere. This subscription-based structure gives Costco immense pricing power, insulating it from recessions better than traditional retailers.Members flock to load up on household essentials and discounted gasoline while treasure-hunting “hot buys” on everything from jewelry to patio furniture. Costco’s affluent customers have remained resilient through economic ups and downs. Despite looming recession risks, membership renewal rates recently hit an all-time high of 92.6% domestically and 90.5% worldwide.Costco can continue to thrive amidst inflation due to its scale, efficient supply chain, and Kirkland private label brand. The company boasts a fortress balance sheet with $13.7 billion in cash and only $9 billion of debt. Costco has hiked its dividend annually since 2004, though it currently yields a modest 0.7%. Again, shares do trade at a premium, but Costco remains a best-in-class retail operator built to weather economic turbulence.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comWith tens of thousands of restaurants worldwide serving 69 million customers daily, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has honed convenient, consistent, and craveable fast food down to a science. The company’s global scale and real estate footprint are tremendous competitive advantages, as is its branding power. After 70 years in business, the Golden Arches remain one of Earth’s most iconic and valuable logos.McDonald’s combination of convenience, value, and familiarity makes it a go-to choice when consumers grow price-sensitive during downturns. Drive-thrus and delivery provide easy access, while Dollar Menu items appeal to cash-strapped diners trading down for pricier restaurant fare.Though the restaurant industry generally suffers steep declines during recessions, McDonald’s has shown remarkable resilience. The stock rose 8.55% in 2008 amidst the Great Recession and grew 11.3% despite COVID-induced lockdowns in 2020. I find that astonishing, since, again, this is a restaurant business.McDonald’s has increased its dividend annually since 1976, qualifying it as a dividend aristocrat. With a reasonable 25-times price-earnings ratio and a 2.2% dividend yield, the stock looks poised to satisfy investors’ hunger for stability.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comBest known for its namesake sodas and sports drinks, global food and beverage titan PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) also owns billion-dollar snack brands such as Frito-Lay, Cheetos, and Doritos. This diversification provides a layer of defense lacking in more narrowly focused rivals. PepsiCo’s products face steady demand regardless of economic conditions – consumers still sip soda and munch chips when times get tough, perhaps to a greater degree.The company has paid dividends since 1965 and raised its payout annually over the last 52 years, marking PepsiCo as a dividend king. Currently, PEP stock yields a safe 2.8%. PepsiCo holds leading positions across its portfolio, owns coveted retail shelf space, boasts unmatched distribution scale, and invests aggressively in advertising and product innovation.With rising pricing power, an excellent balance sheet, and a recession-resistant mix of staple food and beverages, PepsiCo appears poised to deliver stability during rocky markets. The stock provides investors with a quality option at a reasonable valuation. I find it hard to justify leaving PEP stock out of any blue-chip portfolio, no matter how obvious of a pick it may be.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

514,170f52cc-31ef-34a8-b0ef-d3bdfaa55dfd,MDLZ,2023-09-20,3 Inflation-Proof Consumer Staples Stocks Worth a Watch Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-inflation-proof-consumer-staples-122100184.html,1695039660,STORY,"['MKC', 'MDLZ', 'HSY', 'MKC-V']","[Inflationary pressure remains stubbornly high in the United States lately, thanks to a rise in fuel prices. Therefore, investors must closely watch consumer staples stocks such as Mondelez International MDLZ, Hershey HSY and McCormick &amp; Company MKC as they provide a natural hedge against inflation.Consumer Price Still Running HotPrices of indispensable goods and services continue to move northward. For August, the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.6% month over month and registered its biggest monthly increase in 14 months, per the Labor Department. The CPI climbed 3.7% last month from a year ago.The core CPI also advanced both on a monthly and yearly basis in August. In reality, increases in consumer prices were broad-based as the current rise in oil prices across the globe perked up price pressures. Robust demand for oil amid tighter supply pushed oil prices to this year’s highest level (read more: 4 Stocks to Gain as Oil Prices Hit 2023 Highs).The cost of food, shelter, gasoline and airfares increased in August. Additionally, the cost of home furnishing, auto insurance, trucks and cars rose last month.Wholesale Price Scale NorthwardThe recent report on wholesale inflation is similar to consumer prices in August. The producer price index (PPI) increased 0.7% month over month in August and notched its biggest monthly gain in 14 months. The PPI increased 1.6% in August over the past 12 months.The so-called core PPI that generally strips out the volatile energy and food costs also edged up monthly and yearly last month. Nonetheless, wholesale prices that tend to indicate future inflation trends advanced in August, fueled by higher energy costs.Consumer Staples Stocks Act as a Protection Against InflationElevated oil prices leading to a rise in inflation decreases the purchasing power of your dollars. This leads to a drop in consumer outlays, which impacts economic growth and spurs volatility in the stock market.Story continuesHowever, investors shouldn’t stay away from investing in stocks. Instead, they should bet on companies that are unperturbed by price pressures and their adverse effects on the stock market.Such stocks belong to the consumer staples sector. Consumers may be compelled to cut back on discretionary spending but must purchase staple products.

This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’s innovative cloud products and services.This move of FanDuel has added strength to its existing relationship with AWS.Per the terms, FanDuel will leverage AWS’s cloud computing infrastructure to expand across the United States and Canada efficiently.More precisely, it plans to utilize AWS Outposts and Local Zones to scale its business into new as well as existing markets.FanDuel has already been using AWS edge solutions to boost its security and scalability and meet regulatory requirements.Amazon.com, Inc.

The difference today, and what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are often accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.""Don’t Miss:Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.According to OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais, the IEA's claims could have significant global repercussions.""Such narratives only set the global energy system up to fail spectacularly. It would lead to energy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale, with dire consequences for economies and billions of people across the world,"" al-Ghais said.OPEC argued that the IEA's reasoning on fossil fuels is ""ideologically driven"" instead of fact-based. It also noted that fossil fuels still make up more than 80% of the global energy mix and that they provide ""vital"" energy security for the world.OPEC's statement came on the heels of recent surges in oil prices. If you share this perspective on the enduring importance of fossil fuels, you might want to pay close attention to oil stocks. Here's a look at three that Wall Street finds particularly attractive.Story continuesExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM)Commanding over $450 billion of market capitalization, Exxon Mobil is one of the largest players in the global oil and gas industry.Shares enjoyed huge rallies in 2021 and 2022. And the latest rise in oil prices seems to give the stock more upward momentum: Over the past month, Exxon stock has climbed 8%.The business continues to gush profits and cash flow.According to the latest earnings report, Exxon earned $7.9 billion in profits in the second quarter. It also generated $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $5 billion of free cash flow.The company is returning cash to investors, too. In the second quarter, Exxon paid $3.7 billion in dividends and spent $4.3 billion on share repurchases.At the current share price, the stock yields 3.1%.Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott has an Overweight rating on Exxon and a price target of $124, implying a potential upside of 6%.Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE:DVN)Devon Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations focused onshore in the U.S.In the second quarter, the company's oil production reached an all-time high of 323,000 barrels per day.For the quarter, the company's operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $326 million.""Our disciplined reinvestment rates allowed us to generate free cash flow for the 12th consecutive quarter, and we returned $690 million of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases,"" Devon CEO Rick Muncrief said in a statement.The company's latest quarterly dividend — to be paid on Sept. 29 — is 49 cents per share. Note that Devon pays a fixed-plus-variable dividend so the amount could change from one quarter to the next.Stifel analyst Derrick Whitfield has a Buy rating on Devon and a price target of $79 — around 49% above where the stock currently sits.Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY)Shares of Occidental Petroleum more than doubled in 2022. The company benefited from elevated oil prices. At the same time, it received more investor attention after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed a sizable stake in it last year.Buffett bought more shares of Occidental in 2023, with Berkshire owning 224.1 million shares of the company at the end of June.In the second quarter, Occidental produced 1.22 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which exceeded the mid-point of its guidance range.Buffett isn't the only one to see potential in the oil giant. Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann has a Buy rating on Occidental and a price target of $80. Because shares currently trade at $66.26, the price target implies a potential upside of 21%.Keep in mind that because of the volatile nature of commodity prices, even the largest oil companies can experience significant fluctuations in their share prices. If you appreciate the generous shareholder returns offered by the oil sector but aren't a fan of such volatility, it might be worth exploring reliable income plays outside the stock market, such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Having managed the $8 billion large-cap fund since 2000, the veteran investor’s hot stock picks are always in demand by investors. In Nygren’s episode, he discusses financial stocks, pointing out that although the Oakmark Fund had 37% of its net assets in financial stocks, only about 40% is in banks. As a result, its weighting for banks overall is just 15%. That’s more than manageable. Nygren believes financials are cheap right now. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“[If] you look over 30 or 50 years, they [financial services] tend to sell on average at maybe 80%, maybe as much as 90% of the S&amp;P multiple, but rarely do they get above that, with the exception of some of the really high-quality companies that are called financial services today, like MasterCard, Visa, Moody’s,” Nygren said. Oakmark’s having a good year, up nearly 19% year-to-date, 238 basis points higher than the S&amp;P 500.With Nygren’s fund on a roll, here are three hot stock picks from the portfolio manager’s 59 holdings. At least one will be from the financial sector. Capital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comCapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) is first on the list of Nygren’s stock picks, and was the Oakmark Fund’s second-largest position as of July 31, with a 3.2% weighting. Nygren likes Capital One for several reasons.First, it doesn’t have long-duration mortgage risk because most of its assets are in credit cards and auto loans. Secondly, it could securitize its entire auto loan portfolio and still make money on the transaction. Third, its deposit base is far less likely to pull a Silicon Valley Bank move and bolt simultaneously. That makes its deposit base very sticky. Warren Buffett also likes Capital One. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) purchased 2.55 million shares of the bank holding company in the second quarter. Berkshire now owns 12.5 million COF shares, or 3.3% of the bank.  Story continuesHigher interest rates mean it’s collecting more on car loans, etc. While delinquencies will tick up, they’ll likely be offset by the higher interest earned on those loans. In March, I selected Capital One and two other bank stocks doing big things with artificial intelligence (AI). For example, it created Slingshot to help customers manage their Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) data. Is it a coincidence that Berkshire owns both Capital One and Snowflake? I don’t think so.CBRE Group (CBRE)An image of a person typing at a kayboard with data overlaid, hand pointing toward dataSource: everything possible/ShutterstockCBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) was the Oakmark Fund’s 13th-largest position as of July 31 with a 2.1% weighting.As most investors realize, AI is one of the hottest topics. On Aug. 21, CBRE announced that its Smart Facilities (FM) Solutions, which are powered by AI and advanced data analytics, just went over the one billion mark. That’s one billion square feet of commercial workspace at more than 20,000 sites using FM to run their offices more efficiently. Nygren highlights in his Morningstar podcast that the old CBRE was very transaction-driven. Thus, earnings fell when transactions were down due to the cyclical nature of its business. Now, it’s generating far more recurring revenue that, while maybe not glamorous, keeps the coffers full no matter the economic environment. “Today, the services part of their business, such as janitorial services for tenants in their buildings, those aren’t cyclical really at all, and those are becoming the more dominant part of the business value,” Nygren said. For example, CBRE generated $7.72 billion in revenue in the second quarter. The most significant chunk (48%) was from facilities management provided by its Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) operating segment. Nothing else comes close. Overall, its GWS business accounts for 70% of CBRE’s overall revenue – project management accounts for GWS’ other $1.74 billion in revenue – and 37% of its $306.5 million in core operating income. In the second quarter, GWS’ operating income increased by 13%, while its more traditional Advisory Services fell by 46% over Q2 2022.  If you own CBRE stock, be thankful GWS exists. With it, quarters like this past one would make life much easier. Expect Advisory Services to bounce back in 2024.KKR &amp; Co. (KKR)A photo of a businesswoman pointing at charts on a piece of paper on a table.Source: kan_chana/ShutterStock.comLast on the list of hot stock picks is KKR &amp; Co. (NYSE:KKR) was the Oakmark Fund’s 4th-largest position as of July 31 with a 2.8% weighting.I’ve been fascinated by KKR ever since I read Barbarians at the Gate, the story of how the investment firm managed to capture RJR Nabisco in a 1988 leveraged buyout (LBO). I heartily recommend it. Today, of course, KKR is far more than an LBO specialist, with $519 billion in assets under management as of June 30. Of those assets, $420 billion generates healthy fees from its investors, etc. Like most alternative asset managers, KKR constantly raises capital for its various funds in private equity, real estate, credit, infrastructure, and more. In the second quarter, it raised $13 billion in new capital, bringing its new capital raised in the latest 12 months to $54 billion. Nygren likes KKR rather than other private equity shops because it invests in its own products – the funds I mentioned above. “So, when you look at the balance sheet, there’s a very large line called ‘investments.’ Most of the other private equity firms were paying out almost all of their income, so they did not have that big ‘investments’ line,” Nygren said in the podcast. At the end of the second quarter, the investments’ line of KKR’s balance sheet was $231.5 billion, up 7% from $216.6 billion at the end of 2022. That’s 80% of its $287.7 billion in total assets. For example, its investments in private equity at the end of June were $29.9 billion. At the end of the second quarter, its private equity assets under management were $171.5 billion, so its investment in private equity accounts for 17% of its total assets under management. That’s a big deal.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Kaftrio is also approved in the United States under the brand name Trikafta to treat CF in people aged two years and older who have at least one F508del mutation.Besides EU and the United States, Trikaftais approved by regulatory authorities in Great Britain, Australia and Canada, for people with CF aged six and above.Shares of Vertex have risen 20.9% year to date against the industry’s 14.0% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVRTX enjoys a dominant position in the CF market. Trikafta/ Kaftrio generated revenues of $4.34 billion in the first half of 2023, accounting for almost 89% of the company’s total revenues. The label extension of the drug will expand its targeted patient population as more than 12,000 children will be eligible for the drug. This will likely result in increased sales of the drug in the upcoming quarters.While CF remains the main area of focus, VRTX is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD), transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, type I diabetes, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The company also has earlier-stage programs in diseases, such as muscular dystrophies.Most notable among these non-CF indications is Vertex’s collaboration agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP for the development and commercialization of exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) to treat SCD and TDT.Story continuesIn the United States, the FDA granted priority review to the biologics license applications (BLAs) filing for exa-cel in SCD indication, while the exa-cel filing in TDT indication has been accepted for a standard review by the agency. Final decisions on the BLAs for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications are expected by Dec 8, 2023, and Mar 30, 2024, respectively. Vertex believes exa-cel has the potential to be a one-time functional cure for SCD and TDT patients with an estimated patient population of approximately 32,000.The FDA nod to exa-cel will also make it Vertex’s first marketed product approved in a non-CF indication.

The company's current share price sits at US$76.13, while the estimated fair value is US$119, a significant difference from the analyst-projected price target of US$85.86.The valuation process used the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, which estimates a company's intrinsic value by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The DCF model operates under the principle that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. As such, it aggregates future cash flows and discounts them to their current value. For Textron, the present value of its projected 10-year cash flow stands at an estimated US$8.2 billion.This valuation approach employed a 2-stage growth model that considers two phases of a company's growth - an initial period of potentially higher growth followed by a stage of stable growth. This methodology required estimations of Textron's cash flows for the next decade. In instances where analyst estimates were not available, extrapolations were made from previous free cash flow (FCF) values.However, it's crucial to note that while the DCF is an effective tool for estimating intrinsic value, it may not always be ideal due to its dependence on assumptions about future growth rates and cash flows. For companies experiencing declining free cash flow, it was assumed that their rate of shrinkage would slow down; conversely, for those with expanding free cash flow, it was projected that their growth rate would decelerate over time.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The railroad first announced plans in May to create the program. The train caught fire and released over a million gallons of hazardous materials and pollutants.Senator Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate committee that oversees railroads, said Norfolk Southern had made good on the promise it made in May, calling the fund ""one of the most consequential actions taken to date for helping Ohioans and Pennsylvanians affected by the accident.""The fund covers a radius of approximately 5 miles (8 km) around the derailment. Cruz said the total coverage is 91 square miles, including portions of Columbiana and Mahoning Counties in Ohio and Beaver and Lawrence Counties in Pennsylvania.The final fund is expected to be part of the resolution of litigation resulting from the derailment, but Cruz said the interim fund ""accelerates compensation for homeowners who decide to move with the benefit of this protection.""The U.S. Justice Department and state of Ohio have both sued Norfolk Southern.The company has so far booked charges of $803 million for the derailment. It said it does not have a cost estimate for the home value program.Norfolk Southern has also said it supports a ""solution that addresses long-term health risks through the creation of a long-term medical compensation fund."" Another program would help protect East Palestine drinking water.Last month, the Transportation Department's Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) said Norfolk Southern needs ""significant improvements"" in its safety culture and disclosed it is considering enforcement actions against the railroad on a number of issues, including track maintenance, inspection, repair practices and hours of service regulations.In May, a U.S. Senate panel approved bipartisan rail safety legislation that tightens rules on trains carrying explosive substances like the Norfolk Southern-operated train, but further action has stalled.

From 1964 to 2022, his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) delivered an overall gain of 3,787,464%, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500's 24,708% return during the same period.Other than picking stocks that skyrocketed in value, Buffett also collects dividends — a lot of dividends.Buffett famously said, ""If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""Don’t Miss:Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth and generate passive income before he floods it with new tech workers.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Plenty of companies in Buffett's portfolio pay dividends to shareholders. The most notable is perhaps Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO).Buffett started buying Coca-Cola shares in the late 1980s. Today, Berkshire holds 400 million shares of the beverage giant that are worth $23.1 billion.It's no secret that Buffet has been a fan of the soft drink. He once said, ""If I eat 2,700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola.""More importantly, Buffett has unwavering confidence in the company's business.""If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done,"" he said.That confidence is paying off handsomely in the form of passive income. In 2022, Coca-Cola paid four quarterly dividends of 44 cents per share — or $1.76 per share for the year. Considering that Berkshire held 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, it collected $704 million in dividends from the company last year.But you don't need to be the Oracle of Omaha to earn dividends from the beverage giant.Growing Dividends From Coca-ColaCoca-Cola was paying quarterly dividends of 44 cents per share in 2022. But the payout isn't standing still. In February 2023, Coca-Cola's board approved a 4.6% increase to the quarterly dividend to 46 cents per share.Story continuesThat marked the company's 61st consecutive annual dividend hike.Despite the ups and downs the world economy went through over the last six decades, Coca-Cola shareholders received bigger dividend checks every year.Coca-Cola follows a quarterly distribution schedule. If you want to collect $1,000 per month from the company, you are looking at $3,000 per quarter. And that means you would need to own about 6,522 shares of the company. This is calculated by dividing the $3,000 by the per-share quarterly payout of $0.46.And because Coca-Cola currently trades at $56.65 per share, 6,522 shares would mean about $369,471.30 worth of the stock.If you aim for a smaller target of earning $200 per month — or $600 per quarter — you would need 1,305 shares ($600/$0.46) or $73,928.25 worth of Coca-Cola stock (1,305 x $56.25).Despite the company's solid dividend growth track record, shares can still be volatile. Year to date, Coca-Cola stock has fallen about 10%.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian sees better days ahead for the beverage company. The analyst has an Overweight rating on Coca-Cola and a price target of $65 — around 15% above where the stock currently sits.Remember, stocks can fluctuate wildly, and even top analysts aren't right 100% of the time. So always conduct comprehensive research and due diligence before diving in.Read next:Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

WPP, the world's top advertising group, in August downgraded its full-year growth forecast due to lower spending by technology companies.""The result (of the contract) will be better decision-making and media planning to allow campaigns to build brands and win consumer attention at scale,"" a Nestle spokesperson said in a statement.Nestle declined to comment on how much it spends on advertising and marketing in Europe, or on details of the deal, such as its length. The Swiss company previously employed a number of media agencies across Europe.WPP OpenMind will coordinate Nestle's marketing communications - including buying advertising space and planning campaigns - for its hundreds of brands in Europe including Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee.The agency will not, however, be in charge of creative work such as animation, making jingles and other content generation.Nestle said Tuesday's announcement was for Europe only, and had no bearing on other regions.Like many of its rivals, Nestle's spending on marketing was muted last year largely because of supply chain problems and uncertainty over consumer behaviour, but has returned this year.Top brands are battling to hold onto customers as some cut spending or switch to cheaper alternatives amid rising prices.CEO Mark Schneider said in July that Nestle's second-quarter marketing spend was ""significantly above last year's level"" and it would ""continue to invest in a very robust manner in the second half of 2023"".In the first half of 2023, Nestle's advertising and marketing spend increased by 7.5% in constant currency versus the same period of the prior year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income and its benefits in today's world, and go directly to read 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. The concept of passive income is becoming increasingly popular as more people are leaning towards side jobs. A survey by Zapier from May 2022 found that 36% of Gen Xers have a side job, while 59% of Gen Zers and 61% of millennials have one. Gen Zers, in particular, make around $9,537 annually from their side gigs. These side hustles can be a very good way to supplement income, though they are not typically considered passive income sources. However, some side hustles may become more passive over time as people streamline operations, delegate tasks, or automate processes. Earlier this year, CNBC did a report on Jasmine McCall, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who makes $105,000 a month in passive income from her side hustle.Passive income typically comes from investments, assets, or activities that require minimal ongoing effort once set up. Last year’s inflation increased the appeal of passive investing in stocks, particularly dividend-paying stocks. Passive equity funds, which are primarily designed for long-term capital appreciation and wealth accumulation, are about to achieve a significant milestone. Their total assets worldwide are soon going to surpass the assets of actively managed funds, a trend that has been developing for over a decade, as reported by Societe Generale. According to James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, passive investing has been growing consistently in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds or passive ETFs own about 19% of the shares of the typical publicly traded U.S. stock. This ownership has tripled since 2013.AI and Passive IncomeIn a recent survey conducted by GOBankingRates, people were asked about their thoughts on using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate passive income. The results were positive, with 45% of respondents expressing their interest in using AI for passive income, and an extra 8% mentioned they had already done so.Story continuesAI-focused companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can potentially help people earn passive income. The company with its expansive digital ecosystem, offers opportunities for passive income through advertising revenue for content creators on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) utilizes AI in various aspects of its business, including its e-commerce and cloud services. Earning passive income through the company can be achieved through various avenues, primarily by participating in its affiliate program, publishing ebooks on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), or utilizing Amazon's print-on-demand services.All these strategies mentioned above can help generate passive income, but investing in dividend-paying stocks is also a dependable way to make money passively. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some well-known companies that have raised their dividends for decades, providing a regular stream of income to investors.Earning passive income can be a good idea when it aligns with one’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and available resources. Diversifying income sources and planning for the long term can enhance financial well-being. In this article, we will discuss 25 best passive income ideas to build wealth in 2023.Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured through several credible and expert sources, including Forbes, Reddit, CNBC, Barron's, and Business Insider, renowned for their insights and expertise in the field of finance and passive income. By aggregating information from these reputable outlets, we aimed to identify common threads and consensus recommendations regarding strategies for generating passive income. Our goal was to offer a curated selection of passive income ideas that have garnered recognition and success among individuals pursuing passive income.25. Music and Photo LicensingA music license is permission granted to use copyrighted music. It's commonly used in movies, TV shows, commercials, online videos, and any visual content that wants to use a song legally. It is one of the best passive income ideas as the process involves creating high-quality content, registering copyrights, and uploading work to licensing platforms like Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK), Adobe Stock, or music libraries. Shutterstock remained popular among elite funds in Insider Monkey’s database, as 31 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of Q2 2023, up from 25 in the previous quarter.24. Rent out Your Spare RoomEarning passive income by renting out a spare room in your home can be a lucrative way to make extra money. However, it is always advised to check local laws and regulations regarding room rentals. Some areas may have specific rules, permits, or taxes related to short-term rentals. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the most well-known platforms for renting out spare rooms and entire homes to travelers. ABNB has delivered a 68.14% return to shareholders since the start of 2023, as of September 16.23. Record AudiobooksRecording audiobooks is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. It is important to choose a niche or genre of audiobooks and invest in good recording equipment to create professional-quality audiobooks. Distribution platforms like Audible allow the publishing of these audiobooks and make them available for sale on major audiobooks retailers such as iTunes and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).22. Buy and Sell WebsitesBuying and selling websites for passive income can be a profitable online business model. It involves acquiring existing websites, improving them, and then selling them for a profit. It is also important to continuously monitor the website's performance, make necessary adjustments, and track key metrics like traffic, revenue, and profitability.21. Develop a Niche Job BoardDeveloping a niche job board refers to creating an online platform or website that specializes in listing job opportunities within a specific industry, profession, or category. Unlike general job search websites like Indeed or LinkedIn, which cover a wide range of job types and industries, a niche job board focuses on a particular niche or sector. After setting up the job board, making money by charging companies for posting job listings is a good way to earn passive income. Indeed, SimplyHired, and CareerBuilder are some of the most prominent websites that operate niche job boards.20. Sell Your NotesSelling notes typically involves creating and selling study or course materials, lecture notes, or educational content to students or learners. Well-researched, organized, and easy-to-understand notes provide real value to the target audience and are and are priced competitively. Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is one of the largest online marketplaces for educational resources. It allows teachers and educators to sell their lesson plans, worksheets, and other educational materials.19. Run an Affiliate Marketing BusinessRunning an affiliate marketing business is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. It involves promoting other companies' products or services and earning commissions for driving sales or leads to those businesses. Consistent, quality content and effective SEO can help maintain a steady flow of commissions, making it a potentially lucrative source of passive income over the long term. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s affiliates program is one of the largest and most popular. Users can promote a wide range of products on the Amazon platform and earn commissions on sales generated through your affiliate links.18. Create a Mobile AppCreating a mobile app can be a potential source of passive income. People should either create the app themselves if they have the skills or hire a developer. It is important to make sure that the app is user-friendly, well-designed, and functions smoothly. The monetization strategy works best when earning passive income.17. Purchase ATMsPurchasing ATMs involves a specific business model and understanding of the ATM industry but it can be a very reliable way to earn passive income. When someone uses the ATM to withdraw cash, they are charged a fee for convenience, a part of which goes to the ATM owner.16. Start an E-Commerce StoreStarting an e-commerce store is one of the most popular passive income ideas today. The pandemic of 2020 has boosted online shopping and income seekers are trying to make the most of this trend. According to a report on digital shopping, more than 265 million consumers in the US are expected to be shopping online in 2023. People can earn passive income by setting up an online retail business that operates with minimal day-to-day involvement once it's established. E-commerce platforms like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) can help build and host an online store. In the second quarter of 2023, Shopify generated nearly $1.7 billion in revenues, which showed a 31% growth from the same period last year.15. Peer-to-Peer Car RentalsPeer-to-peer car rental is a practice where individuals rent their private vehicles to others on a short-term basis, usually through an online platform or app. It is a profitable venture, especially if the vehicles are underutilized. However, it's crucial to provide excellent customer service, maintain your vehicles, and understand the terms and conditions of the platform you choose. Getaround, Inc. (NYSE:GETR) offers peer-to-peer car sharing in various cities in the US. Car owners can list their vehicles for rent, and renters can book them for short-term use. The company was a part of 15 hedge fund portfolios in our database at the end of Q2 2023.14. Invest in Vending MachinesVending machines are popular among people because of their convenience and ability to provide a wide range of products and services to consumers without the need for human intervention. According to a market report, the worldwide retail vending machine market was worth about $51.91 billion in 2021 and is projected to keep growing at an annual rate of about 10.7% from 2022 to 2030. Income seekers can earn passive income through vending machines by purchasing and strategically placing these machines in high-traffic areas. After initial setup, the machines can generate income with minimal ongoing effort. It is one of the best passive income ideas on our list as effective management and product selection are key to maximizing returns.13. Royalties from Intellectual PropertiesThis idea refers to payments or fees earned by the owner or creator of intellectual property (IP) for allowing others to use, license, or distribute their intellectual assets. Income seekers should ensure that their intellectual property is legally protected through copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other applicable forms of intellectual property rights.12. Sell Designs OnlineEarning passive income by selling designs online is a creative venture. Many online marketplaces allow users to develop unique and high-quality designs that cater to a specific niche or market. This can include graphic designs, illustrations, digital art, t-shirt designs, printables, or any other creative works. Some of the most prominent platforms include Etsy, Inc. (NYSE:ETSY) and Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK).11. Investing in BondsEarning passive income by investing in bonds can be a relatively low-risk way to generate regular income. To invest in bonds, income seekers can buy them directly from the issuer or in the secondary market through a brokerage account. The secondary market allows you to buy and sell bonds from other investors. Holding bonds until they mature ensures that investors receive the full face value of the bond, provided the issuer remains solvent. This approach minimizes interest rate risk. Investors will receive regular interest payments until maturity. They can also choose to reinvest the interest income they receive, compounding the returns over time. Alternatively, investors can use the interest payments as a source of passive income.10. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) BusinessSaaS business is a model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access and use SaaS applications through web browsers. Income seekers can earn passively after developing a valuable software product, setting up a subscription-based pricing model, and continuously attracting and retaining customers. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top SaaS companies. The company’s revenue for Q2 2023 came in at $8.6 billion, which showed an 11.4% growth from the same period last year.9. High-Yield Savings AccountsA high-yield savings account is a type of savings account offered by banks and financial institutions that typically provides a higher interest rate compared to traditional savings accounts. The account with competitive interest rates allows the power of compound interest to work for income seekers. With compounding, the interest gets added to the principal balance, allowing the savings to grow over time.8. Start a Blog or YouTube ChannelStarting a blog or YouTube channel is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. Income seekers can create content according to their own interests or expertise and monetize it through methods like display ads, affiliate marketing, and selling digital products or courses. The passive aspect comes into play once the created content gains traction by attracting viewers and readers over time.7. Create a Subscription Box ServiceThis strategy involves curating and delivering a selection of products or experiences to subscribers on a recurring basis, typically monthly. Profit seekers should select a niche or theme that resonates with their target audience and establish relationships with suppliers to create high-quality themed boxes. Effective marketing strategies are key to attracting subscribers, and once a substantial customer base comes into play, the income becomes passive as subscribers renew their subscriptions automatically.6. Automated DropshippingAutomated dropshipping is a business model in e-commerce where an online retailer (the dropshipper) sells products to customers without physically handling the inventory. Instead, the drop shipper partners with a supplier or manufacturer who handles the storage, packaging, and shipping of products directly to the customers. The primary role of income seekers revolves around marketing, customer service, and optimizing their e-commerce store. As the store gains traction, it can generate passive income through product sales and repeat customers. Click to continue reading and see 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best Materials ETFs20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202312 Stocks That Will Double In 2023Disclosure.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.48 billion, up 3.78% from the year-ago period.KO's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.63 per share and revenue of $45.01 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.05% and +4.68%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This raises the question is the stock significantly undervalued? This article presents a comprehensive valuation analysis of Incyte, encouraging readers to delve into the details to uncover the intrinsic value of the stock.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with INCY. Click here to check it out. INCY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of INCYIncyte Corp focuses on the discovery and development of small-molecule drugs. Their lead drug, Jakafi, treats two types of rare blood cancer and graft versus host disease. Incyte's other marketed drugs include rheumatoid arthritis treatment Olumiant, and oncology drugs Iclusig, Pemazyre, Tabrecta, and Monjuvi. The firm's first dermatology product, Opzelura, was approved in 2021 for atopic dermatitis and 2022 for vitiligo. Comparing the stock price of $59.35 to the GF Value of $89.6, it appears that Incyte's stock may be significantly undervalued.Unveiling Incyte (INCY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. It provides a fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on our analysis, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) appears to be significantly undervalued. The stock's future return is likely to be much higher than its business growth due to its undervaluation.Unveiling Incyte (INCY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Incyte has a cash-to-debt ratio of 86.14, which is better than 75.23% of companies in the Biotechnology industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Incyte at 10 out of 10, indicating strong financial health.Story continuesUnveiling Incyte (INCY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. Incyte has been profitable 6 over the past 10 years. It had a revenue of $3.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.63 over the past twelve months. Its operating margin is 12.64%, ranking better than 84.55% of companies in the Biotechnology industry. Overall, the profitability of Incyte is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. Incyte's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 61.12% of companies in the Biotechnology industry. However, Incyte's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 2.4%, ranking worse than 53.25% of companies in the Biotechnology industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. Incyte's ROIC is 13.18 while its WACC is 7.63.Unveiling Incyte (INCY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) stock appears to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is strong, and its profitability is fair.

This announcement comes after a three-month delay due to the need for additional data review.Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer characterized by scar tissue formation in the bone marrow, leading to severe anemia among other health issues. Ojjaara, a once-daily oral JAK1/JAK2 and activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1) inhibitor, is the only FDA-approved medicine addressing the key manifestations of the disease: anemia, constitutional symptoms, and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). It is applicable to both newly diagnosed and previously treated patients.GSK acquired Ojjaara through a $1.9 billion purchase of Sierra Oncology (NASDAQ:SRRA) in April 2022. The drug already had positive phase 3 trial data at the time of acquisition. By August 2022, the FDA had accepted its New Drug Application (NDA), initially assigning a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of June 16, 2023. However, the agency extended this deadline by three months to review recently submitted data.Ojjaara's approval was based on two phase 3 trials, MOMENTUM and SIMPLIFY-1. The latter was designed to evaluate the drug's efficacy and safety against Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY)'s Jakafi in myelofibrosis patients who had not received prior JAK inhibitor treatment. Regulators evaluated safety and efficacy results based on a subset of patients with anemia.Despite having similar action mechanisms to Incyte’s Jakafi and Bristol Myers’ Inrebic, Ojjaara differentiates itself by inhibiting the ACVR1 protein, which GSK believes leads to its effect on anemia. A late-stage clinical trial revealed that a significantly higher percentage of myelofibrosis patients receiving Ojjaara experienced a 50% or greater reduction in disease-related symptoms. The drug also appeared to improve other health measures such as reducing spleen size and the need for blood transfusions.Story continues“With momelotinib we have the potential to establish a new standard of care for myelofibrosis patients with anemia,” said Ruben Mesa, executive director at the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center.The broad labeling and apparent effects on anemia could make Ojjaara a meaningful competitor to Jakafi, according to Andrew Berens, an analyst at Leerink Partners. Last year, Incyte reported $2.4 billion in net revenue from Jakafi, which is also approved to treat two other diseases.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Ingersoll Rand IR and Weyerhaeuser WY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:To Center Stage for the Fed: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, central banks take center stage.Five of the 10 central banks with the most heavily traded currencies — including the U.S. Fed — hold rate-setting meetings.Plus, we hear from a swathe of emerging market central banks.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) On Wednesday, the FOMC meeting breaks up. Fresh economic projections will be a key focus.The European Central Bank (ECB) just signaled an end to its aggressive rate hikes, cheering markets. Now it's the turn of the world's most important central bank.The Fed is widely expected to leave its key rate in a 5.25-5.50% range when it concludes a meeting on Wednesday.Latest inflation numbers were slightly stronger than expected, but that has done little to bolster the case for an imminent rate increase.Whether it's the United States or Europe, investors suspect this global rate tightening cycle is nearing an end.That doesn't mean worries about potentially sticky inflation will keep rates higher for longer.And a hawkish tone from Fed Chief Jerome Powell could keep U.S. Treasury yields elevated, dulling the allure of stocks further but supporting the dollar.(2) On Thursday, we hear from Sweden's Riksbank, the U.K.'s Bank of England, and Norway's central bank.Interest rate decisions in the U.K., Scandinavia and Switzerland will give clues on whether these northern European economies can withstand any more monetary tightening.Story continuesSweden's Riksbank is seen hiking by 25 basis points to 4.0%, despite mounting economic pain with output shrinking, a weak currency and above-target inflation despite a decline to 4.7% in August.Also on Thursday, the Bank of England is tipped to hike for the 15th consecutive meeting, taking benchmark borrowing costs to 5.5%. Even as headline inflation falls as home prices drop, a significant minority of economists expect a further hike this year.Norway's central bank is also expected to nudge benchmark borrowing costs higher, following a 25 bps rise in August to 4.0%.Money market bets on whether Switzerland will raise, or hold at 1.75%, are evenly split.(3) On Friday, Sept. 22nd, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) steps up.Recent comments by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda set a fire under Japan's government bond market, sending benchmark yields soaring above 0.7% for the first time in almost a decade.The spark was a sudden hawkish tilt: Only weeks after doubling the 10-year yield ceiling to 1%, Ueda was talking about the possible end of negative short-term rates by year-end.The BoJ policy decision and news conference on Sept. 22nd has become crucial: first, to find out if another policy tweak is underway, and then, to see whether Ueda clarifies his position after judging the market's reaction.Some surprised BoJ watchers hypothesize that his shift was brought about by the yen's slide to a 10-month trough at 147.875 per dollar, which started to worry Japan's Ministry of Finance.But deeds rather than words may be necessary to halt the decline: After a rebound, the yen is back languishing around 147.30.(4) Wednesday, the Banco do Brasil meets. Thursday for Turkey &amp; South Africa.The push and pull factors on central banks are nowhere more visible than in emerging markets.Much of Latin America, which delivered quick and big on hikes in the last tightening cycle, is now firmly in easing mode.Brazil's policy-makers meeting on Wednesday are expected to stick to their pledge of 50 bps-per-meeting cuts to reduce the benchmark currently at 13.25%.But for Turkey's central bank, convening on Thursday, the only way is up.Grappling to put monetary policy back on an orthodox track after years of President Tayyip Erdogan pushing for lower rates despite soaring inflation, analysts see policy- makers lifting the benchmark to 35% by year-end from 25% now.South Africa will keep rates steady at 8.25% at its Thursday meeting to curb the impact of fuel price inflation. Egypt and Taiwan central banks meet the same day.(5) Many European PMIs are contracting.August was the month Europe's consumers finally caved.The services sector fell into contraction for the first time this year, compared with 13 straight months of shrinking activity for manufacturing.One sub-50 reading doesn't scream disaster, but the downturn was much deeper than many anticipated. It sounded alarm bells, knocking as much as 1% off the euro at one point on the day of release.Activity across the broader economy has withered and economists believe a Eurozone recession is rapidly becoming inevitable, particularly given deteriorating business activity.There is hope, however, that the factory sector might be past the worst of the downturn, and flash Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys on Sept. 22 may confirm that.But with consumers feeling the pain of high interest rates and inflation, recovery in Europe's services sector might be a more distant prospect.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksHere are three large-cap picks with Momentum scores of A.(1) Intuitive Surgical:This is a $303 stock in the Medical Instruments industry.

You can skip our comprehensive analysis and proceed directly to the 5 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 2023.Over the past decade, individuals with net worth ranging from $2 million to over $50 million have progressively gravitated towards Citizenship by Investment (CBI) programs. Motivated by aspirations for improved mobility, advantageous tax arrangements, and an elevated lifestyle encompassing better education and expanded civil liberties, these programs have surged in popularity.By introducing CBI programs, several smaller countries have strengthened their financial independence and improved their sovereign equity, thereby reducing public debt and reliance on debt financing from supranational organizations.The Allure of Investment Immigration: Embracing Global ProspectsThis rise in interest towards acquiring second citizenship or an alternate nationality holds particular allure for entrepreneurs, especially those classified as High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs). Such a venture opens the gateway to previously untapped business prospects, providing access to emerging markets and highly lucrative opportunities. By exploring these thriving industries and fostering global connections, entrepreneurs can substantially bolster the resilience and prosperity of their ventures.As reported by Investment Migration Council, in 2020, a historical high of 6,705 Americans chose to renounce their citizenship, but this figure notably decreased to 2,426 in 2022. The decline in numbers might partially be attributed to the closure of U.S. embassies during the pandemic. According to a survey conducted by Greenback Expat Tax Services, which polled U.S. expatriates residing in 121 countries, approximately 1 out of every 4 American expatriates is contemplating or actively planning to relinquish their U.S. citizenship. Critics of American tax legislation argue that the country's global income tax compliance and disclosure regulations are excessively burdensome and restrictive.Story continuesWith investors increasingly recognizing the value and potential benefits of a diversified passport portfolio, governments of countries offering investment migration programs also acknowledge the significance of customized immigration policies in attracting investors.On August 15, Bloomberg reported that the European countries offering golden visas have collectively attracted approximately €25 billion (equivalent to $27.1 billion) in foreign direct investment through these schemes over the last ten years. Portugal has stood out as a significant recipient, securing around €6.8 billion (equivalent to $7.3 billion) during this period.HNWI's Preferred Destinations: Tax HavensMany countries with CBI programs provide tax-friendly environments, featuring low or zero-tax regimes for foreign-sourced income, capital gains, and other financial gains. HNWIs can leverage these tax advantages to optimize their global tax position, reducing their tax liabilities significantly. Moreover, some countries grant tax exemptions or reduced personal income tax rates to their new citizens, providing substantial tax savings.Additionally, becoming a citizen of a tax-efficient country can lead to exemptions from wealth and inheritance taxes, preserving family wealth for future generations. Individuals can avoid double taxation and create a financially advantageous global lifestyle by strategically utilizing dual citizenship and tax treaties between nations.Given the substantial wealth and strategic business relocations undertaken by HNWIs and entrepreneurs via CBI programs, several companies specialize in providing bespoke solutions and navigating tax intricacies. Distinguished companies acclaimed for their services include Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR).Intuit Inc.

On August 3, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) successfully acquired Honu HR, Inc., doing business as Sora (Sora). Sora is a low-code intelligent workflow automation and data integration solution designed to streamline various business applications, including HR and IT systems, to deliver a more efficient and user-friendly experience for employees, business owners, and HR professionals.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

Vanuatu and Cape Verde were not included in these lists, so we conducted independent research. The country with the lowest tax rate was assigned the highest rank.In a similar vein, political stability and government effectiveness rankings were informed by The World Bank index, while human development values drew from the United Nations Development Program index. This data was instrumental in crafting our distinct ranking score against each metric.Subsequently, we determined the best Citizenship by Investment programs in 2023 by averaging their placements on these indexes, with a lower average score signifying a more favorable ranking.Please Note:Cape Verde utilizes a progressive personal income tax structure, ranging from 16.5% to 27.5%. We ranked it by calculating its average rate.In cases where multiple countries had similar average scores, their ranking was determined by their tax friendliness score as a decisive factor.We consulted various sources such as Premier Consultancy Group, Global Citizen Solution, IMI Daily, Nomad Capitalist, Immigrant Invest, and Best Citizenships to ascertain investment costs.20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202320.

In fact, the S&amp;P 500 is down 1% since August, in line with its average 1.1% monthly decline since 1928. Of course, many investors are spooked, unsure of how to invest in an economy on shaky ground. All while other investors seek out some of the most undervalued safe stocks on the market, including the seven below.Amplify Energy (AMPY)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAmplify Energy (NYSE:AMPY) kicked off September with a bang, climbing 15%. However, there’s still room to run for this oil and gas company. For one, its free cash flow is sufficient and steady, hovering at or above $40 million for the past three years. Two, not only does Amplify have plenty of cash on hand to grow or return value to shareholders but it has also trimmed down debt substantially. That alone is notable, especially when most oil and gas firms remain debt-heavy. For example, the industry’s average debt-to-equity ratio is usually around 0.5, but Amplify’s is below 0.40.Finally, Amplify’s valuation ratios indicate the company remains undervalued despite its September surge. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is only 0.70. But, most appealing to value investors, Amplify’s price-to-book ratio is well below 1.00 – meaning its share price doesn’t match its net asset value. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSharkNinja (SN)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos. Strong Buy Stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockSharkNinja (NYSE:SN) snuck onto the stock market in July and is just beginning to capture investor attention. The consumer discretionary stock produces and sells a range of home and personal appliances like ice cream makers, blenders, and hair dryers. Most notably, its recent performance in a down economy is particularly impressive. Sales have risen 20% annually since 2008, and management expects to end the year with $4 billion in revenue. This week, SharkNinja got its first Wall Street analyst rating from investment banking firm Jefferies. Analysts at the firm rated SharkNinja a Buy and assigned a $67 per-share target to the stock. That’s still 60% above today’s pricing, despite recent stock gains, meaning there’s still upside for latecomers. Story continuesBerry Global Group (BERY)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Plastic packaging might not be the most exciting stock prospect, but it’s the reason Berry Global Group (NYSE:BERY) is a safe, undervalued stock. The company produces plastic packaging across consumer, engineering, healthcare, and hygiene sectors. If you take prescription medication, chances are high that Berry produced the bottle. Berry is also forward-thinking for those concerned about environmental sustainability, generating innovation in carbon reduction and waste management spaces. That commitment to a sustainable future is evidenced by Berry’s “A” rating on environmental initiatives, including a “commitment to reducing the environmental impact of packaging and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.” Berry’s in-demand, pervasive products ensure its stickiness in global markets, while its sustainable innovations ensure the company can adapt to changing expectations and remain viable long-term. The company trades at a 0.57 price-to-sales ratio and an equally low 11.82 price-to-earnings ratio.Intuit (INTU)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comTax time is approaching, making Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) a decidedly safe stock — especially with more than 80% of Americans filing taxes digitally. Intuit Inc. is a prominent software company specializing in financial software, notably tax and accounting products, including its well-known product, TurboTax. In addition to broad-based tax solutions, the company stands to benefit from the swelling number of gig workers and side hustlers. That market is exploding, expected to hit $455 billion by 2030, and Intuit’s tax solutions uniquely target this demographic.   In its latest earnings report, Intuit reported a net income of $89 million, or 32 cents per share, compared to the net loss of $56 million, or 20 cents per share, in the same period the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share stood at $1.66. The company’s revenue surged by 12% to $2.71 billion from $2.4 billion year-over-year. Despite strong recent performance and relatively high per-share pricing, analysts affirm its Buy rating and indicate the stock remains undervalued. SK Telecom (SKM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comTelecom stocks tend to be the safest around but usually trade close to fair value. Telecom stocks rarely swell to overblown pricing but, at the same time, don’t often dip into undervalued territory. SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM) is an exception.SKM is a South Korean telecom company, the largest in the country. Still, it continues innovating in the face of significant market saturation. The company services just under 50% of the South Korean wireless market. But SKM is also pouring cash into artificial intelligence initiatives, investing $100 million into a Google-backed (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) multilingual language model startup. SKM’s drive towards innovation makes the company undervalued based on long-term prospects, but it’s also materially undervalued today. The stock trades at a 0.92 price-to-book ratio and a 10.14 price-to-earnings ratio. The wireless telecom industry’s average price-to-earnings ratio is more than 3x SKM’s, at 30.25 – making this safe stock decidedly undervalued. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) may not seem overvalued on its own, but it certainly is compared to the broad artificial intelligence sector, considering its long-term potential. In its second-quarter 2023 earnings report, AMD reported non-GAAP earnings of 58 cents per share, exceeding analysts’ expectations. Revenues for the quarter amounted to $5.36 billion. That beat by a slim 0.67%, but AMD’s future remains bright. Management has an optimistic outlook for the third quarter of 2023. In the report, AMD expects revenues to reach $5.7 billion. That’s a 2.5% year-over-year growth and a 6.5% sequential increase. Consistent, small gains indicate stability, which is critical in an emerging market like AI. AMD’s strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of French AI Software Company Mipsology, demonstrate its commitment to enhancing its capabilities in artificial intelligence. The company has been actively focusing on AI, including introducing a new GPU for artificial intelligence in June.AMD trades at 39x earnings, which seems high, but is undervalued compared to direct competitor Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which trades at a whopping 108.70. Danaher Corporation (DHR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) specializes in manufacturing scientific instruments and consumables, operating across three segments: life sciences, diagnostics, and environmental and applied solutions. Although the stock remained relatively flat year-to-date, underperforming the market, recent financials suggest hidden upside potential and undervalued status.In its most recent earnings report, Danaher exceeded analysts’ expectations by reporting quarterly earnings of $2.05 per share. That’s a tad lower than last year’s period, which is understandable given today’s economic state. However, Danaher beat the estimated $2 per share and posted $7.16 billion in revenue. The beat suggests the company can adapt to shifting economic winds.August brought a significant development as Danaher announced its plan to acquire Abcam plc (NASDAQ:ABCM), a leading global supplier of protein consumables. The move will streamline Danaher’s life sciences division, improving operational efficiency over time and increasing the company’s margins. The stock also offers a modest 0.45% dividend yield. Although the yield isn’t groundbreaking, it further reinforces the company’s financial position and commitment to shareholders. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Stryker (SYK) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to SYK for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Stryker's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Stryker's main business drivers.Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.Orthopaedic products primarily include implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries.MedSurg products consists of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability) as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.Neurotechnology &amp; Spine division includes both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. These includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques; traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products; and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.Spinal implant product offering includes cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.It is important to note here that effective from Dec 31, 2021, Stryker has updated its reportable business segments to align to its new internal reporting structure.Story continues2022 at a GlanceStryker’s full-year revenues totaled $18.45 billion, up 7.8% from the previous year. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.034 increased 2.8% from the previous year.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Stryker ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $4,084.98, or a gain of 308.50%, as of September 19, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 158.10% and the price of gold increased 35.89% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for SYK.Stryker exited second-quarter 2023 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. The momentum is expected to continue into the second half of 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company’s guidance for earnings and revenues appears encouraging. A solid solvency position is a plus. However, inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to plague Stryker. Stiff competition in the MedTech space remains a woe. Contraction in both gross and operating margin is a woe.The stock is up 6.15% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 13 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

A Comprehensive Guide,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-davita-dva-value-really-163220012.html,1695141140,STORY,"['DVA', 'VALU']","[DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA) has recently seen a daily gain of 2.16%, and a 3-month gain of 5.17%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 5.03, the question arises: is the stock modestly undervalued? This article provides an in-depth valuation analysis of DaVita (NYSE:DVA), encouraging readers to delve into the financial intricacies of the company.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DVA. Click here to check it out. DVA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVADaVita Inc is the leading provider of dialysis services in the United States, with a market share exceeding 35% by both patients and clinics. The company operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, treating over 240,000 patients globally each year. The majority of DaVita's sales are at government reimbursement rates, primarily Medicare, while the remainder comes from commercial insurers. Despite commercial insurers representing only about 10% of the U.S. patients treated, they generate nearly all of the profits for DaVita's U.S. dialysis business.Unveiling DaVita (DVA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideSummarizing GF ValueThe GF Value represents the intrinsic value of a stock, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.DaVita's stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued, according to GuruFocus Value calculation. At its current price of $101.93 per share and a market cap of $9.30 billion, the stock is likely to yield a higher long-term return than its business growth due to its relative undervaluation.Unveiling DaVita (DVA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial StrengthAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent loss. DaVita's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03 is weaker than 92.84% of 656 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry, indicating poor financial strength.Story continuesUnveiling DaVita (DVA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent long-term profitability, poses less risk. DaVita has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 10.73%, ranking better than 73.44% of 655 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.One of the most crucial factors in the valuation of a company is its growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. DaVita's average annual revenue growth is 17.8%, ranking better than 72.08% of 573 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another method of determining its profitability. A higher ROIC than WACC implies that the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, DaVita's ROIC has been 6.3, and its cost of capital has been 5.31.Unveiling DaVita (DVA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of DaVita is estimated to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 56.02% of 523 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.

The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its continued focus on research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. However, concerns over forex volatility and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 8.4% compared with the 16.3% rise of the industry and 14.6% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical technology company has a market capitalization of $76.75 billion. It projects 9.9% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. BD has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.7% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Continued Focus on R&amp;D: A significant element of BD’s strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development, raising our optimism. New product development requires significant investment in R&amp;D, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. BD’s focus on its R&amp;D activities is enabling the company to develop new products and launch them. This, in turn, is enabling BD to solidify its foothold and beat the competition.Product Launches: We are upbeat about BD’s slew of product launches in recent times. In June, the company announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new automated instrument, BD FACSDuet Premium Sample Preparation System.In May, BD announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit designed to reinforce compliance with infection prevention guidelines and simplify nursing workflow.Strong Q3 Results: BD’s solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company registered solid top-line and bottom-line results, along with improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by the majority of its segments and both geographic regions were also recorded. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also seen.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: BD, being a global company, faces significant competition from a wide range of companies, including large medical device companies with multiple product lines. Some of these companies may have greater resources and may be more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets or product lines. Non-traditional entrants, such as technology companies, are also entering the healthcare industry with resources.Forex Volatility: BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD reports with respect to its operations outside the United States may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Any exchange rate hedging activities in which BD engages may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Estimate TrendBD is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.3% north to $12.23.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $5.02 billion, suggesting a 5.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

563,1ed6e424-5941-35c1-b127-5edf83d70c12,DVA,2023-09-20,Inogen (INGN) Completes Buyout Deal to Expand Product Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inogen-ingn-completes-buyout-deal-153100093.html,1695137460,STORY,"['ITGR', 'DVA']","[Inogen, Inc. INGN recently completed the acquisition of Physio-Assist SAS. Following the close of the transaction (earlier announced on Jul 13, 2023), Inogen owns Physio-Assist and will now market the Simeox device outside of the United States.Inogen will also continue with the ongoing preparations for FDA submission.The latest buyout is expected to expand Inogen’s global Respiratory Care presence by addressing a growing and underserved airway clearance market opportunity.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionSimeox has been cleared under the CE mark in the European Union and is currently being sold in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Inogen is expected to leverage its commercial infrastructure and capabilities to continue marketing the device in these geographies while pursuing U.S. regulatory approvals. The acquisition will likely provide access to a large and growing market opportunity with 400,000 to 490,000 patients suffering from bronchiectasis in the United States.Inogen’s management believes that Physio-Assist's Simeox product will likely provide a differentiated and clinically-proven airway clearance technology. This is expected to support its strategy to become a multi-portfolio global respiratory care company.Financial ImplicationsThe buyout is expected to be immaterial to Inogen’s 2023 revenues but immediately accretive to gross margin.Given the clinical and commercial investment required to obtain the FDA’s clearance and launch Simeox in the United States, the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings beginning in 2027.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Data Bridge Market Research, the global respiratory care devices market was valued at $18.40 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $36.66 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 9%. Factors like the increased incidence of respiratory disorders, the high prevalence of cigarette smoking and rising levels of pollution are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the acquisition seems to have been timed well.Notable DevelopmentLast month, Inogen announced its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a robust year-over-year uptick in rental revenues and domestic business-to-business sales. During the quarter, Inogen introduced Rove 6 in the United States, a portable oxygen concentrator now with an eight-year expected service life.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 78.7% in the past year against the industry’s 0.3% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 14.6% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Inogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

DVA has been gaining from its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and the acquisition of dialysis centers are expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding dependence on commercial payers and integration risks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 5.7% against the 7.6% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.5% growth in the said time frame.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $8.98 billion. The company projects 12.7% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 21.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care, as of Jun 30, 2023, the company had approximately 64,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses, which own and operate dialysis centers, as well as other ancillary services, is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.As of Jun 30, 2023, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 248,000 patients at 3,056 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,703 were U.S. centers while 353 were located across 11 other countries. In the second quarter of 2023, the company opened a total of 10 new dialysis centers in the United States. It also acquired two dialysis centers and opened two dialysis centers outside the United States in the same period.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: DaVita’s solid second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and dialysis patient service revenues. An increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments was also seen. The gross margin expansion bodes well for the stock.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Integration Risks: DaVita’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. The company may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions or expand into new business models, which may affect its operations.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 7.8% north to $7.22.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $3 billion, suggesting a 1.9% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are McKesson Corporation MCK, HealthEquity, Inc. HQY and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.McKesson, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 10.7%.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.DaVita HealthCare and Chemed are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that DVA's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.DVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.62, while CHE has a forward P/E of 25.63. We also note that DVA has a PEG ratio of 1.08. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CHE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.95.Another notable valuation metric for DVA is its P/B ratio of 7.39. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CHE has a P/B of 8.11.Based on these metrics and many more, DVA holds a Value grade of A, while CHE has a Value grade of C.Story continuesDVA sticks out from CHE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that DVA is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

567,485061bd-28c3-3943-94ea-2ed2fd11b58d,WHR,2023-09-20,What Makes Whirlpool (WHR) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-whirlpool-whr-buy-stock-160005895.html,1695052805,STORY,['WHR'],"[Investors might want to bet on Whirlpool (WHR), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Whirlpool basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Whirlpool, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for WhirlpoolFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and other appliances is expected to earn $16.47 per share, which is a change of -16.1% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Whirlpool. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Whirlpool to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's focus on reducing carbon emissions from heating and cooling buildings, which contributes to around 15% of global carbon emissions, has positioned it as a leader in the fight against climate change.On Tuesday, Trane's CEO, Dave Regnery, highlighted several technologies that are contributing to this effort. High-efficiency chillers and thermal energy storage systems are among these innovations. These systems function like large-scale ice makers, allowing building managers to produce ice during off-peak electricity hours and use it for cooling during the day. This technology not only reduces operating costs but also eases pressure on the electricity grid by reducing peak demand.Trane has also been employing building automation technology. The integration of thermal management into commercial buildings has proved beneficial for the company, helping offset any economic downturns. Despite flat HVAC markets in Europe, Trane's commercial HVAC business saw a high-teens percentage increase in the second quarter.Financial analysts predict steady growth for Trane in the coming years. Annual sales are expected to rise between 5% and 6%, accompanied by an over 10% increase in annual earnings. Trane's shares currently trade at about 21.8 times estimated earnings over the next year, higher than the S&amp;P 500 average of around 18.4 times. This robust growth has led to a higher-than-average valuation for Trane.However, this higher valuation has made Wall Street hesitant, with only about 36% of analysts recommending a Buy rating on the stock, compared to the S&amp;P 500 average Buy-rating ratio of approximately 55%. The average analyst price target for Trane's shares is around $216, roughly $13 more than its current trading value.Story continuesAs of the most recent Tuesday trading session, Trane's shares have seen an increase of about 21% year to date and approximately 28% over the past year.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

GGG is gaining from strength in the Industrial and Process segments, and investments in product innovation, despite increasing costs and forex woes. The company is also facing weakness in the Contractor segment due to lower demand in the home center channel, slowing construction markets in China and softer demand in the North America pro paint channel.Key Factors Driving GGGBusiness Strength: Graco’s Industrial segment is benefiting from robust activity in the alternative energy, electronics and battery end markets. Increasing orders in the liquid finishing and sealant and adhesive businesses also bode well. GGG expects the segment to benefit from increasing backlogs in powder equipment and systems in the second half of 2023. The Process segment is gaining from continued sales growth in vehicle service, automatic lubrication and semiconductor.Strong price realization, along with favorable product and channel mix, are aiding Graco’s margin performance. The company’s gross margin increased 300 basis points in the first six months of 2023.Investments in Product Innovation: Investments in capacity expansion and product innovation should drive Graco’s growth. In 2023, the company anticipates capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million, including $130 million for facility expansion projects at its Minnesota, South Dakota, Switzerland and Romania facilities. As for innovation, the company introduced hot melt adhesive dispense system, the InvisiPac HM10 and electric-powered airless gun and Ultra QuickShotearlier in 2023.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first six months of 2023, Graco paid out dividends worth $79 million to its shareholders, up 10.7% year over year. It repurchased common stocks worth $7.8 million in the same period. In December 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 11.9% to 23.5 cents per share.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain GGG stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesGraco Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Ingersoll Rand IR and Weyerhaeuser WY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:To Center Stage for the Fed: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, central banks take center stage.Five of the 10 central banks with the most heavily traded currencies — including the U.S. Fed — hold rate-setting meetings.Plus, we hear from a swathe of emerging market central banks.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) On Wednesday, the FOMC meeting breaks up. Fresh economic projections will be a key focus.The European Central Bank (ECB) just signaled an end to its aggressive rate hikes, cheering markets. Now it's the turn of the world's most important central bank.The Fed is widely expected to leave its key rate in a 5.25-5.50% range when it concludes a meeting on Wednesday.Latest inflation numbers were slightly stronger than expected, but that has done little to bolster the case for an imminent rate increase.Whether it's the United States or Europe, investors suspect this global rate tightening cycle is nearing an end.That doesn't mean worries about potentially sticky inflation will keep rates higher for longer.And a hawkish tone from Fed Chief Jerome Powell could keep U.S. Treasury yields elevated, dulling the allure of stocks further but supporting the dollar.(2) On Thursday, we hear from Sweden's Riksbank, the U.K.'s Bank of England, and Norway's central bank.Interest rate decisions in the U.K., Scandinavia and Switzerland will give clues on whether these northern European economies can withstand any more monetary tightening.Story continuesSweden's Riksbank is seen hiking by 25 basis points to 4.0%, despite mounting economic pain with output shrinking, a weak currency and above-target inflation despite a decline to 4.7% in August.Also on Thursday, the Bank of England is tipped to hike for the 15th consecutive meeting, taking benchmark borrowing costs to 5.5%. Even as headline inflation falls as home prices drop, a significant minority of economists expect a further hike this year.Norway's central bank is also expected to nudge benchmark borrowing costs higher, following a 25 bps rise in August to 4.0%.Money market bets on whether Switzerland will raise, or hold at 1.75%, are evenly split.(3) On Friday, Sept. 22nd, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) steps up.Recent comments by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda set a fire under Japan's government bond market, sending benchmark yields soaring above 0.7% for the first time in almost a decade.The spark was a sudden hawkish tilt: Only weeks after doubling the 10-year yield ceiling to 1%, Ueda was talking about the possible end of negative short-term rates by year-end.The BoJ policy decision and news conference on Sept. 22nd has become crucial: first, to find out if another policy tweak is underway, and then, to see whether Ueda clarifies his position after judging the market's reaction.Some surprised BoJ watchers hypothesize that his shift was brought about by the yen's slide to a 10-month trough at 147.875 per dollar, which started to worry Japan's Ministry of Finance.But deeds rather than words may be necessary to halt the decline: After a rebound, the yen is back languishing around 147.30.(4) Wednesday, the Banco do Brasil meets. Thursday for Turkey &amp; South Africa.The push and pull factors on central banks are nowhere more visible than in emerging markets.Much of Latin America, which delivered quick and big on hikes in the last tightening cycle, is now firmly in easing mode.Brazil's policy-makers meeting on Wednesday are expected to stick to their pledge of 50 bps-per-meeting cuts to reduce the benchmark currently at 13.25%.But for Turkey's central bank, convening on Thursday, the only way is up.Grappling to put monetary policy back on an orthodox track after years of President Tayyip Erdogan pushing for lower rates despite soaring inflation, analysts see policy- makers lifting the benchmark to 35% by year-end from 25% now.South Africa will keep rates steady at 8.25% at its Thursday meeting to curb the impact of fuel price inflation. Egypt and Taiwan central banks meet the same day.(5) Many European PMIs are contracting.August was the month Europe's consumers finally caved.The services sector fell into contraction for the first time this year, compared with 13 straight months of shrinking activity for manufacturing.One sub-50 reading doesn't scream disaster, but the downturn was much deeper than many anticipated. It sounded alarm bells, knocking as much as 1% off the euro at one point on the day of release.Activity across the broader economy has withered and economists believe a Eurozone recession is rapidly becoming inevitable, particularly given deteriorating business activity.There is hope, however, that the factory sector might be past the worst of the downturn, and flash Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys on Sept. 22 may confirm that.But with consumers feeling the pain of high interest rates and inflation, recovery in Europe's services sector might be a more distant prospect.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksHere are three large-cap picks with Momentum scores of A.(1) Intuitive Surgical:This is a $303 stock in the Medical Instruments industry.

In August 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 7% to $1.40 per share. Simultaneously, the company’s board approved a new $5 billion buyback program. In the first half of 2023, the company bought back shares worth $750 million. In 2023, Illinois Tool expects to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.Bullish 2023 Outlook: Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Illinois Tool’s bullish guidance for 2023 sparks optimism. The company expects organic growth of 3-5% for the current year. For 2023, ITW expects revenues to increase 2-4% year over year. In the second quarter of 2023, the company raised its earnings guidance to $9.55-$9.95 per share compared with $9.45-$9.85 per share anticipated earlier. Illinois Tool anticipates an operating margin of 24.5-25.5%, with approximately 100-basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain ITW stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

579,273ddb14-0762-328d-b40b-9a82b9b8a5e6,GE,2023-09-20,10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-3d-printing-additive-151019388.html,1695136219,STORY,"['GE', 'ADSK', 'ALGN', 'TRMB', 'AAM-PB', 'APO', 'APO-PA', 'ANSS', 'LECO', 'XRAY']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks to buy. If you want to skip our introduction to why 3D manufacturing is one of the most important industries today, then check out 5 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.3D printing is one of the most disruptive technologies in the world today. It has allowed companies and enthusiasts to virtually create any product that they like out of thin air, whilst doing so otherwise would require large machines and hefty investments in fabrication equipment. This enables companies to rapidly build out parts and verify their engineering and design even if the fabrication is done only for testing purposes and mass production will take place through traditional machines.3D printers and additive manufacturing as an industry have moved forward quite rapidly over the course of the past decade or so. They are now used to manufacture some of the most complex engineering products in the world, which can withstand significant forces. Industrial equipment and products manufacturer General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)'s Italian division Avio Aero manufactures jet engine turbine blades with 3D printing, and these end up spinning thousands of times in minute at  unimaginable forces inside a jet engine.For the ancient observer, the process of manufacturing a 3D printed jet engine blade would be nothing short of magic. It involves an electron beam welding together thin layers of metal to create a product that is insusceptible to hairline or microscopic cracks. Additionally, since the machines are capable of building robust components, they can also make other components such as sensor housings. Talking numbers, by using 3D printing to manufacture ""tons"" of components for the 787 aircraft, a Boeing supplier believes that the company can save as much as $3 million in costs over the long term.While $3 million in cost savings for a jet that costs hundreds of million of dollars might seem trivial, the fact that there are other methods to fabricate complex products which are fundamentally different from existing processes shows that there is significant room for innovation on the product front and for markets at the supply end. This potential seems to be on the mind of companies as well, since a study from Ernst &amp; Young (EY) shows that out of 900 businesses surveyed in 2016 and 2019 each, the percentage that are applying additive manufacturing technology in their business operations process grew by more than 2.5x while those that did not intend to apply dropped by 3.7x. These are strong numbers for a small time period and the data also reveals that the highest percentage of business that do use 3D manufacturing are in China and South Korea.Story continuesAnother key benefit of 3D printing is the ability to produce simple products cheaply. A variety of goods, such as skateboards, goggles, and even football helmets are made by additive manufacturing. A key advantage of this is that the supply chains for these products can be easily set up domestically in the U.S. and create more jobs since traditionally such goods are imported from Asian countries where the cost of labor and other mass production inputs are lower.However, even though the potential of 3D printing is immense, the fact still remains that printers are not widely used for mass production. Mass production is the backbone of consumerism and capitalism as it allows firms to churn out billions of products each year with ease and improve the standard of living of consumers. One firm that mass produces products with 3D printing is Sonova. It makes hearing aids through additive manufacturing, and the firm claims that the technology has allowed it to produce hundreds of thousands of customized hearing pieces in a year.Finally, any discussion about 3D printing would be incomplete without SpaceX particularly as aerospace is one of the hottest topics in the media these days. SpaceX was one of the first companies to 3D print a rocket engine, as the firm revealed a thruster for its Dragon spacecraft built through additive manufacturing back in 2013. Another rocket company that is quite agile when it comes to blending the latest manufacturing technology in its production process is Relativity Space. The firm is aiming to compete with SpaceX in the crucial area of rocket reusability and it is designing the Terran R medium lift vehicle (equivalent to SpaceX's Falcon 9). This rocket aims to be fully reusable and manufactured by 3D printing.As to what's happening in the printer industry right now, here's what the executives of Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM) had to say during the firm's latest earnings conference call:Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $53.3 million, a very strong 29% growth over the first quarter of 2023. As you’ll recall, we entered the year with a questionable outlook on the demand side as macro pressures with in our industry. And we certainly felt that in the first quarter.There was a continuation of that softness into the start of the second quarter. However, quarter momentum really began to pick up, and we finished the quarter with strength. While there’s still some element of caution in the environment, we’re very encouraged by the recent customer activity that led to our second quarter results. This momentum gives us confidence in the early signs of a recovery and also validates feedback we’ve been receiving from customers that we would see an uptick in orders as we progress through 2023. In combination with this improved customer demand profile in a variety of near-term growth opportunities, we feel very good about the second half of 2023, and we’re reaffirming our 2023 revenue guidance. Meanwhile, the DM team has been laser-focused on something we have full control of, reducing our cost structure.Today we'll look at some top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks and the top picks in this piece are Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK).10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To BuyRuslans Golenkovs/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the top 3D printing and additive manufacturing stocks, we used our previous coverage and Ark Invest's 3D Printing ETF and ranked the top 30 companies that are traded on U.S. exchanges through the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q2 2023.

580,974af2cf-535c-3f47-8b59-5db0c337a933,GE,2023-09-20,3 Top Stocks From the Flourishing Diversified Operations Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stocks-flourishing-diversified-143800892.html,1695134280,STORY,"['ITT', 'GE', 'MMM']","[The Zacks Diversified Operations industry is grappling with reduced demand across several end markets due to lower consumer spending as a result of inflationary pressure. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, the gradual uptick in manufacturing activities signals an improvement in demand for the industry. Easing supply chains and cost-control measures are expected to aid the bottom lines of these companies.Companies like General Electric GE, 3M Company MMM and ITT Inc. ITT are well-placed to capitalize on the buoyancy in the industry. About the IndustryThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry includes companies that operate in various end markets, including oil &amp; gas, industrial, electronics, power, aviation, technology, finance, healthcare, chemical, non-residential construction and transportation. Such companies manufacture and provide equipment and solutions, including bioprocessing products, molecular testing-related products, gas and steam turbines, generators, commercial jet engines and engineered fluid-process equipment. The industry players also provide related services to a large customer base. In addition, a few companies offer services in the agriculture, marine and telecommunications markets and are engaged in providing environmental and safety solutions. The diversified market operators have a vast global presence, with exposure in the United States, Japan, India, China, Canada and other countries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Diversified Operations IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the diversified operations industry.Inflationary Pressure: Companies with exposure to the electronics, healthcare and consumer verticals are experiencing lower demand due to reduced consumer spending as a result of inflationary pressure. Within the electronics division, there is softness, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs. Within the consumer segment, companies are witnessing a decline in home improvement, stationery and office businesses. Given the high inflation levels, consumer spending is likely to remain suppressed through 2023, weighing on the top line of these companies. Reduced demand in the residential end market is also a concern for the industry.Easing Supply-Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply-chain issues should support diversified operations companies’ growth in 2023. Cost-control measures support the margins of the industry participants despite inflationary pressure.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Diversified Operations industry, housed within the broader Zacks Conglomerates sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #113. This rank places it in the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects.

APO.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 High-Flying Majors of the Past 3 Months with Room to GrowWall Street has seen a bull run in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, all three major stock indexes are in positive territory. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have witnessed an impressive rally.However, in the past one and a half months, volatility has returned to U.S. stock markets. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exhibited negative returns during this period. At present, market participants are clueless regarding the near-term movement of U.S. stock markets.The Fed's September FOMC meeting to be held this week is of utmost importance. CME FedWatch is currently showing a 98% probability that the central bank will keep the fed fund rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5%. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized word-by-word to find out the future course of the Fed's monetary policies.Meanwhile, a handful of U.S. corporate giants popped in the past three months defying volatility. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful for investors.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential left for the rest of this year.

582,ca76ac52-3287-318a-9700-dca1856c2179,GE,2023-09-20,Momentum Mondays: Stocks Breaking Out Ahead of the Fed Meeting,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/momentum-mondays-stocks-breaking-ahead-170300244.html,1695056580,STORY,"['VST', 'GE', 'VRT']","[Want to start the week ahead of the pack? Check out ‘Momentum Mondays,’ where I cover the leading breakout stocks in the market, summarize the major events of the week ahead, and prepare investors for profitable trading.Stock Indexes ConsolidatingAfter running up aggressively into August, stock indexes have taken a much-needed breather, trading sideways in a rather wide trading range. This is welcome action, as it shows stocks are correcting over time, rather than price.Furthermore, a consolidation like this indicates that another breakout higher may be in the works. If the S&amp;P 500 can regain the 4500 level, the market should begin a year end rally. Alternatively, it should be noted that we are currently in the weakest period of the year from a seasonality perspective, and if the index loses the 4350 level of support, may see more downside.However, I think investors should continue to look for appealing stocks to buy, as the incredible strength of the market this year leads me to believe there will be another rally into year end.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewWeek AheadThe primary market moving event of this week is the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision meeting on Wednesday. Although it is almost a certainty that the Fed will leave rates unchanged there is still huge anticipation preceding the event.What is even more critical is the press conference after the announcement, where Fed chair Jerome Powell will answer questions, and investors can hopefully decipher what he and the committee may do going forward.As of today, there is a 99% chance that the FOMC will leave rates unchanged, but the November meeting still leaves a possibility for them to raise again. Currently, the market prices the odds of a rate increase in November at 31.3%.Also, on the docket this week are initial jobless claims on Thursday morning. The resiliency of the labor market remains one of the key factors leading interest rate decisions. If employment continues to be robust, investors can expect rates to be higher for longer, but if we start to see cracks in the employment market, there could be a quick pivot to interest rate cuts.Story continuesCME GroupImage Source: CME GroupTrade SetupsI will say that I am currently seeing fewer momentum breakout setups than in prior weeks, indicating that there is some weakness in the market. A handful of leading stocks have broken their bullish patterns and may need some more time before setting up another trade.Nonetheless, there are still some nice trading setups in the market. Additionally, all the stocks I am sharing here today are Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), meaning they have upward trending earnings revisions. A strong earnings revisions trend is one of the strongest leading indicators for a bullish move in stocks.General Electric GE is breaking out from a very tight consolidation on Monday morning. It is already trading above the upper bound of $116, signaling the breakout. Although General Electric hasn’t been an exciting stock for many years, it looks like now may be the time to own it.So long as GE stock doesn’t trade back below the breakout level, it should make a strong move higher over the next few weeks.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAnother stock amid a breakout this morning is AppLovin APP. AppLovin stock has cleared the $43 level and made new YTD highs after drawing in buyers Monday morning. So long as the stock holds above the breakout level it should continue to rally.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewVistra VST is a stock that has been featured on past Momentum Mondays and is setting up for another breakout trade. On Monday morning, it traded above the $33 level indicating a breakout. So long as it doesn’t trade back below that level, it should continue higher.Vistra makes for a nice addition to an investor’s portfolio at the moment because as a utility company, it is a defensive stock. Utilities have led the market over the last couple weeks suggesting market participants are rotating into more defensive stocks. If a more severe sell-off does occur, utility stocks should outperform.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewOne stock that has not yet broken out from its pattern yet is Vertiv VRT. Vertiv has been one of the strongest performing stocks in the market, continuously building and breaking out from bull flags. Often the stocks that lead the market continue to lead so investors would be wise to follow them even after a winning trade, as is evident from Vertiv stock.If VRT can break out above the $38.15 level, it should make another bull run and new all-time highs. Alternatively, if the price trades below the $36 level, the setup is invalid, and investors will want to wait for another opportunity.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewBottom LineThere is always a bull market somewhere! If tech stocks start to roll over, investors can focus on defensive names like utilities. Good traders must always remain flexible and should let price guide them.Of course, even the best trading setups can fail, so investors should keep risk management top of mind, and always stick to the trading plan.

Year to date, all three major stock indexes are in positive territory. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have witnessed an impressive rally.However, in the past one and a half months, volatility has returned to U.S. stock markets. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite exhibited negative returns during this period. At present, market participants are clueless regarding the near-term movement of U.S. stock markets.The Fed’s September FOMC meeting to be held this week is of utmost importance. CME FedWatch is currently showing a 98% probability that the central bank will keep the fed fund rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5%. However, the post-FOMC statement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized word-by-word to find out the future course of the Fed’s monetary policies.Meanwhile, a handful of U.S. corporate giants popped in the past three months defying volatility. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful for investors.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital &gt; $50 billion) with strong potential left for the rest of this year. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days.Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers, thus generating an income stream during a market’s downturn.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the past 30 days. CAT has a current dividend yield of 1.86%.General Electric Co. GE has been benefitting from the strong performance of the Aerospace unit, driven by commercial aerospace strength, significant growth in LEAP engine deliveries and higher defense engine orders.With strength in GE Gas Power services and growth in Grid business and Onshore Wind in North America, there are signs of improvement in GE Vernova (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable).

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, its Investor Class fund ARTRX returned 5.73%, Advisor Class fund APDRX posted a return of 5.78%, and Institutional Class fund APHRX returned 5.83%, compared to a return of 6.18% for the MSCI All Country World Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund highlighted stocks like The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter.

On September 19, 2023, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) stock closed at $142.47 per share. One-month return of The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) was 9.26%, and its shares gained 17.39% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) has a market capitalization of $83.359 billion.Artisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""Among our top detractors were The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), Neste and Aptiv. Progressive is a leading provider of property and casualty insurance in the US. We believe its data and operational advantages position it well to gain profitable market share in personal and commercial auto, and homeowners insurance. While we have been frustrated by the company’s recent financial results, we view current issues as mostly transitory. The first issue is a Florida legislative change to injury liability claims. Specifically, a repeal of “one-way” attorney fees, or insurance companies’ having to pay policyholders’ attorney fees when the insured wins a claim. Under the new law, each party will pay its own legal costs. We view this legislative change as a positive for Progressive longer term, but there has been a rush of new claims before the law goes into effect. The second issue is inflationary cost pressures rising faster than the company’s ability to raise prices. For example, costs for auto claims have been rising due to 1) parts and labor shortages, which lead to pricing pressures, and 2) corresponding longer car rentals. Raising prices to match these rising price pressures is difficult because they need to be approved by state insurance commissions. While we view these issues as transitory longer term, we trimmed the position while we wait to see how these issues play out.""Story continuesThe Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Valero Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Valero Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Valero Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 8.3% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Valero Energy Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$242m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Valero Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Valero Energy , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Valero Energy (VLO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to VLO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Valero Energy's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Valero Energy's main business drivers.San Antonio, TX-based Valero Energy Corporation is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.Moreover, Valero is a leading ethanol producer with 14 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.73 billion gallons per year. The products of the company are sold in the markets of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Latin America. The company’s brand names are carried by around 7,000 outlets.The company organizes its business through three reportable segments, namely, Refining, Ethanol and Renewable Diesel.Refining: The Refining segment was responsible for 92% of the total margin in 2022. It includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation operations. This segment is segregated geographically into the Gulf Coast, mid-continent, West Coast and Northeast regions.Ethanol: The Ethanol segment includes sales of internally produced ethanol and distillers grains. Operations of this segment are geographically located in the Central Plains region of the United States. This segment was responsible for 3.6% of the total margin in 2022.Renewable Diesel: In the first quarter of 2019, the company created this segment. The Renewable Diesel segment incorporates the operations of a consolidated joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel. Notably, the renewable diesel plant is North America’s largest biomass-based diesel plant and it is located in Norco, LA. The segment provided 4.5% of the total margin in 2022, which was supported by the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Valero Energy ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $4,167.52, or a gain of 316.75%, as of September 19, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 158.10% and the price of gold went up 35.89% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for VLO.Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located at the Gulf coast area from where there is easy access to the export facilities. The Gulf coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Notably, Valero intends to quadruple renewable diesel production capacity by 2023. However, the firm’s high debt level can affect its financial flexibility. Also, VLO expects its refining business to remain under pressure. We also expect the adjusted operating income in Valero’s Refining segment to decline significantly this year. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Shares have gained 11.53% over the past four weeks and there have been 8 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

These stocks, less volatile than the broader market, are seen as a shield against possible recessions and belong to sectors less exposed to cutbacks in consumer and business spending, such as groceries, small household products, healthcare insurance, pharmaceuticals, and utilities.The Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation by reducing economic demand have prompted many Wall Street analysts to forecast a recession. Despite this outlook, economic demand has remained relatively stable so far, suggesting that growth could continue to slow with a recession potentially occurring next year.In response to these conditions, Morgan Stanley's team conducted a screening of companies with the 1,000 largest market capitalizations for stocks demonstrating below-average volatility over the past 252 days. These had to be classified as ""growth stocks"" according to the bank's statistical model and hold Overweight ratings from relevant Morgan Stanley analysts. The list includes companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST).UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) was also featured in the selection. Given that health insurance is deemed a necessity even in financially challenging times, it is expected to see annualized sales growth of around 8% over three years beyond 2023, reaching $463 billion in 2026. This projection is based on the company attracting nearly a million new Medicare advantage members annually. UnitedHealth Group's profit margins are also projected to rise slightly over the coming years due to a decrease in its medical-cost ratio after this year’s surge in elective procedures.Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) was another stock identified by Morgan Stanley’s screen. Despite consumers becoming more budget-conscious, sales are expected to grow annually at just over 4% to reach $21.9 billion in 2026 due to consumers' continued need for personal hygiene products. The company anticipates revenue growth from higher sales volumes, despite minor price increases in the near term, and expects costs to moderate in the future.Story continuesWhile these stocks are defensive in nature, they still offer significant upside potential. For instance, UnitedHealth Group's shares are trading at around 18.7 times earnings-per-share estimates for the next year, slightly above the S&amp;P 500’s 18 times. Meanwhile, Colgate-Palmolive's stock trades at a somewhat pricey 21 times forward earnings, but it could maintain this valuation if a recession occurs and investors turn to consumer-staples stocks.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.49%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

The CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Value Index is a float-adjusted, market-capitalization-weighted index designed to measure equity market performance of mega-capitalization value stocks in the United States.The ETF has gained about 3.90% so far this year and is up about 11.65% in the last one year (as of 09/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $89.91 and $107.46.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 14.94% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

595,12663987-6910-355b-87f8-099cfd31cd5a,UNH,2023-09-20,10 Best Investments During A Recession,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-investments-during-recession-082559142.html,1695111959,STORY,"['UNH', 'ORLY', 'NEE', 'WMT', 'JNJ', 'PCG', 'STZ', 'PM']","[insIn this article, we discuss 10 best investments during a recession. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is involved in supplying and transporting electricity and natural gas to customers in the northern and central regions of California, USA. On August 7, UBS analyst Gregg Orrill raised PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target, up from $19, noting that lower wildfire threats and constructive California regulations lend the company an optimistic outlook. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is one of the best recession stocks to buy.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 51 hedge funds were bullish on PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), one down from the previous quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the top stakeholder of the firm with 54 million shares worth over $933 million.Third Point Management made the following comment about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our strategy is to preserve liquidity and buying power to take advantage of markets when they “break”. While overall indices remain elevated, we are finding more chances to provide liquidity across all three asset classes in which we invest – credit, structured credit, and equity – opportunities which have been key drivers of performance for the fund. Our portfolio is balanced across industries with a focus on event-driven names including companies involved in spin-offs, significant cost-cutting, or other types of under-appreciated business transformation. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), which is still our largest position, continues to deliver strong performance, down 50bps in the first quarter but up 6.2% for the year to date after the Fire Victims Trust sold another 60 million shares in a block trade.”8.

The revenue of $4.07 billion increased 10.9% year-over-year, also topping market consensus by $60 million. During recessionary periods, the auto repair market becomes quite costly, causing most people to do minor fixes themselves. This usually leads to an increase in sales for automotive parts and tools, making O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) one of the best recession stocks to invest in.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), same as the previous quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the top stakeholder of the firm with 1.11 million shares worth approximately $1.06 billion.The London Company Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) – ORLY outperformed during Q2 led by share gains in its Pro business. Despite macro uncertainties, demand remains strong as customers are prioritizing the repair and maintenance of vehicles. ORLY remains the gold standard for service, part availability, and logistics in this industry. ORLY has a strong balance sheet, and has a good record of effective share repurchase.Reduced: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) – Reduced ORLY twice during Q2, reflecting strong recent performance that resulted in a relatively high valuation.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What Is Estée Lauder Companies's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Estée Lauder Companies had debt of US$8.22b, up from US$5.50b in one year. However, it also had US$4.03b in cash, and so its net debt is US$4.19b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Estée Lauder Companies' LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Estée Lauder Companies had liabilities of US$6.24b due within a year, and liabilities of US$10.8b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$4.03b and US$1.45b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$11.5b.Story continuesWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Estée Lauder Companies has a huge market capitalization of US$54.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Estée Lauder Companies's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.7), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 14.3 times, makes us even more comfortable. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Estée Lauder Companies if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 49% cut to EBIT over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Estée Lauder Companies's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. In the last three years, Estée Lauder Companies's free cash flow amounted to 42% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Our ViewNeither Estée Lauder Companies's ability to grow its EBIT nor its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow gave us confidence in its ability to take on more debt. But its interest cover tells a very different story, and suggests some resilience. We think that Estée Lauder Companies's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since leverage can boost returns on equity, but it is something to be aware of. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies  you should be aware of, and 2 of them can't be ignored.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

EL is in a tight spot because of persistent inflationary pressures. The leading skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care product provider is grappling with unfavorable currency headwinds.On its last earnings call, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company stated that it is cautious about economic hurdles in China, volatile inflation levels, foreign currency fluctuations and concerns surrounding recession (in several global markets). For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, management anticipates reported and organic net sales to decline 12-10% year over year. The bottom line is envisioned in the band of a loss of 31 cents per share and a loss of 21 cents in the fiscal first quarter.The Estee Lauder Companies’ stock has slumped 34.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 22.7% decline. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples’s decline of 3% during this time.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Hurting EL’s Performance?In fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, The Estee Lauder Companies’ adjusted gross profit came in at $2,467 million, down 3% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 67.8% from 71% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by the under-absorption of overhead in its plants stemming from the pull-down of production during the year. The company’s operating income fell 66% to $71 million while its operating margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) to 2%. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 70 bps, thanks to increased advertising and promotional activities.Owing to The Estee Lauder Companies’ solid international presence, it remains exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Any adverse currency fluctuation will likely weigh on the company’s operating performance. For fiscal 2024, management projects an unfavorable currency impact of 1% on net sales. Currency headwinds will likely affect net earnings per share (EPS) by nearly 11 cents in fiscal 2024.In its last earnings call, management highlighted that macroeconomic headwinds across China have slowed down the Asia travel retail business. Consequently, inventory levels in the trade and Asia travel retail have improved slowly. This will likely put increased pressure on the company’s first-half fiscal 2024 performance.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsThe Estee Lauder Companies is expanding its omnichannel capabilities to aid consumers with flexible and convenient shopping options. Management is on track with four strategic imperatives, including fueling momentum where its business is driving and reaccelerating growth in the United States, among others. The company has a strong presence in emerging markets, which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets.Whether these upsides can help The Estee Lauder Companies counter the downsides above is yet to be seen.3 Solid Cosmetic StocksInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

WPP, the world's top advertising group, in August downgraded its full-year growth forecast due to lower spending by technology companies.""The result (of the contract) will be better decision-making and media planning to allow campaigns to build brands and win consumer attention at scale,"" a Nestle spokesperson said in a statement.Nestle declined to comment on how much it spends on advertising and marketing in Europe, or on details of the deal, such as its length. The Swiss company previously employed a number of media agencies across Europe.WPP OpenMind will coordinate Nestle's marketing communications - including buying advertising space and planning campaigns - for its hundreds of brands in Europe including Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee.The agency will not, however, be in charge of creative work such as animation, making jingles and other content generation.Nestle said Tuesday's announcement was for Europe only, and had no bearing on other regions.Like many of its rivals, Nestle's spending on marketing was muted last year largely because of supply chain problems and uncertainty over consumer behaviour, but has returned this year.Top brands are battling to hold onto customers as some cut spending or switch to cheaper alternatives amid rising prices.CEO Mark Schneider said in July that Nestle's second-quarter marketing spend was ""significantly above last year's level"" and it would ""continue to invest in a very robust manner in the second half of 2023"".In the first half of 2023, Nestle's advertising and marketing spend increased by 7.5% in constant currency versus the same period of the prior year.

Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Strong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Story continuesCurrent Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors’ sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don’t cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the economic landscape of Costa Rica and its allure for U.S Expatriates, go to the 5 Best Places to Retire in Costa Rica.Economic Landscape of Costa RicaCosta Rica is a beautiful country in Central America, with coastlines on the Caribbean and Pacific. It is exemplified by lush rainforests, diverse wildlife, and picturesque beaches, making it a stunning natural paradise. The upper-middle-income country has demonstrated steady economic growth over the past 25 years. However, in 2020, Costa Rica experienced its most significant decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), contracting by 4.1% primarily as a result of the pandemic. This decline resulted from less foreign demand for goods and services, a drop in tourism, and logistical delays.In 2021, the country experienced a robust economic rebound, with GDP surging by 7.8%. As of 2023, growth is anticipated to moderate to 2.7%. Owing to its well-educated labor force, living conditions, low levels of corruption, physical location, attractive trade-free zone initiatives, and dynamic investment promotion board, the country holds a strong appeal to investors. The Costa Rican Central Bank reported the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to be an estimated $1.7 billion in 2020.Moreover, FDI Intelligence reports that Costa Rica, North Macedonia, and the UAE were the world's best foreign direct investment (FDI) performers relative to the size of their economies in 2022. Foreign direct investment inflow in 2022 as estimated by the Costa Rican Central Bank was $3.045 billion, or 4.45% of GDP. The last two decades have also been remarkably successful in establishing and promoting a well-founded business ecosystem.However, the U.S. Department of State notes that some factors threaten the Costa Rican business climate, namely, high energy costs, deteriorating infrastructure, and underperformance of crucial government service provisions such as healthcare. Its political and economic leadership needs help exercising budget discipline while simultaneously responding to demands for improved government-provided infrastructure and services.Story continuesNevertheless, the country has taken great leaps to diversify and improve its economy. It is home to more than 300 high-tech companies and 29 of the Fortune 100 companies. These companies include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), amongst others. Many of these companies have been investing in the country as well, such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). According to NASDAQ, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) aims to invest $1.2 billion in Costa Rica over the next two years.Costa Rica's Allure for U.S. ExpatriatesOwing to the promising business and economic landscape, natural beauty, and low cost of living, Costa Rica has been witnessing a significant influx of immigrants from around the world. It is also one of the easiest countries to retire to, which is why many expats choose to move here. According to the Costa Rica Immigration Experts, as many as 120,000 U.S. expatriates live in Costa Rica, many of them as retirees. A lot of these retirees choose to live in the Central Valley in the country, often regarded as one of the best places to retire in Costa Rica from the USA. Retirees are also flocking to Costa Rica because of its pleasant climate, lush rainforests, and serene coastlines. For this reason, we have established an entire list of the best places to retire in Costa Rica for retirees. The country is a popular choice for many who want to move from their countries in hopes of stretching their retirement incomes further. Retiring to Costa Rica has many pros and cons, too. For starters, Costa Rica boasts the highest standard of living compared to other Central American countries.There are top-notch amenities available, such as healthcare, communications, dining, galleries, and theaters. Moreover, the people in Costa Rica have access to both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. The Central Valley, for instance, boasts year-round spring-like temperatures that average around 74ºF (23ºC). There is also a sizable expat community, so retirees will find it easier to socialize and integrate into the community.However, retirees may also need some help retiring in Costa Rica. For instance, some areas face frequent power outages and slow internet connections. Road conditions are poor in some parts of the country, and there is potentially heavy traffic in a big city like San Jose. Moreover, the pace of life is relatively slow here. This might be fine for retirees who wish to make the move for some peace and quiet.Investing in Costa Rica from AbroadSince Costa Rica boasts a positive business and economic climate on the whole, many investors may like to invest in it, either from within the country or from outside the U.S. Investing in Costa Rica from abroad is very much possible, and there is more than one way to do so. One popular choice for retirees and snowbirds is buying residential real estate, as the country offers a vast choice of vacation and retirement homes.The country also has an extremely low property tax rate of 0.25% of the registered property's value, making it an excellent incentive for retirees who want their dollars to stretch further. Home buyers can choose from mountainsides, lakefronts, and even beaches to purchase real estate in the country.Real Estate Investment Funds (REITs) are one way of investing in Costa Rica without having to buy a property. The only US-accredited fund that operates here is the Costa Rica REIT. Costa Rica REIT focuses on vacation rental investments and offers clients the opportunity to invest in Costa Rica properties at a discount. Individuals can also choose to start a business in the country, owing to the country’s geographic “free zones” with special tax breaks and similar incentives that aim to invite job-creating businesses.Lastly, individuals can also choose to invest in Costa Rican stocks. Known as the Bolsa Nacional de Valores, Costa Rica's stock exchange is extremely small and has about 60 companies listing stocks. The stock market has little liquidity compared to other markets, so it isn't as lucrative. Other countries offer easier access to foreign stock investors through an American deposit receipt (ADR) or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Unfortunately, Costa Rica does not have an ADR or ETF.12 Best Places to Retire in Costa RicaMalgorzata Drewniak/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo compile the list of best places to retire in Costa Rica, we have used a total of 10 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) sources.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income and its benefits in today's world, and go directly to read 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. The concept of passive income is becoming increasingly popular as more people are leaning towards side jobs. A survey by Zapier from May 2022 found that 36% of Gen Xers have a side job, while 59% of Gen Zers and 61% of millennials have one. Gen Zers, in particular, make around $9,537 annually from their side gigs. These side hustles can be a very good way to supplement income, though they are not typically considered passive income sources. However, some side hustles may become more passive over time as people streamline operations, delegate tasks, or automate processes. Earlier this year, CNBC did a report on Jasmine McCall, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who makes $105,000 a month in passive income from her side hustle.Passive income typically comes from investments, assets, or activities that require minimal ongoing effort once set up. Last year’s inflation increased the appeal of passive investing in stocks, particularly dividend-paying stocks. Passive equity funds, which are primarily designed for long-term capital appreciation and wealth accumulation, are about to achieve a significant milestone. Their total assets worldwide are soon going to surpass the assets of actively managed funds, a trend that has been developing for over a decade, as reported by Societe Generale. According to James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, passive investing has been growing consistently in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds or passive ETFs own about 19% of the shares of the typical publicly traded U.S. stock. This ownership has tripled since 2013.AI and Passive IncomeIn a recent survey conducted by GOBankingRates, people were asked about their thoughts on using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate passive income. The results were positive, with 45% of respondents expressing their interest in using AI for passive income, and an extra 8% mentioned they had already done so.Story continuesAI-focused companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can potentially help people earn passive income. The company with its expansive digital ecosystem, offers opportunities for passive income through advertising revenue for content creators on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) utilizes AI in various aspects of its business, including its e-commerce and cloud services. Earning passive income through the company can be achieved through various avenues, primarily by participating in its affiliate program, publishing ebooks on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), or utilizing Amazon's print-on-demand services.All these strategies mentioned above can help generate passive income, but investing in dividend-paying stocks is also a dependable way to make money passively. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some well-known companies that have raised their dividends for decades, providing a regular stream of income to investors.Earning passive income can be a good idea when it aligns with one’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and available resources. Diversifying income sources and planning for the long term can enhance financial well-being. In this article, we will discuss 25 best passive income ideas to build wealth in 2023.Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured through several credible and expert sources, including Forbes, Reddit, CNBC, Barron's, and Business Insider, renowned for their insights and expertise in the field of finance and passive income. By aggregating information from these reputable outlets, we aimed to identify common threads and consensus recommendations regarding strategies for generating passive income. Our goal was to offer a curated selection of passive income ideas that have garnered recognition and success among individuals pursuing passive income.25. Music and Photo LicensingA music license is permission granted to use copyrighted music. It's commonly used in movies, TV shows, commercials, online videos, and any visual content that wants to use a song legally.

(NYSE:SSTK), Adobe Stock, or music libraries. Shutterstock remained popular among elite funds in Insider Monkey’s database, as 31 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of Q2 2023, up from 25 in the previous quarter.24. Rent out Your Spare RoomEarning passive income by renting out a spare room in your home can be a lucrative way to make extra money. However, it is always advised to check local laws and regulations regarding room rentals. Some areas may have specific rules, permits, or taxes related to short-term rentals. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is one of the most well-known platforms for renting out spare rooms and entire homes to travelers.

Distribution platforms like Audible allow the publishing of these audiobooks and make them available for sale on major audiobooks retailers such as iTunes and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).22. Buy and Sell WebsitesBuying and selling websites for passive income can be a profitable online business model. It involves acquiring existing websites, improving them, and then selling them for a profit. It is also important to continuously monitor the website's performance, make necessary adjustments, and track key metrics like traffic, revenue, and profitability.21. Develop a Niche Job BoardDeveloping a niche job board refers to creating an online platform or website that specializes in listing job opportunities within a specific industry, profession, or category. Unlike general job search websites like Indeed or LinkedIn, which cover a wide range of job types and industries, a niche job board focuses on a particular niche or sector. After setting up the job board, making money by charging companies for posting job listings is a good way to earn passive income. Indeed, SimplyHired, and CareerBuilder are some of the most prominent websites that operate niche job boards.20. Sell Your NotesSelling notes typically involves creating and selling study or course materials, lecture notes, or educational content to students or learners. Well-researched, organized, and easy-to-understand notes provide real value to the target audience and are and are priced competitively. Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is one of the largest online marketplaces for educational resources. It allows teachers and educators to sell their lesson plans, worksheets, and other educational materials.19. Run an Affiliate Marketing BusinessRunning an affiliate marketing business is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. It involves promoting other companies' products or services and earning commissions for driving sales or leads to those businesses. Consistent, quality content and effective SEO can help maintain a steady flow of commissions, making it a potentially lucrative source of passive income over the long term. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s affiliates program is one of the largest and most popular. Users can promote a wide range of products on the Amazon platform and earn commissions on sales generated through your affiliate links.18. Create a Mobile AppCreating a mobile app can be a potential source of passive income. People should either create the app themselves if they have the skills or hire a developer. It is important to make sure that the app is user-friendly, well-designed, and functions smoothly. The monetization strategy works best when earning passive income.17. Purchase ATMsPurchasing ATMs involves a specific business model and understanding of the ATM industry but it can be a very reliable way to earn passive income. When someone uses the ATM to withdraw cash, they are charged a fee for convenience, a part of which goes to the ATM owner.16. Start an E-Commerce StoreStarting an e-commerce store is one of the most popular passive income ideas today. The pandemic of 2020 has boosted online shopping and income seekers are trying to make the most of this trend. According to a report on digital shopping, more than 265 million consumers in the US are expected to be shopping online in 2023. People can earn passive income by setting up an online retail business that operates with minimal day-to-day involvement once it's established. E-commerce platforms like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) can help build and host an online store. In the second quarter of 2023, Shopify generated nearly $1.7 billion in revenues, which showed a 31% growth from the same period last year.15. Peer-to-Peer Car RentalsPeer-to-peer car rental is a practice where individuals rent their private vehicles to others on a short-term basis, usually through an online platform or app. It is a profitable venture, especially if the vehicles are underutilized. However, it's crucial to provide excellent customer service, maintain your vehicles, and understand the terms and conditions of the platform you choose. Getaround, Inc. (NYSE:GETR) offers peer-to-peer car sharing in various cities in the US. Car owners can list their vehicles for rent, and renters can book them for short-term use. The company was a part of 15 hedge fund portfolios in our database at the end of Q2 2023.14. Invest in Vending MachinesVending machines are popular among people because of their convenience and ability to provide a wide range of products and services to consumers without the need for human intervention. According to a market report, the worldwide retail vending machine market was worth about $51.91 billion in 2021 and is projected to keep growing at an annual rate of about 10.7% from 2022 to 2030. Income seekers can earn passive income through vending machines by purchasing and strategically placing these machines in high-traffic areas. After initial setup, the machines can generate income with minimal ongoing effort. It is one of the best passive income ideas on our list as effective management and product selection are key to maximizing returns.13. Royalties from Intellectual PropertiesThis idea refers to payments or fees earned by the owner or creator of intellectual property (IP) for allowing others to use, license, or distribute their intellectual assets. Income seekers should ensure that their intellectual property is legally protected through copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other applicable forms of intellectual property rights.12. Sell Designs OnlineEarning passive income by selling designs online is a creative venture. Many online marketplaces allow users to develop unique and high-quality designs that cater to a specific niche or market. This can include graphic designs, illustrations, digital art, t-shirt designs, printables, or any other creative works. Some of the most prominent platforms include Etsy, Inc. (NYSE:ETSY) and Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK).11. Investing in BondsEarning passive income by investing in bonds can be a relatively low-risk way to generate regular income. To invest in bonds, income seekers can buy them directly from the issuer or in the secondary market through a brokerage account. The secondary market allows you to buy and sell bonds from other investors. Holding bonds until they mature ensures that investors receive the full face value of the bond, provided the issuer remains solvent. This approach minimizes interest rate risk. Investors will receive regular interest payments until maturity. They can also choose to reinvest the interest income they receive, compounding the returns over time. Alternatively, investors can use the interest payments as a source of passive income.10. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) BusinessSaaS business is a model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access and use SaaS applications through web browsers. Income seekers can earn passively after developing a valuable software product, setting up a subscription-based pricing model, and continuously attracting and retaining customers. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top SaaS companies. The company’s revenue for Q2 2023 came in at $8.6 billion, which showed an 11.4% growth from the same period last year.9. High-Yield Savings AccountsA high-yield savings account is a type of savings account offered by banks and financial institutions that typically provides a higher interest rate compared to traditional savings accounts. The account with competitive interest rates allows the power of compound interest to work for income seekers. With compounding, the interest gets added to the principal balance, allowing the savings to grow over time.8. Start a Blog or YouTube ChannelStarting a blog or YouTube channel is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. Income seekers can create content according to their own interests or expertise and monetize it through methods like display ads, affiliate marketing, and selling digital products or courses. The passive aspect comes into play once the created content gains traction by attracting viewers and readers over time.7. Create a Subscription Box ServiceThis strategy involves curating and delivering a selection of products or experiences to subscribers on a recurring basis, typically monthly. Profit seekers should select a niche or theme that resonates with their target audience and establish relationships with suppliers to create high-quality themed boxes. Effective marketing strategies are key to attracting subscribers, and once a substantial customer base comes into play, the income becomes passive as subscribers renew their subscriptions automatically.6. Automated DropshippingAutomated dropshipping is a business model in e-commerce where an online retailer (the dropshipper) sells products to customers without physically handling the inventory. Instead, the drop shipper partners with a supplier or manufacturer who handles the storage, packaging, and shipping of products directly to the customers. The primary role of income seekers revolves around marketing, customer service, and optimizing their e-commerce store. As the store gains traction, it can generate passive income through product sales and repeat customers. Click to continue reading and see 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best Materials ETFs20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202312 Stocks That Will Double In 2023Disclosure.

(NASDAQ:SRCL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Stericycle Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$265.9mUS$313.5mUS$365.5mUS$413.5mUS$449.0mUS$478.9mUS$504.3mUS$526.3mUS$545.7mUS$563.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 8.59%Est @ 6.66%Est @ 5.30%Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.70%Est @ 3.23% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$247US$271US$294US$309US$313US$310US$304US$295US$284US$273(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.9bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$563m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$5.2bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.1b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$44.7, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Stericycle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.073. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for StericycleStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for SRCL.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Stericycle, there are three relevant factors you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. SL Green (SLG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.34 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.34 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.29 Zacks Consensus Estimate, SL Green has an Earnings ESP of 3.76%.SLG is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Progressive (PGR).Slated to report earnings on October 12, 2023, Progressive holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.74 a share 24 days from its next quarterly update.Progressive's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 7.88% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.Story continuesSLG and PGR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Investors believe that ""cash is king"" in the current environment of persistent inflation, high interest rates, and a potential economic slowdown.A cash cow is a company or a business unit in a mature, slow-growth industry. Cash cows have a large share of the market and require little investment. These companies achieve a commanding position within their industry and generate consistent free cash flow. They are the profit engines of a diversified portfolio, providing the resources required for other business units to grow and invest in new opportunities.While there are several cash cow stocks, we have highlighted five of them having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Amazon.com AMZN, Verizon Communications VZ, McKesson Corporation MCK and D.R. Horton Inc. DHI. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Key Characteristics of Cash Cow CompaniesSteady Revenue Streams: Cash cows thrive in mature markets where demand has stabilized. Their products or services achieve widespread acceptance, resulting in a consistent revenue stream.High Market Share: These companies typically have a dominant share of the market, often due to years of successful operations and brand establishment.Operational Efficiency: Cash cows are known for their streamlined operations, efficient cost management and optimized production processes, which allow them to generate substantial profits with relatively lower expenses.Strong Brand Identity: Building a strong brand identity over the years helps cash cow companies maintain customer loyalty and withstand market fluctuations.Cash Generation: As the name suggests, these companies generate ample cash flow. This surplus cash can be reinvested into the business, used for dividends, or allocated to other ventures within the company's portfolio.Story continuesCurrent Market TrendsAfter a solid first half, Wall Street lost momentum in the second half. Worries over longer-than-expected higher interest rates and a weakening Chinese economy have been weighing on investors’ sentiment.Fed officials have signaled they are prepared to lift borrowing costs again if the economy and inflation don’t cool further. Both retail sales and inflation in the United States came in hotter than expected for August, suggesting resilience in the economy and persistent price pressure, making a case for more Fed rate hikes.The latest data also showed that U.S. industrial production continued to expand in August, beating expectations, even though the pace of increase decelerated due to sluggish manufacturing growth. Last week, the United Auto Workers union officially launched a historic strike at select Big Three automaker plants after the failure of a new contract. This acted as the latest headwind in the stock market.Stocks to Bet OnProcter &amp; Gamble is a branded consumer products company, which markets its products in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies.With a market cap of $361.8 billion, the stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.1% for the fiscal year (ending June 2024).

You should consider the First Trust Large Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF (FTA), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 05/08/2007.The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $1.19 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.59%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.17%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 24.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Pultegroup, Inc. (PHM) accounts for about 1.18% of total assets, followed by D.r. Horton, Inc. (DHI) and Lennar Corporation (LEN).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 10.38% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFTA seeks to match the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Value Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ AlphaDEX Large Cap Value Index is an enhanced index which employs the AlphaDEX stock selection methodology to select stocks from the NASDAQ US 500 Large Cap Value Index.The ETF has added about 3.29% so far this year and it's up approximately 9.20% in the last one year (as of 09/19/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $57.68 and $73.30.The ETF has a beta of 1.13 and standard deviation of 18.32% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 188 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust Large Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FTA is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $50.54 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $101.60 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

616,d9bfc754-7282-3a03-998e-23cba8c9f3c7,AAL,2023-09-20,Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-unfriendliest-cities-us-155954471.html,1695139194,STORY,"['EXPE', 'AAL', 'MAR', 'DAL']","[This article covers the Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US. For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article, Top 5 Unfriendliest Cities in the US.One of the biggest factors behind any city turning unfriendly is tourism gone rouge. It's a negative feedback loop. A city begins to attract tourists in droves. That becomes a problem for the locals. Locals naturally become unfriendly and rude to tourists. Tourists label the locals as unfriendly and rude and the city becomes notorious for its unfriendliness. A study published in the European Journal of Tourism Research found that mass tourism can lead to ""overtourism,"" which can have negative consequences for local residents. Overtourism can put a strain on the local community, as residents may feel irritated by the crowds and the noise. It can also lead to an unnecessary reliance on the tourism industry, which can disrupt local labor structures and community roles.Tourism in the United StatesInternational travel plays a critical role in supporting the economy of the US. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign travelers spent over $233.5 billion in the tourism industry. This injected $640 million into the country every day. In January 2023, travel spending in the US amounted to $14.75 billion, up 64% from January 2022. US travel spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by the end of 2023, up from $1.2 trillion in 2022. By 2026, spending is expected to reach $1.26 trillion. Consequently, the airline industry in the US is currently faring well. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), American airline traffic reached an all-time high in May 2023, with over 81.8 million passengers carried, both domestically and internationally. Major airlines like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) are currently dominant players in the US airline market. It is one of the 20 best airlines in the world, with a fleet of over 900 aircraft.  Hotel accommodation establishments across the country have been busy this summer. Marriott International (NASDAQ: MAR) reported a 10% increase in revenue in the second quarter in the US, driven by higher occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Marriott  (NASDAQ:MAR) plans to open over 35 new luxury hotels in 2023, and expand their portfolio to over 500 properties worldwide.Story continuesCompanies Ensuring Sustainable Tourism in AmericaIn 2023, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), an American travel technology conglomerate, partnered with the UnTours Foundation and TUI Care Foundation to launch a $10 million fund. Through this fund, Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) hopes to help scale sustainable tourism businesses. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), a major US airline, is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. The company has been exploring ways to use more sustainable materials, improve fuel efficiency, and offset its carbon emissions. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has started a trial of reusable cups for in-flight drinks, which will reduce their environmental impact and fulfill their commitment to sustainability.Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the USMethodology We defined the ""unfriendliest cities in the US"" as those where foreign travelers have reported having unpleasant experiences with the locals.To collect information, we conducted a systematic search of relevant Reddit threads, where users recounted their experiences with unfriendly locals in specific cities. The subreddits we included in our search were r/AskAnAmerican, r/AskReddit, r/Damnthatsinteresting, and r/Travel. We used search terms such as ""unfriendliest cities,"" ""unfriendliest citizens,"" ""rudest citizens,"" and ""unhelpful citizens"" to identify relevant threads.To ensure the authenticity and relevance of our research, we identified the unfriendliest cities in the US by analyzing the frequency of mentions of these cities on different Reddit threads and discussions.Below is our complete list of the Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US.  Top 20 Unfriendliest Cities in the US According to Reddit20.

The crew member entered just before the 14-year-old, told her the seat was broken but not to worry about it and then re-entered the bathroom after she left, her family said in a written statement.After using the toilet, the girl realized that a largely obscured iPhone had been affixed to the back of the toilet seat, apparently to record her. She took a picture of this with her own phone before leaving the bathroom.“These events have left our daughter — and entire family — shocked and profoundly disturbed,” the family wrote in a statement.Paul Llewellyn, a lawyer representing the family, said they have not yet filed a lawsuit.Law enforcement officers met the plane at the gate after it landed. Massachusetts State Police escorted a flight attendant off the flight.State police later deferred to the FBI as the primary investigating agency because the episode happened in the air, where the FBI has jurisdiction.An FBI spokesperson declined comment via email.American Airlines said in a statement after the incident that officials at the airline “take this matter very seriously and are fully cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation, as safety and security are our highest priorities.”]"

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and recessionary concerns, head directly to 5 Best Investments During A Recession.The United States economy managed to steer clear of a recession due to a robust job market. However, this is typically one of the final aspects to weaken when interest rates rise. A consistent trend has emerged in such cycles – out of the last nine instances where the Federal Reserve increased rates, seven led to an economic recession. As per Darrell Cronk, who heads the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, the expectation is that a downturn will occur either in the latter half of 2023 or early 2024.It is the second half of the year and the stock market has already started to see the recession effects, in line with what J.P. Morgan Research anticipates – the United States is likely to experience a gentle economic downturn by late 2023. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, leading to more stringent credit conditions, which in turn will gradually exert downward pressure on economic expansion. While many stocks have seen a downward trend, a few industries have benefited from this economic stress, making their specific stocks attractive investment options for global investors. Some of these include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication services, DIY, and related industries. The profits of these stocks are usually protected from fluctuations in economic cycles and changes in consumer confidence.During a recession, utilities often benefit because their services, like electricity, gas, and water, are necessities that people continue to use regardless of economic conditions. Their stable demand and essential nature provide a consistent revenue stream. Healthcare remains essential, and demand for medical services remains relatively stable as well. Moreover, consumer staples like food, beverages, toiletries, and household items are considered necessities, and the segment is less affected by economic downturns, making companies in this sector more resilient. However, there might be a shift toward more cost-conscious purchasing, with consumers opting for store-brand items and value-oriented products. Communication services, including internet, phone, and media services, remain crucial for both individuals and businesses. Demand for these services can stay strong during a recession, especially as remote work and digital communication become more prevalent. Furthermore, during tough economic times, people might cut back on larger expenses like home renovations, leading to a boost in the do-it-yourself (DIY) industry.  Story continuesReuters mentioned the July 2022 analysis of Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America:“A number of forces have coincided to slow economic momentum more rapidly than we previously expected. We now forecast a mild recession in the U.S. economy this year - In addition to fading of prior fiscal support, inflation shocks have eaten into real spending power of households more forcefully than we forecasted previously and financial conditions have tightened noticeably as the Fed shifted its tone toward more rapid increases in its policy rate.”The current market performance can be a motivator for investors to consider the best investments during a recession. Ergo, investors looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in these stocks can check our list, which includes companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Our MethodologyWe selected the best stocks to invest in during a recession based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. These stocks belong to sectors like consumer staples, utilities, healthcare, and auto repairs/home remodeling, as these sectors have historically thrived or remained steady during economic downturns. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During A RecessionImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayBest Investments During A Recession10. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) manufactures, imports, promotes, and distributes beer, wine, and spirits in countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy. On June 30, Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, in line with the previous quarter. The dividend was distributed on August 24, to shareholders of record on August 10. Based on historic trends, the consumption of alcoholic beverages increases substantially during economic recessions, making Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) a top investment option at this time.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 48 hedge funds were bullish on Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), compared to 41 in the last quarter. Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the firm, with 796,935 shares valued at an estimated $196 million. Like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the best recession stocks to watch. Blue Hawk Investment Group made the following comment about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Constellation Brands (STZ) – STZ bounced back significantly from a rough Q1 and is now up 73% from its low point in March – though still down 5% year-to-date. As we noted in last quarter’s letter, we could not find any fundamental reasons to meaningfully change our estimate of long-term value, and our decision to add to our position as it fell has so far turned out to be a good one. We believe that the market mispriced risks around the company’s exposure to restaurant and bar sales, as well as the impact of a temporary shutdown to beer production in Mexico. STZ over indexes to “off-premise” (non-bar/restaurant) sales relative to the rest of the industry, so a 75% reduction in bar/restaurant sales during the most recent quarter was nearly offset by just a 20% increase in off-premise. Modelo and Corona products continued to sell very well (aided by the recent launch of Corona Hard Seltzer), helping STZ to deliver better-than-expected results for the March-May fiscal quarter. Beer production also returned to normal levels in June before STZ suffered any notable out-of-stocks in popular products. The market has started to come back around to our view that Constellation Brands is positioned very well over the near, intermediate, and longer terms. We harvested some gains as the stock price came roaring back, but valuation remains below historical averages, and it is still a top-five holding in our portfolio (with good diversifying characteristics relative to the rest of our top positions).”9. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is involved in supplying and transporting electricity and natural gas to customers in the northern and central regions of California, USA. On August 7, UBS analyst Gregg Orrill raised PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stock to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target, up from $19, noting that lower wildfire threats and constructive California regulations lend the company an optimistic outlook. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is one of the best recession stocks to buy.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 51 hedge funds were bullish on PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), one down from the previous quarter. Dan Loeb’s Third Point is the top stakeholder of the firm with 54 million shares worth over $933 million.Third Point Management made the following comment about PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Our strategy is to preserve liquidity and buying power to take advantage of markets when they “break”. While overall indices remain elevated, we are finding more chances to provide liquidity across all three asset classes in which we invest – credit, structured credit, and equity – opportunities which have been key drivers of performance for the fund. Our portfolio is balanced across industries with a focus on event-driven names including companies involved in spin-offs, significant cost-cutting, or other types of under-appreciated business transformation. PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), which is still our largest position, continues to deliver strong performance, down 50bps in the first quarter but up 6.2% for the year to date after the Fire Victims Trust sold another 60 million shares in a block trade.”8.

(NASDAQ:ORLY), same as the previous quarter.

Despite macro uncertainties, demand remains strong as customers are prioritizing the repair and maintenance of vehicles. ORLY remains the gold standard for service, part availability, and logistics in this industry. ORLY has a strong balance sheet, and has a good record of effective share repurchase.Reduced: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) – Reduced ORLY twice during Q2, reflecting strong recent performance that resulted in a relatively high valuation. ORLY remains well positioned for growth and leads the auto parts industry, which is fairly insulated from economic turbulence.”7. Philip Morris International Inc.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead. Furthermore, at current trading levels, we think the company’s operating leverage, pricing power, and free cash flow profile offer a margin of safety.”6. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power, from sources like wind, solar, nuclear, coal, and natural gas, to both individual consumers and businesses in North America.

The downgrade comes in light of the company's sales underperformance compared to industry rivals AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) Automotive over the past 18 months. The company's strategy of maintaining high prices has been identified as a contributing factor to its loss of market share.This year, the stock value of Advance Auto Parts has seen a sharp decline, dropping by over 60%. This has triggered discussions among investors about the potential opportunity to purchase the depreciated stock or whether it should be avoided due to the company's ongoing struggles.S&amp;P Global's critique of Advance Auto Parts' strategy is rooted in the company's approach to preserving high profit margins by maintaining stable prices. The rating agency argues that this strategy has eroded the company's competitive standing in an industry where reasonably priced, readily available in-store parts are highly demanded by the professional market.The company's revenue growth and operating margin progression have lagged behind its competitors due to this strategy. The newly appointed CEO, Shane O'Kelly, is expected to address these issues. O'Kelly replaces former CEO Tom Greco, who served from 2016-2023 and will remain as an advisor. Despite significant efforts and the involvement of activist investor Starboard Value during Greco's tenure, Advance Auto Parts failed to close the operational performance gap with AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive.O'Kelly will contribute to an operational and strategic review of the business, following the company's acknowledgment of its need for improved performance. Despite years of underperformance against its peers, management maintains a moderate outlook, citing recent investments made to enhance inventory availability and pricing as factors that have led to sales improvement during the last four weeks of the previous quarter and into the current one.Story continuesGene Lee, Interim Executive Chair of the Board of Directors, stated that the new strategy has been in place for less than a year and expects to see incremental improvements soon. However, doubts persist about whether a strategy implemented within a year can reverse years of underperformance. Advance Auto Parts continues to trail behind its peers in areas such as profit margins, inventory management, and cash conversion.While management believes they are on the right track, the results of the strategic review are yet to be seen. Potential investors may want to wait until these results are revealed before deciding on any investment action, as it remains uncertain whether Advance Auto Parts is on its way to generating value for its shareholders.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Originally published on Principal.comThe positive impacts of arts education for students of all ages have long been acknowledged-improved engagement, setting goals for higher education, and cognitive empathy, to name a few.1However, access to arts education is often limited: The students who could benefit the most from it are often the least likely to receive it.2""Studies have shown that art is a way to enhance the educational experience-to engage students, encourage them to persist, and help set them upon the path to financial security that they wish to walk,"" says Jo Christine Miles, director of Principal Foundation&amp;reg;. ""Art is also known to create community, which is something all students need to foster growth and help them become productive community members.""To expand those pathways, Principal Foundation has funded a collaboration between the Des Moines Art Center and the Des Moines, Iowa-based By Degrees Foundation. Called My Voice, the partnership took place during the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school years.Supporting students through arts educationThe By Degrees Foundation, which works with public schools on the city's north side, selected 12 elementary, middle, and high school students each year to participate in the My Voice cohort. Arts educators from the Art Center developed a curriculum on how to view, discuss, and critique art, intended to help develop critical thinking and vocabulary skills. ""Art can inspire us,"" says Mia Buch, Des Moines Art Center museum educator. ""This program really allowed the curiosity of these students to shine in the things they care about.""The students made multiple visits to the Art Center for tours with an arts educator. As a capstone project, each student selected a work from the museum's permanent collection and responded with original artwork of their own. ""Throughout this process I learned many new skills and information about my background,"" says Karla, an eighth-grade student who participated in My Voice. The piece she created ""influences my future artworks by telling a story, not just a big idea, but what's behind it.""Story continuesBuilding community through artStatistics demonstrate the value of arts education to students-and those benefits extend far beyond schoolhouse walls. Support for the arts unifies communities, boosts local economies and businesses, and sparks innovation.3""Art is a universal language,"" Miles says. ""Pick a country, pick a time period, pick a piece of art, and you will see something, learn something, and understand something.""Principal Foundation funding for My Voice extended to include the publication of four Art Center video ""toolboxes"" for educators, parents, and students. The topics include what to expect when visiting a museum, how to prepare for a museum visit with small children, and how to invite curiosity into the museum experience.The efforts fit neatly into the wide-ranging support that Principal Foundation provides across the globe for basic needs, financial literacy and health, and the arts. ""Art brings people together physically-at galleries, museums, performance spaces-and culturally, through its capacity to tell a community's shared story, to inspire reflection, and form connections that transcend differences,"" Miles says.For students, the impact extended beyond the classroom. ""I loved My Voice,"" says Eh, a ninth grade student. ""It made me proud of my work, my family loved my piece, and [it] made me happy. I also loved seeing artists from different backgrounds come together because of art.""Learn more about Principal Foundation grants and priorities.1Journal of Policy Analysis and Management2The Arts and Public Education, American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences3Americans for the ArtsPrincipal Financial Group Foundation, Inc.

GGG is gaining from strength in the Industrial and Process segments, and investments in product innovation, despite increasing costs and forex woes. The company is also facing weakness in the Contractor segment due to lower demand in the home center channel, slowing construction markets in China and softer demand in the North America pro paint channel.Key Factors Driving GGGBusiness Strength: Graco’s Industrial segment is benefiting from robust activity in the alternative energy, electronics and battery end markets. Increasing orders in the liquid finishing and sealant and adhesive businesses also bode well. GGG expects the segment to benefit from increasing backlogs in powder equipment and systems in the second half of 2023. The Process segment is gaining from continued sales growth in vehicle service, automatic lubrication and semiconductor.Strong price realization, along with favorable product and channel mix, are aiding Graco’s margin performance. The company’s gross margin increased 300 basis points in the first six months of 2023.Investments in Product Innovation: Investments in capacity expansion and product innovation should drive Graco’s growth. In 2023, the company anticipates capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million, including $130 million for facility expansion projects at its Minnesota, South Dakota, Switzerland and Romania facilities. As for innovation, the company introduced hot melt adhesive dispense system, the InvisiPac HM10 and electric-powered airless gun and Ultra QuickShotearlier in 2023.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first six months of 2023, Graco paid out dividends worth $79 million to its shareholders, up 10.7% year over year. It repurchased common stocks worth $7.8 million in the same period. In December 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 11.9% to 23.5 cents per share.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain GGG stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesGraco Inc.

However, the manufacturing sector is still trying to put up a strong fight during these trying times. This has seen production making steady growth for the second consecutive month in August.The sector is poised to make a turnaround as hopes of the Fed finally ending its monetary tightening campaign are high ahead of the Fed’s September FOMC. Given this scenario, industrial stocks like Hubbell Incorporated HUBB, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. AIT, Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Graham Corporation GHM and Flowserve Corporation FLS are expected to benefit in the near term.Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization Inches UpProduction at U.S. factories increased 0.4% in August after increasing 1% in July. Manufacturing output increased 0.1% during the same period. Manufacturing output somewhat slowed in August as it was held back by a 5% decline in output for motor vehicles and parts. Otherwise, factory output rose 0.6%.Capacity utilization increased to 79.7% in August, which came in line with its long-run average from 1972 to 2022.The manufacturing sector continues to face challenges, contracting for the 10th consecutive month in August. The Institute for Supply Management's  manufacturing purchasing managers index  saw a slight increase to 47.6 in August. However, any reading below 50 signifies a contraction in the sector.Production at U.S. factories has been hindered by rising costs of raw materials and increased borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve has responded to these challenges by raising its benchmark interest rate by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.However, inflation has seen a significant decline over the past year from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, while the producer price index  rose 0.7%.Story continuesHowever, a cooling job market and inflation make investors optimistic that the Federal Reserve might consider ending its current monetary tightening policy soon, with hopes that it might leave its interest rate unaltered in its September meeting.Lower interest rates bode well for the manufacturing sector as it will help boost production at U.S. factories.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in the five stocks we have picked below.

ITW is benefiting from stable underlying demand and improving supply chains despite weakness in the semiconductor-related business and forex woes.What’s Aiding ITW?Business Strength: Illinois Tool’s Automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) segment is gaining from strength across all regions and strong organic growth. The Food Equipment unit is being aided by growth across both North America and International operations and strength across institutional end markets. Strength in the capital equipment business bodes well for the Test &amp; Measurement and Electronics segment. Solid industrial and consumables businesses is aiding the Welding segment.Shareholder-Friendly Policies: ITW’s shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. In August 2023, the company hiked its dividend by 7% to $1.40 per share. Simultaneously, the company’s board approved a new $5 billion buyback program. In the first half of 2023, the company bought back shares worth $750 million. In 2023, Illinois Tool expects to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.Bullish 2023 Outlook: Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, Illinois Tool’s bullish guidance for 2023 sparks optimism. The company expects organic growth of 3-5% for the current year. For 2023, ITW expects revenues to increase 2-4% year over year. In the second quarter of 2023, the company raised its earnings guidance to $9.55-$9.95 per share compared with $9.45-$9.85 per share anticipated earlier. Illinois Tool anticipates an operating margin of 24.5-25.5%, with approximately 100-basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain ITW stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

UHS, Tenet Healthcare Corporation THC, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. ACHC and Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH are expected to benefit from these developments.Industry Overview The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services. Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.4 Key Trends Defining the Hospital Industry's FutureCost Optimization: The rising patient volumes, prices of hospital supplies and inflationary pressures are likely to increase hospitals’ operating costs. The improvement in labor and staffing challenges will continue to provide them some breathing room. These companies are expected to increase labor productivity and implement new technologies to optimize expenses. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Story continuesTechnological Advancements: The hospital players are embracing the digital age as technological innovations and wider adoption continue to support growth. This will optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs, increase convenience and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to continue on their growth path. The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis, which will limit patients' waiting time and decrease their treatment costs.Patient Volume Growth: Seniors are now undergoing deferred elective procedures as pandemic-related constraints are fast vanishing. Hence, pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is driving patient volumes. Although inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and similar safety nets can help them navigate through tough times.Rising Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare are expected to stimulate constant growth in the senior population. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population. According to Statista, the leading market and consumer data provider, the percentage of this segment is likely to reach 22% by 2050 from 16.9% witnessed in 2020. The change in demographics and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, more people signing up for healthcare plans through the ACA indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy OutlookThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

(NYSE:UHS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-universal-110404299.html,1695121444,STORY,['UHS'],"[Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$158 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$126. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Universal Health Services' current trading price of US$127 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Universal Health Services’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services What Is Universal Health Services Worth?Good news, investors! Universal Health Services is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Universal Health Services’s ratio of 12.79x is below its peer average of 21.54x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. What’s more interesting is that, Universal Health Services’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Universal Health Services?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 26% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Universal Health Services. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UHS is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UHS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UHS.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexFXH is managed by First Trust Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $1.38 billion, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Health Care ETFs. Before fees and expenses, FXH seeks to match the performance of the StrataQuant Health Care Index.The StrataQuant Health Care Index employs the AlphaDEX stock selection methodology to select stocks from the Russell 1000 Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.61% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.30%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.FXH's heaviest allocation is in the Healthcare sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.When you look at individual holdings, Exact Sciences Corporation (EXAS) accounts for about 2.91% of the fund's total assets, followed by Penumbra, Inc. (PEN) and Universal Health Services, Inc. (class B) (UHS).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 23.49% of FXH's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -7.58% and is down about -2.55% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/19/2023), respectively. FXH has traded between $96.46 and $114.21 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.79 and standard deviation of 17.34% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 84 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust Health Care AlphaDEX ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) tracks Health Care Select Sector Index. Vanguard Health Care ETF has $16.75 billion in assets, Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF has $39.32 billion. VHT has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLV charges 0.10%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan What Is Freeport-McMoRan's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Freeport-McMoRan had debt of US$9.50b at the end of June 2023, a reduction from US$11.1b over a year. However, it does have US$6.68b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$2.81b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Freeport-McMoRan's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Freeport-McMoRan had liabilities of US$4.79b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$20.1b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$6.68b as well as receivables valued at US$1.09b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$17.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Freeport-McMoRan has a huge market capitalization of US$57.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Freeport-McMoRan has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.36. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 12.1 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. It is just as well that Freeport-McMoRan's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 40% over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Freeport-McMoRan's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. In the last three years, Freeport-McMoRan's free cash flow amounted to 46% of its EBIT, less than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness.Our ViewWe feel some trepidation about Freeport-McMoRan's difficulty EBIT growth rate, but we've got positives to focus on, too. To wit both its interest cover and net debt to EBITDA were encouraging signs. We think that Freeport-McMoRan's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since leverage can boost returns on equity, but it is something to be aware of. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Freeport-McMoRan .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our discussion on the materials sector, you can go to the 5 Best Materials ETFs.The global economy heavily relies on basic materials like chemicals, concrete, and metals. Base industrial metals like aluminum, copper, and iron ore are integral for appliances, buildings, equipment, and other infrastructure projects. In addition to these traditional materials, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of metals like lithium in the context of reducing carbon emissions and moving toward renewable energy sources. For instance, the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the demand for specific metals. An average electric car uses 53.2 kilograms of copper as opposed to 22.3 kilograms used in a conventional car. Furthermore, an electric car uses 39.9 kilograms of nickel, 8.9 kilograms of lithium, and 13.3 kilograms of cobalt, all of which are not used in a conventional car.As the transition towards renewable energy is gaining pace with every passing day, leading management consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company believes that materials companies will be required to increase the pace of mining from historical levels for several materials. This could only be ensured by increasing investments in mining, refining, and smelting to roughly $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of this decade. This would reflect a 50% increase from the previous decade. Furthermore, there will be an additional demand of 300,000 to 600,000 mining professionals to support these expanded operations. China is also working aggressively to increase the total output of its material sectors. The country is aiming to achieve a total output of $1.38 trillion (10 trillion yuan) by 2025 from $962.3 billion (7 trillion yuan) in 2021.Investment Options in the Materials SectorWhile basic materials have various industrial uses, they also serve as significant investments due to their qualities as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Inflation in the US is again on the upward trend as the US consumer prices grew by 3.7% YoY in August 2023. This marks the second consecutive month of growth in the consumer price index (CPI) following 12 consecutive months of decline. It must be noted that annual inflation in the US averaged 2.1% between 2000 and 2020. Under these circumstances, investors are looking at basic materials and commodities as a strong hedge against increasing price levels. Throughout history, basic materials, including agricultural goods, commodities, and metals, have shown an upward price trend during periods of high inflation.Story continuesInvestors can consider investing in the best basic materials stocks such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) or the best materials ETFs to gain exposure to the sector. According to our research, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLB) is the oldest ETF in the materials sector. It was launched in December 1998 and is one of 11 Select Sector SPDR ETFs that divide up the S&amp;P 500 by sector. XLB ETF tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. In addition, there are three other ETFs worth mentioning for their notable presence in the materials sector despite not making it onto our list based on their five-year price performance.The first ETF is the Fidelity MSCI Materials Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FMAT), which was launched in October 2013. Over the last five years, the ETF has generated a return of 32.8%. It has a negligible expense ratio of 0.08% only. The second ETF is the Vanguard Materials Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VAW). The materials ETF by Vanguard tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Materials 25/50 Index. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, which is typical for Vanguard Index funds. Over the past five years, the fund has generated a return of 32.7%. The third ETF that requires special mention is the iShares Global Materials ETF (NYSEARCA:MXI), which tracks the S&amp;P Global 1200 Materials Index. The ETF has experienced an increase of 21.6% in the last five years.10 Best Materials ETFsOur MethodologyWe have shortlisted the 10 best materials ETFs for 2023 based on their 5-year performance. Some of the ETFs included in the list provide broad exposure across the sector, while some are focused on a sub-industry within the materials sector. It's important to note that the number of holdings mentioned for these ETFs does not include cash as a holding. The top five ETFs on our list have even outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index based on their five-year performance. The ETFs have been ranked in ascending order of their performance as of September 15.Best Materials ETFs10.

(NASDAQ:RGLD) with 11%, 10.7%, and 10.4% weight, respectively.Here's what White Falcon Capital Management said about Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Precious Metals Royalty basket (Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), SSL, TFPM): In the current macroeconomic environment, there are many ways to ‘win’ with gold. It is remarkable that even with record positive real yields, gold is flirting with all time highs. Why? Western central banks are increasing interest rates which means that they will have to pay more interest on the record levels of debt that their government’s owe. Where will the money come from to pay the higher interest expense? The answer is simple – more debt and more money printing! We believe the gold knows this! We believe that precious metals will protect real purchasing power and act as a hedge to the portfolio when macroeconomic uncertainty arises. Owning royalty companies at reasonable valuations gives us a high quality exposure to precious metals without project or cost inflation risks inherent in a mining company.”9.

(NYSE:CEIX) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We have a large investment across the energy &amp; commodity spaces. The thesis is simple…we haven’t developed enough energy or commodity resources to satisfy the near- and medium term needs of the world as well as provide for a renewable/less-carbon intensive future.CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) is an American energy company focused on the coal sector. The business has undergone a shift from being a majority producer of coal for domestic energy purposes to an export-driven producer of coal for non-power generation purposes. Over the last few years, the Company has delevered to a near-zero net debt position and is trading at a 25-30% unlevered free cash flow. While there is a negative stigma associated with coal (and some deserved) there are parts of the world that have limited energy alternatives and will require coal supply over the coming years. I expect the company to commit a large amount of the free cashflow to buying in cheap stock and the per share intrinsic value to grow substantially over the next 3 years.”In addition to investing in the best materials ETFs, investors can also consider investing in stocks such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

For the purposes of American stock investors, it’s most noteworthy that the amount of copper, silver, and lithium extracted and used will have to surge tremendously. This has led to the rise of basic materials stocks to buy.Over 2,800 kilograms of copper are required to generate each megawatt of onshore wind and solar panels, while 8,000 kilograms are needed to generate just one megawatt of offshore wind. Copper is also essential for conveying electricity through wires, and the amount of electricity distributed will have to greatly increase to enable the electrification of transportation.Meanwhile, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has said that silver is “crucial” for solar energy and is also utilized in electric vehicles. Finally, lithium is used to create the lithium-ion batteries that power the vast majority of today’s EVs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo here are three basic materials stocks to buy in order to exploit their use in the energy revolution.Freeport McMoran (FCX)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comIn North America alone, Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX)  operates seven copper mines. Last year, the company as a whole extracted 4.2 billion pounds of copper, representing a gain of almost 10% over 2021.FCX has pointed out that copper “is a critical metal for wire, plumbing, and hardware,” in addition to its role as the main conveyor of electricity. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to benefit from America’s increased spending on infrastructure and the onshoring trend. Additionally, the proliferation of artificial intelligence is expected to significantly increase electricity demand.Copper prices should also be lifted by China’s economic stimulus efforts. In the past, I’ve found that Beijing excels at implementing effective economic stimulus measures.Story continuesLast quarter, FCX’s top line climbed 6% versus the same period a year earlier, and analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to recover to $2.12 in 2024 from $169 in 2023.Pan American Silver (PAAS)One bar of silver has been pulled out from a larger pile.Source: ShutterstockIn the second quarter, Pan American Silver (NYSE:PAAS) produced 6 million ounces of silver, along with over 248,000 ounces of gold.For all of 2023, PAAS expects to extract 21 million to 23 million ounces of silver and 870,000 to 970,000 ounces of gold.Noting that silver is required “for the general electrification of the economy” as well as for EVs and solar panels, Bank of America estimated that the “supply deficit” of silver would reach 125% by 2030.Pan American Silver “has consistently paid dividends for the past 13 years,” and the shares currently have a significant dividend yield of 2.6%.PAAS has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 15, and analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to climb to 90 cents in 2024 from 45 cents this year.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAs I reported in a previous column, lithium miner Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) reported very impressive second-quarter results and  “hiked its earnings per share projection for the full year to $25 – $29.50, versus its previous outlook of $20.75 – $25.75. ” Moreover, its top line soared 60% in Q2 versus the same period a year earlier.The company has signed supply deals with a number of major automakers, including Ford (NYSE:F) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Additionally, the company’s revenue from providing lithium for energy storage is growing rapidly, as it expects its sales in that area to jump 30%-40% this year.Morningstar assigns ALB stock a fair value of $350, well above the stock’s current price of $184.The shares are changing hands at an extremely low forward price-earnings ratio of just 8.5, making ALB one of the best basic materials stocks to buy now.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of passive income and its benefits in today's world, and go directly to read 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. The concept of passive income is becoming increasingly popular as more people are leaning towards side jobs. A survey by Zapier from May 2022 found that 36% of Gen Xers have a side job, while 59% of Gen Zers and 61% of millennials have one. Gen Zers, in particular, make around $9,537 annually from their side gigs. These side hustles can be a very good way to supplement income, though they are not typically considered passive income sources. However, some side hustles may become more passive over time as people streamline operations, delegate tasks, or automate processes. Earlier this year, CNBC did a report on Jasmine McCall, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who makes $105,000 a month in passive income from her side hustle.Passive income typically comes from investments, assets, or activities that require minimal ongoing effort once set up. Last year’s inflation increased the appeal of passive investing in stocks, particularly dividend-paying stocks. Passive equity funds, which are primarily designed for long-term capital appreciation and wealth accumulation, are about to achieve a significant milestone. Their total assets worldwide are soon going to surpass the assets of actively managed funds, a trend that has been developing for over a decade, as reported by Societe Generale. According to James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence, passive investing has been growing consistently in the US. Currently, passive mutual funds or passive ETFs own about 19% of the shares of the typical publicly traded U.S. stock. This ownership has tripled since 2013.AI and Passive IncomeIn a recent survey conducted by GOBankingRates, people were asked about their thoughts on using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate passive income. The results were positive, with 45% of respondents expressing their interest in using AI for passive income, and an extra 8% mentioned they had already done so.Story continuesAI-focused companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can potentially help people earn passive income. The company with its expansive digital ecosystem, offers opportunities for passive income through advertising revenue for content creators on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) utilizes AI in various aspects of its business, including its e-commerce and cloud services. Earning passive income through the company can be achieved through various avenues, primarily by participating in its affiliate program, publishing ebooks on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), or utilizing Amazon's print-on-demand services.All these strategies mentioned above can help generate passive income, but investing in dividend-paying stocks is also a dependable way to make money passively. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc.

(NYSE:SSTK), Adobe Stock, or music libraries. Shutterstock remained popular among elite funds in Insider Monkey’s database, as 31 hedge funds owned stakes in the company at the end of Q2 2023, up from 25 in the previous quarter.24.

However, it is always advised to check local laws and regulations regarding room rentals. Some areas may have specific rules, permits, or taxes related to short-term rentals. Airbnb, Inc.

It involves acquiring existing websites, improving them, and then selling them for a profit.

Develop a Niche Job BoardDeveloping a niche job board refers to creating an online platform or website that specializes in listing job opportunities within a specific industry, profession, or category. Unlike general job search websites like Indeed or LinkedIn, which cover a wide range of job types and industries, a niche job board focuses on a particular niche or sector. After setting up the job board, making money by charging companies for posting job listings is a good way to earn passive income. Indeed, SimplyHired, and CareerBuilder are some of the most prominent websites that operate niche job boards.20. Sell Your NotesSelling notes typically involves creating and selling study or course materials, lecture notes, or educational content to students or learners. Well-researched, organized, and easy-to-understand notes provide real value to the target audience and are and are priced competitively.

Consistent, quality content and effective SEO can help maintain a steady flow of commissions, making it a potentially lucrative source of passive income over the long term. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s affiliates program is one of the largest and most popular. Users can promote a wide range of products on the Amazon platform and earn commissions on sales generated through your affiliate links.18. Create a Mobile AppCreating a mobile app can be a potential source of passive income. People should either create the app themselves if they have the skills or hire a developer. It is important to make sure that the app is user-friendly, well-designed, and functions smoothly. The monetization strategy works best when earning passive income.17. Purchase ATMsPurchasing ATMs involves a specific business model and understanding of the ATM industry but it can be a very reliable way to earn passive income. When someone uses the ATM to withdraw cash, they are charged a fee for convenience, a part of which goes to the ATM owner.16. Start an E-Commerce StoreStarting an e-commerce store is one of the most popular passive income ideas today. The pandemic of 2020 has boosted online shopping and income seekers are trying to make the most of this trend. According to a report on digital shopping, more than 265 million consumers in the US are expected to be shopping online in 2023. People can earn passive income by setting up an online retail business that operates with minimal day-to-day involvement once it's established. E-commerce platforms like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) can help build and host an online store. In the second quarter of 2023, Shopify generated nearly $1.7 billion in revenues, which showed a 31% growth from the same period last year.15. Peer-to-Peer Car RentalsPeer-to-peer car rental is a practice where individuals rent their private vehicles to others on a short-term basis, usually through an online platform or app. It is a profitable venture, especially if the vehicles are underutilized. However, it's crucial to provide excellent customer service, maintain your vehicles, and understand the terms and conditions of the platform you choose. Getaround, Inc. (NYSE:GETR) offers peer-to-peer car sharing in various cities in the US. Car owners can list their vehicles for rent, and renters can book them for short-term use. The company was a part of 15 hedge fund portfolios in our database at the end of Q2 2023.14. Invest in Vending MachinesVending machines are popular among people because of their convenience and ability to provide a wide range of products and services to consumers without the need for human intervention. According to a market report, the worldwide retail vending machine market was worth about $51.91 billion in 2021 and is projected to keep growing at an annual rate of about 10.7% from 2022 to 2030. Income seekers can earn passive income through vending machines by purchasing and strategically placing these machines in high-traffic areas. After initial setup, the machines can generate income with minimal ongoing effort. It is one of the best passive income ideas on our list as effective management and product selection are key to maximizing returns.13. Royalties from Intellectual PropertiesThis idea refers to payments or fees earned by the owner or creator of intellectual property (IP) for allowing others to use, license, or distribute their intellectual assets. Income seekers should ensure that their intellectual property is legally protected through copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other applicable forms of intellectual property rights.12. Sell Designs OnlineEarning passive income by selling designs online is a creative venture. Many online marketplaces allow users to develop unique and high-quality designs that cater to a specific niche or market. This can include graphic designs, illustrations, digital art, t-shirt designs, printables, or any other creative works. Some of the most prominent platforms include Etsy, Inc. (NYSE:ETSY) and Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:SSTK).11. Investing in BondsEarning passive income by investing in bonds can be a relatively low-risk way to generate regular income. To invest in bonds, income seekers can buy them directly from the issuer or in the secondary market through a brokerage account. The secondary market allows you to buy and sell bonds from other investors. Holding bonds until they mature ensures that investors receive the full face value of the bond, provided the issuer remains solvent. This approach minimizes interest rate risk. Investors will receive regular interest payments until maturity. They can also choose to reinvest the interest income they receive, compounding the returns over time. Alternatively, investors can use the interest payments as a source of passive income.10. Offer Software as a Service (SaaS) BusinessSaaS business is a model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual computers or servers, users can access and use SaaS applications through web browsers. Income seekers can earn passively after developing a valuable software product, setting up a subscription-based pricing model, and continuously attracting and retaining customers. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top SaaS companies. The company’s revenue for Q2 2023 came in at $8.6 billion, which showed an 11.4% growth from the same period last year.9. High-Yield Savings AccountsA high-yield savings account is a type of savings account offered by banks and financial institutions that typically provides a higher interest rate compared to traditional savings accounts. The account with competitive interest rates allows the power of compound interest to work for income seekers. With compounding, the interest gets added to the principal balance, allowing the savings to grow over time.8. Start a Blog or YouTube ChannelStarting a blog or YouTube channel is next on our list of the best passive income ideas. Income seekers can create content according to their own interests or expertise and monetize it through methods like display ads, affiliate marketing, and selling digital products or courses. The passive aspect comes into play once the created content gains traction by attracting viewers and readers over time.7. Create a Subscription Box ServiceThis strategy involves curating and delivering a selection of products or experiences to subscribers on a recurring basis, typically monthly. Profit seekers should select a niche or theme that resonates with their target audience and establish relationships with suppliers to create high-quality themed boxes. Effective marketing strategies are key to attracting subscribers, and once a substantial customer base comes into play, the income becomes passive as subscribers renew their subscriptions automatically.6. Automated DropshippingAutomated dropshipping is a business model in e-commerce where an online retailer (the dropshipper) sells products to customers without physically handling the inventory. Instead, the drop shipper partners with a supplier or manufacturer who handles the storage, packaging, and shipping of products directly to the customers. The primary role of income seekers revolves around marketing, customer service, and optimizing their e-commerce store. As the store gains traction, it can generate passive income through product sales and repeat customers. Click to continue reading and see 5 Passive Income Ideas to Make Money &amp; Build Wealth in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best Materials ETFs20 Best Citizenship by Investment Programs in 202312 Stocks That Will Double In 2023Disclosure.

That range had been revised upwards from $26 to $28 per share, following strong investor demand.The IPO raised $660 million based on 22 million shares sold. The shares are scheduled to start trading on Nasdaq on Tuesday.The offering is the last sign of the U.S IPO market's rebound, which was arid for most of this year and 2022, until SoftBank Group Corp's chip designer Arm floated on Nasdaq last week at a $54.5 billion fully diluted valuation.Arm's fully diluted valuation has risen to $62 billion following three days of its shares trading.Marketing automation company Klaviyo Inc on Monday increased its proposed IPO price range amid strong investor demand, targeting a fully diluted valuation of up to $9 billion when it debuts in the stock market later this week.Some investors have agreed to buy up to $400 million worth of shares sold in Instacart's IPO, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total proceeds.These investors include Norges Bank Investment Management, a division of Norges Bank, and entities affiliated with venture capital firms TCV, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and Valiant Capital Management. Sequoia and D1 Capital were existing Instacart shareholders.PepsiCo agreed to buy $175 million in preferred convertible stock.Instacart allows customers to order through its app and a ""shopper"" delivers the product in as little as 30 minutes. Its business has been more muted since the pandemic subsided, though it is trending up.Story continuesFor the six months ended June 30, Instacart's revenue came in at $1.48 billion, up 31% from the same period last year.Advertising and other revenue surged 24% to $406 million. It reported net income of $242 million during the six-month period, compared to a $74 million loss a year earlier. Boasting it is now profitable was key to Instacart attracting risk-averse investors.Instacart has expanded its delivery business to non-grocery goods from sellers such as beauty product retailer Sephora, convenience store 7-Eleven and pharmacy chain CVS Health .More than 1,400 national, regional and local retail banners that collectively represent more than 85% of the U.S. grocery market partner with Instacart, the company has said.

The first half of the month has maintained the trend. U.S. stock markets faced the first major setback in August after an impressive bull run in the first seven months of 2023. The volatile trading pattern of August continued in the first half of September.Volatility May Continue in the Near FutureMonth to date, the three major stock indexes – the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – are down 0.3%, 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Market participants are uncertain about Fed’s future move on monetary policies. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted two consecutive weeks of decline.At present, the CME FedWatch is showing a 98% probability that the central bank will keep the interest rate unchanged at the existing rate of 5.25-5.5% in its FOMC meeting scheduled next week. Notably, this is the highest Fed fund rate since March 20021.However, there exists a 28% probability that the benchmark interest rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points or more in the November FOMC meeting. In this regard, the post- FOMC meeting statement of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will have immense importance.Higher interest rate is affecting the U.S. banking sector. U.S. banks are currently under rating watch. Last month, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Additionally, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade.Fitch Ratings warned that it might downgrade the ratings of more than a dozen U.S. heavyweight banks in the near future. Moreover, S&amp;P Global cut credit ratings on some regional lenders with high commercial real estate exposure.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If the markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential.

(AP) — Investigators say the blast that prompted evacuations near Union Pacific's massive railyard in western Nebraska last week appears to be accidental, but it's not yet clear what caused it.The Nebraska State Fire Marshal's office is working with the railroad and experts from the Federal Railroad Administration to determine what caused a stationary container carrying perchloric acid that can be used to make explosives as well as a variety of food and drug products to explode last Thursday in North Platte.The chief investigator for the fire marshal’s office, Adam Matzner, said Tuesday that investigators haven’t found any sign of a criminal act connected with the explosion, so the incident appears accidental. But the investigation is ongoing.A spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said Tuesday that he couldn’t provide any additional details about the agency’s investigation.Union Pacific spokeswoman Kristen South said the railroad is cooperating with the state and federal agencies while conducting its own review of what happened and how rail employees responded to find ways to improve how it responds to future incidents.The local fire chief has said he doesn't expect any lingering issues or contamination concerns related to the explosion and fire because the acid inside the shipping container largely burned off and any residue was contained at the scene. The fire didn't spread beyond the container that was sitting on top of the one that exploded, and air monitoring didn't show toxic levels of chemicals.An area of about a one-mile radius around where the explosion happened in the west end of Union Pacific's Bailey Yard was evacuated for several hours Thursday afternoon as a precaution, but because the fire happened near the edge of the city of about 23,000 people only a small number of homes were affected. North Platte is located about 230 miles (370 kilometers) east of Denver and about 250 miles (400 kilometers) west of Omaha.The North Platte explosion did generate thick smoke that concerned authorities, but the impact was nothing like the massive fiery Norfolk Southern derailment that happened in eastern Ohio in February. That crash in East Palestine, Ohio, generated nationwide concerns about railroad safety and calls for reforms.Union Pacific is one of the nation's largest railroads with more than 32,000 miles (nearly 51,500 kilometers) of track crisscrossing 23 Western states.]"

Let's turn awareness into meaningful change, ensuring railroad tracks are for trains, not tragedies.""In many communities, areas near train tracks are a popular place for young people to ""hang out."" Many people, including kids and adults, walk along the tracks, cut across them as a short cut, and pose for group photos and selfies without knowing the facts about trains:Trains are at least three feet wider than the tracks on either side.Modern trains are quieter than people might think.Once a train starts to brake, it can take up to a mile for the train to completely stop.In the decade between 2013 and 2022, more than 500 children died of rail-related injuries and nearly 1,200 were injured. Trespass incidents make up 67 percent of these fatalities and 50 percent of the nonfatal injuries.Story continuesNotably, teens, ages 15-19, are the age group most frequently impacted by trespassing incidents, which inspired Safe Kids and Union Pacific to create the ""Take it from a Teen"" Video challenge, a special opportunity for teenagers to educate their fellow teens about critical rail safety information. The winning video was produced by Josie McCue, from Reno Nevada. In addition to the ""Take it from a Teen"" Challenge, Safe Kids and Union Pacific are sharing the following resources, materials, and tips to educate parents, teens, and younger kids and create a community of rail safety advocates.Rail Safety Educator Kit for teachers and librarians to help educate and entertain younger kids. Each kit consists of a large print version of Clifford and the Railroad Crossing to facilitate story time and teach children how to be safe around railroad tracks.The ""Rail Safety Station,"" available at safekids.org/RailSafetyStation, is an online hub with sharable content for educators, community partners, parents, and caregivers. Rail Safety Tips, to help prevent railroad-related injuries:Only cross train tracks at a designated crossing. Designated crossings are marked by a sign, lights, or a gate.If lights are flashing or the gate is down at a railroad crossing, wait for the train to pass completely, the gates to lift and the lights to stop flashing before crossing the tracks. Allow enough space for your vehicle to completely clear the entire railroad crossing, not just the tracks, before you attempt to cross. If you are using a cell phone, headphones or playing a game, remember: heads up, devices down when you cross the tracks. Don't walk along the train tracks. It might be a shortcut, but it is dangerous and not worth the risk. It is also against the law to walk on the track and the land around it because it is private property.About Safe Kids WorldwideSafe Kids Worldwide is a nonprofit organization working to reduce unintentional injuries to children ages 0-14 and build equitable and sustained systems that support injury prevention.

This blog features Cisco's partnership with Fairfood, a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the Netherlands. If you are interested in a deep dive on this partnership, please contact Sue-Lynn Hinson.New research by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization shows that the world's nearly 500 million smallholder farmers produce around one third of the world's food supply. Yet many of them live on less than USD $2 per day and can barely feed and sustain their own families. Fair and ethical business practices are a rising concern among consumers; yet many agri-food companies struggle to build brand trust and prove that they are operating sustainably, treating farmers and food workers ethically and paying them a living income.Fairfood has developed a blockchain-based technology platform called Trace with support from Cisco. Trace enables full transparency across the food supply chain, and provides data, evidence, and insights with which companies can develop programs and strategies to implement ethical business practices and improve the lives and livelihoods of smallholder farmers and food workers.""The relationship between the buyer and the producer, to me, is the most important. It is good to have this transparency inside the cooperative; to be able to show what we are doing with the coffee, every step of the process. It helps build strong and dependable relationships with buyers."" -Jos&amp;eacute; Francisco Villada (Panchito), Coffee producer and co-founder of CapucasFairfood's mission is to accelerate change towards fair and sustainable food value chains, partnering with agri-food companies to develop innovative business models that benefit companies and cooperatives and enable fair value distribution models that lead to higher incomes for smallholder farmers. Currently connecting more than 300,000 people (farmers, workers and their family members) to the domestic and international supply chains that shape their future, Fairfood's global operations span 17 countries and diverse commodities related to the cocoa, coffee, spice, horticultural and fruit industries.Story continuesFairfood's partnership director, Peter van der Linde, shares the non-profit's technology evolution and how its partnership with Cisco has helped it make significant advancements in digital inclusion while protecting data privacy and security and giving smallholder farmers control over their own digital information.What role does technology play in Fairfood's mission?Technology and digital inclusion are key. Having technology that can help securely trace the product from farmer to consumer, end to end, is invaluable to bringing positive change to fair and ethical food sustainability, building brand trust among consumers through supply chain transparency, and helping us scale to market. Getting everyone on board, from the farmers to the cooperatives, to the brands, retailers, and consumers, is vital to creating real change.Fairfood adopts a partnership value chain approach to traceability, forming data partnerships along international food corridors that benefit all parties, with a strong focus on strengthening the position of farmers as a key part of sustainability strategies. Fairfood's approach is unique because it is focused on system change and centered on both product traceability and publicly verifiable brand promises that can be linked to individual products that add tangible value in the commercial market and help to build consumer trust. And the technical infrastructure that is backed by the partnership with Cisco is essential.How has the support of Cisco contributed to Fairfood's technology development and how critical has this been in advancing your strategy?With the support of Cisco, Fairfood has strengthened its farmer-centric traceability solution that currently allows 46 companies to show exactly where products come from and share evidence for brand promises publicly, while improving farmers' incomes. The partnership also allowed us to develop a data-secure NFC (Near Field Communication) card system in combination with a mobile app for first buyers, that enables the development of financial track records for farmers and community members who do not have a phone or a bank account. It is used to securely digitize proof of cash payments offline, ensuring financial transactions can only be verified by the authorized users.In the markets Fairfood operates in, this concept shifts the power back to farmers and community members, allowing them to verify that payments intended for them are received, while ensuring they remain in control of their own data. It also opens up the possibility to use these records for financial inclusion for farmers that do not have a bank account. ""We are exploring ways in which these digital financial track records can be used for credit scoring to help secure basic loans for these farmers that were previously out of scope. It's a massive opportunity with a lot of potential and benefit to both the unbanked farmers and financial institutions"".What are some of Fairfood's accomplishments/wins in the industry to date?Fairfood has a goal to improve the livelihoods of one million people by 2025. One of the ways we are making strides to achieve this goal is through novel business models. In 2022, Fairfood implemented its farmer-centric traceability solution with Verstegen Spices in their nutmeg supply chain from Indonesia, with a new incentive structure wherein farmers are paid a premium for top-quality product, and additionally compensated for providing digital verification of payments received. The program had two pathways of change: one aimed at demonstrating the business case for fully traceable nutmeg products, and the other focused on showcasing the potential of incentives to help structurally increase payments to farmers. The case got highlighted in the report &amp;lsquo;Towards a New Paradigm' commissioned by USAID (DDI) and the Gates Foundation.Watch a short video about the program.The report highlights that after the initial hybrid financing model (public-private), key parties in the value chain are willing to continue to cover the running costs of the app/card system and sustain payments for both quality and data premiums. Farmer verified transaction records show that the quality and data premiums continued to result in an approximately $100 increase in income per farmer per year during the first year after implementation (March 2022 - March 2023).Learn how Trace is enabling full transparency for the supply chain.What challenges/roadblocks does Fairfood still face?One of the biggest challenges Fairfood faces is to prove the business case for fully traceable products, instead of the market depending on current sustainability labels. We know that some of these labels can be misleading, and many do not prove that farmers are being paid fairly (despite consumers thinking that is what these labels mean). So, bringing our farmer-centric traceability system and approaches to the forefront is key to making real change towards sustainable and ethical food supply chains, consumer awareness, and brand trust. It takes time for people to really understand the power of farm-to-fork traceability, but we are beginning to make inroads.Another challenge is with legislation. Up until a few years ago, there was a lack of legislation around ethical and sustainable supply chains. We are now seeing positive change in this area across governments in several countries and this is helping us to pick up steam in companies where sustainability was not previously mission-critical to them. A final roadblock area is the lack of data, and this is where we are partnering with our cooperatives to help them to digitize paper-based processes, for example enhancing their farmer lists and by supporting them with means to digitize transaction records using our app and card system. Sometimes it is starting from scratch, but as we collect data through the Trace platform, we can facilitate real change throughout the supply chain and help to make sure that farmers are paid fairly for their products.How can consumers help Fairfood's mission?There are multiple ways consumers can help with Fairfood's mission towards a sustainable food system.Education: Learn about what companies are supporting ethical and sustainable food practices. Being an informed, responsible consumer can help to influence the system as a whole and lead to real, actionable change. Visit the Fairfood website for more information.Enjoy coding?
