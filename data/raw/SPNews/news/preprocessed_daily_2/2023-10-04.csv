The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that STM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears. Some companies pay dividends, but they haven't consistently kept up with them, and some have even reduced or stopped paying them altogether. For this reason, companies that consistently raise their dividends are favored by investors. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

A calculation of this measure is available in this news release.The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures.

AYI will announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Oct 4, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6% and increased 6.5% year over year. The top line lagged the consensus mark by 3.5% and declined 5.7% from the year-ago period’s levels.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing 13 quarters.The Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has increased to $3.57 from $3.55 in the past seven days. The projected figure indicates a decline of 9.6% from $3.95 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.02 billion, suggesting an 8.3% decline from the year-ago reported figure of $1.11 billion.Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Acuity Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Acuity Brands Inc QuoteFactors to NoteAcuity Brands’s fiscal fourth quarter top line is expected to have declined year over year due to lower sales within the Acuity Brands Lighting or ABL segment, consistent with lead-time normalization trends and the impact of the wider macro-environment. However, focus on enhancing product vitality, elevating service levels and benefits of its technological enhancements and new product innovation are expected to offset the adverse effects of the headwinds partially.Segment-wise, for the to-be-reported quarter, our model predicts total ABL segment revenues to decline 8.3% year over year to $967.8 million. The decline in the independent sales network and lower OEM sales will likely affect the segment’s revenue.Within the ABL segment, we expect Independent Sales Network, Direct Sales Network, Corporate Accounts, Other revenues to decline 6.4%, 7.8%, 24.1% and 21.6% year over year to $690.2, $106, $55.4, and $67.4 million, respectively.The company has gained from its diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries. Focus on Intelligent Spaces Group or ISG products specialized in providing products and services that enhance the intelligence, safety, and sustainability of spaces bodes well. Our model predicts ISG segment revenues in the fourth quarter to increase 5.2% year over year to $64.6 million.Meanwhile, higher raw material and freight costs will likely put some pressure on the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter margins. The company is going through supply chain challenges and higher costs for some components. Our model predicts the adjusted operating margin in the fourth-quarter to decline 80 basis points year over year to 14.5%.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Acuity Brands this time around.

The company's recent reaffirmation of its strong BBB+ credit rating with a positive outlook by S&amp;P Global Ratings underscores its financial strength, creditworthiness and position as a preeminent player in the life science real estate industry.However, reflecting broader market concerns, shares of ARE were down 1.92% during yesterday’s trading session.Alexandria boasts a significant liquidity of $6.3 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, which provides valuable flexibility for executing its unique life science real estate platform. With no debt maturities until 2025 and 99.2% of debt at fixed rates, Alexandria's balance sheet is a testament to its financial prudence.Moreover, the weighted-average remaining debt term of 13.4 years as of Jun 30, 2023 is one of the longest among all U.S. REITs. This extended debt profile ensures stability and minimizes refinancing risks, further bolstering Alexandria's appeal to investors seeking long-term security.The reaffirmed BBB+ credit rating reflects the scale and quality of Alexandria's Labspace assets, which are strategically aggregated into mega campuses concentrated in high-barrier-to-entry markets. These assets are in high demand due to the robust, long-term fundamentals of the life science sector.The company's credit rating is also supported by a diverse and high-quality client base of ARE, which drives growing revenues, stable cash flows and strong margins. Alexandria's triple-net lease structure, with annual rent escalations covering 96% of its leases, ensures steady income streams and mitigates risks associated with variable expenses.Alexandria’s Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations are experiencing high demand, aiding occupancy levels and rent growth. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 2.5 million RSF of space, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to nearly 2.2 million RSF.As of Jun 30, 2023, the occupancy of Alexandria’s operating properties in North America remained high at 93.6%. It registered rental rate growth of 35.1% during the six months ended Jun 30, 2023.Given the healthy demand for its premium assets, this upbeat trend is likely to continue in the upcoming period, driving solid organic growth. For 2023, we expect Alexandria’s same-store occupancy to be 94.8%. Rental income is expected to grow 9.7% and 10.2% on a year-over-year basis in 2023 and 2024, respectively.However, given the persistent macroeconomic uncertainty, the company’s huge development pipeline exposes it to the risk of cost overruns and lease-up concerns. High interest rates add to its woes. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 15.4% in the past six months, wider than its industry’s fall of 10.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s 2023 FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $3.55.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Americold Realty Trust’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $1.26.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

He Plans to Fix It.Kevin McCarthy Ousted as US House Speaker by Republican DissidentsThe Wall Street giant is wagering that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at least a full percentage point next year — double what markets are pricing in — as policy makers respond to further slowing in growth and inflation.“The Fed fund rate needs to drop pretty dramatically next year,” Lori Heinel, Boston-based chief investment officer at the firm, said in an interview. “We think at least four rate cuts — so 100 basis points and maybe as much as 200.”The $3.6 trillion asset manager has bought more longer-dated Treasuries in anticipation, she said.Heinel contends that the Fed is done with its hiking cycle and that policy is restrictive enough, given the lag with which tightening filters through. On this basis, she forecasts the US economic growth slowing to 1.1% next year, with the inflation rate moderating to just below 3%.“That will give us room to get longer yields back to a more appropriate risk premium,” she added. “We are buyers of rates here, there’s good value.”The contrarian view counters the higher-for-longer expectations dominating markets, which led traders to pare bets on next year’s Fed rate cuts from 150 basis points a couple of months ago to half-a-point now.The shift in narrative sparked a fierce selloff in long dated bonds and drove yields to multi-year highs, with the US 30-year rate reaching the highest level since 2007 on Tuesday.BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink, Pershing Square Capital’s Bill Ackman and JPMorgan Asset Management’s Bob Michele are among those seeing higher yields as here to stay.

Meanwhile, she has switched to underweight on European equities, given the region’s energy vulnerability and maintains a negative outlook on Asia, considering China’s disappointing post-pandemic recovery.“We’re going to see a slowing environment and central bankers are going to finally feel like they’ve done enough,” she said. “That will give rates room to run the way that we think they should.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekCan AI Beat the Market?

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Qorvo basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Qorvo, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for QorvoThis chipmaker is expected to earn $5.15 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of -13%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Qorvo. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Qorvo to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) share price is 163% higher than it was three years ago. That sort of return is as solid as granite. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 17% gain in the last three months.While the stock has fallen 3.3% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.CF Industries Holdings was able to grow its EPS at 92% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 38% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 6.66 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that CF Industries Holdings has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling CF Industries Holdings stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, CF Industries Holdings' TSR for the last 3 years was 181%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveCF Industries Holdings shareholders are down 20% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 11%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for CF Industries Holdings   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

With this, 2023 marked the fourth year in a row that the S&amp;P 500 logged losses in September, per data from Deutsche Bank.Fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period took the sheen away from stocks in the month. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, shed 3.1% last month. Despite the losses, some stocks in the ETF stood tall.We have highlighted five stocks that are in green and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). These include Centene Corporation CNC, WestRock WRK, CF Industries Holdings Inc CF, Valero Energy VLO and Charter Communications CHTR.The Fed, in its latest meeting, kept interest rates steady at a 22-year high, in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled one more hike this year. Though inflation is easing, it remains elevated and above the Fed’s 2% target (read: Bet on Quality ETFs as Fed Keeps Rate Steady, View Hawkish).Meanwhile, the latest bouts of weak economic data have sparked fears of a slowdown. U.S. consumer sentiment slipped for the second straight month in September as the University of Michigan's preliminary reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 67.7 from the final reading of 69.5 in August. Meanwhile, new home sales declined 8.7% in August from July and home prices continued to ascend, with the Case-Shiller Index growing 1% year over year in July.  Further, the combination of a steadily appreciating U.S. dollar, escalating yields, and surging oil prices presents a trio of challenges that could potentially impede the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy, posing concerns for investors. In fact, surging oil prices threaten to revive inflationary pressure. Moreover, Wall Street is grappling with global economic uncertainties, U.S. auto workers' strike that may intensify inflation, and the reinstatement of U.S. student loan repayments that could impact household spending.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Popular Small Towns to Live in the US.The Ideal Small TownThe tightly knit community life in a small town in America has a lot to offer. These American small towns typically have a lower population than metropolitan areas. Being in close proximity to major cities, these towns offer an urban-suburban feel. A small town that is deemed a popular place to live is one that offers all basic amenities to its residents such as housing, education, healthcare, and safety. A good standard of living implies that the residents can afford to own or rent out their own living space, feel safe to walk around the town, and have access to medical care and sufficient employment opportunities to sustain a livelihood. You can also take a look at the best American suburbs for retirees.According to the most recent census reported by the US Census Bureau in 2020, there were 3,143 counties in the country that were rural. Almost 60% of the counties were considered either totally or partially rural by this census survey. Approximately 13.4 million children under the age of 18 resided in a rural space in 2020, thereby representing a potential future generation. Considering these statistics, it is evident that a major portion of the country lies outside big urban centers. Thus, the scope of small towns even when they contain a smaller population is extensive. Companies Promoting Quality Life in Small TownsThere are a diverse set of companies in the United States that improve the standard of life in small towns. They serve the residents of these small towns by fulfilling their needs. Since these companies operate in different industries, we have focused on some of them. These include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) from retail, Princeton Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:BPRN) from banking and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) from healthcare.Story continuesWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a popular retail chain in the United States. The company pursues a strategy of positioning itself in small towns in the US, even where the population is relatively less. The company's strategy focuses on placing discount stores in small towns. These stores bring employment opportunities and the ease of shopping from nearby for the town's residents. On April 4, the company reported its growth strategy for 2023. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is striving to improve its supply chain by integrating automation and innovation into it. The company also demonstrated this supply chain innovation at its regional distribution center in Brooksville, which is a small American town, and how the distribution center could engage in increased item storage by inculcating data, software, and robotics in its supply chain system thereby delivering to the company’s stores efficiently. By 2026, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects to have 65% of its stores serviced automatically.Another popular company operating in Princeton town is The Bank of Princeton, a wholly owned subsidiary of Princeton Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:BPRN). The bank offers financial services across Central New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. The bank also holds three branches in Princeton thereby helping the residents with their banking needs. On May 19, the company reported that it has acquired Noah Bank. The company is currently also operating in other small towns such as Browns Mills, Chesterfield, Cream Ridge, and Hamilton.Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) tends to transform suburban life in America by providing pharmaceutical products. Its US headquarters is in Plainsboro township in New Jersey, which also shares a border with Princeton. The company continues to make healthcare accessible in the country. On June 20, the company reported that it has been taking actions against retailers of non-FDA approved semaglutide medicines with the use of its trademark. Legal actions have been initiated by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) against local pharmacies, medical spas, and other retailers to protect US consumers from buying medicines that are neither authentic nor safe for their health.Thus, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Princeton Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:BPRN), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) add to the local amenities that can be accessed easily by the residents of small American towns.MethodologyIn order to compile a list of the most popular small towns in the US, we referred to the Niche Best Places to Live ranking. We chose ‘towns’ as our filter to find all the American towns. From the results, we screened towns with a population under 50,000, thereby representing small towns. Since the population requirements as stated by the US Census Bureau for towns within different US states vary and large cities typically have populations greater than 50,000, we have considered all those towns which have populations under 50,000. Thus, we shortlisted the top 50 small towns from Niche.Moving on, we decided to select the metrics that could best define a popular town to live in the US. Based on our hypothesis, a popular small town in America for a living should have a good quality of life. Thus, the town should offer affordable housing costs, reasonable income, and educational institutes since housing affordability, employment, and education are the basic concerns of residents in any place.To denote house affordability, we selected mean house price as our primary metric. For our secondary metric representing employment, we chose mean household income. For the number of schools as our tertiary metric, we compiled all public and private schools in the town. This data was sourced from town profiles on Niche.Finally, we ranked the small towns in the US according to their mean house prices, mean household income, and number of schools, on a priority basis as stated above.Let's take a look at some of the most popular small towns for living in America.25 Most Popular Small Towns to Live in the US25 Most Popular Small Towns to Live in the US:25.

Consequently, retailers proactively tackle logistical and inventory challenges, devising comprehensive strategies to ensure a seamless shopping experience, both in physical stores and online.To cater to consumers' product preferences, retailers focus on restocking shelves with high-demand merchandise and significantly invest in digitization. These efforts are expected to lead to the hiring of numerous seasonal associates who will play pivotal roles in managing curbside and in-store pickups of online orders, as well as doorstep deliveries.However, this holiday season might not be as exuberant as before, given that consumers are adopting a more cautious approach regarding their disposable income. They are grappling with various economic challenges, including inflation, elevated interest rates, the impending return of student loan obligations and depleting savings.As the once easily spent ""discretionary dollar"" becomes harder for consumers to part with, retailers must adapt to this evolving landscape. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are expected to increase 3.7% from the previous year during the traditional holiday period spanning from Nov 1 to Dec 24. To put this into context, holiday sales grew 7.6% last year.That said, we have highlighted four stocks from the Retail - Wholesale sector that look well-positioned based on their sound fundamentals.Past-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research4 Prominent PicksUrban Outfitters URBN is worth betting on.

The fourth quarter of any year historically remains favorable to U.S. stock markets as it deals with the holiday season. Notably, during the holiday season the retail sector gets maximum importance. This year too, the scenario remains the same.Retail sales have not been impacted much due to record-high inflationary pressures. U.S. consumption expenditure stayed buoyant despite the Fed pursuing an extremely high interest rate regime in the last one and a half years.Research firm Deloitte estimated that the total holiday retail sales in 2023 will be in the range of $1.54 to $1.56 trillion during the November to January timeframe. This marks an year-over-year improvement of 3.5% to 4.6% in 2023. Deloitte also forecast that within the total holiday retail sales, e-commerce sales will account for $278 billion to $284 billion. This marks a year-over-year improvement of 10.3% to 12.8%.Mastercard SpendingPulse estimated that holiday retail sales (excluding automotive) between Nov 1 and Dec 24, are expected to increase 3.7% year over year. E-commerce and online sales are likely to grow 6.7% and 2.9%, respectively.Bain &amp; Company forecasts nominal U.S. retail sales to grow 3% year over year in November and December, reaching nearly $915 billion, with 90% of the growth coming from non-store (e-commerce and mail-order) sales.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five retail giants that have strong growth potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has been benefiting from a strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate has contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio are positives for AMZN. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is also encouraging. Its advertising business is also making a robust contribution. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds for AMZN.Story continuesZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.1% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 43.9% over the last 60 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. Increased market share in grocery continued to boost U.S. comps in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Strong comps growth globally, expense leverage and e-commerce growth across all units favored the company. WMT raised its guidance for fiscal 2024.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.3% and 2.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.Ross Stores Inc. ROST has benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings. ROST has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years.ROST operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores, which target value-conscious men and women, aged 25 to 54 in middle-to-upper middle-class households. ROST has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios.Zacks Rank #1 Ross Stores has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 19.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the last 60 days.Lithia Motors Inc.’s LAD diversified product mix and multiple streams of income reduce its risk profile and position it for long-term sales and profit growth. LAD is on a buyout spree, which is increasing its market share.Enhanced digital solutions — including the Driveway e-commerce program — are helping LAD to further boost profitability and market presence. Driveway generated $900 million in revenues in 2022 and expects to hit $9 billion in annual revenues by 2025, thus paving the path for LAD’s rapid growth.Zacks Rank #1 Lithia Motors has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.6% and 1.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s BABA solid momentum across the China and international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. Notably, China commerce retail business is driven by rising online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall. Further, International retail business is riding on solid combined order growth.BABA’s strength across the Cainiao logistics services, owing to robust domestic consumer logistics and international fulfillment solution services is a plus. This apart, cloud computing business and local services are acting as tailwinds. Considering these factors, we expect total revenues of BABA to grow 8.2% in fiscal 2024 from fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank #1 Alibaba Group Holding has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.7% and 14.9%, respectively, for the current year (ending March 2024).

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Morgan Stanley slashing price targets and earnings estimates for cruise lines. This coming amid higher fuel costs and currency headwinds. Shares of Norwegian, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean all in the red. That we should mention, Julie, I mean, some of these names have had some monster runs this year, too. They may be in the red, but I'm just looking at Carnival, for example, it is up nearly 60% this year. And most analysts cover that name still think you should own it.But again, also, there a bigger idea that is the consumer to the extent they get a little nervous. And we even hear guests on today's show say, some believe that's going to happen. If you think that, then maybe consumer discretionary names could come under some pressure here.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, and two notes here. So you mentioned it's consumer discretionary names, which, as I said, is the worst performing group in the S&amp;P 500 today. Cruise lines are part of the reason why. I think the question that has really come to the fore in investors' minds now with a lot of these companies, how long is it going to last?You know, we have had the good times, as you mentioned, right? People have been traveling. People have continued to spend money. We talked to Kevin Mahn of Hennion &amp; Walsh earlier in the show. And he was raising just that question, right? Are people savings starting to work down? Are they going to continue to have a job, get a raise at the same rate, et cetera?Story continuesAnd these are-- now, it might be that it will continue. It's continued longer already than a lot of people expected. But these questions are really, you know, one of the things--JOSH LIPTON: Listen, it's why you're watching the labor market the way you are, right, because, at the end of the day, low unemployment sub-4% and strong wage gains, that's why you're waiting for any cracks in that market.JULIE HYMAN: Yes. We're seeing a few cracks today, it feels like. One of the other places where we're seeing that manifest is in recently spun-off companies. So far-- and a lot of these spin-offs have been happening in just the past few days, right? So you've got Vestis Corporation, which was a spin-off from Aramark. The big food services company, this, I believe, is the apparel part of that. Veralto Corporation spun off from Danaher. And then WK Kellogg, of course, spinning off from Kellogg, which is now Kellanova.And so all of these since we saw, the spin-offs have been underperforming. And, you know, I think there are some specifics with these companies. But I think there is also just this broader I don't want to take any risk in this market of attitude manifesting in the past few days.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, that's right. And also, listen, I mean, company can make its case about why a spin-off makes sense. I mean, Kellogg can say, look, we're going to spin off Froot Loops. And it's going to get narrow and focus and not distracted by the Eggo Waffles. That doesn't mean that the Street or investors are necessarily going to buy it or at least immediately.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, exactly. You know, maybe they wanted that growth that came with the snacks business that is not happening in the cereal business.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: We'll see what happens.JOSH LIPTON: And finally, Eli Lilly to buy radio pharmaceutical company Point Biopharma global for $1.4 billion. The acquisition aiming to expand Eli Lilly's oncology capabilities and next-generation radial gland therapies. And Eli Lilly, of course, Julie, has been on a tear this year. Of course, that's on the potential of weight loss drugs and Alzheimer's. But clearly, building out this oncology portfolio as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And we see Eli Lilly shares moving down. On a day like this, it's tough to suss out what's from this deal versus what's from the overall downdraft. I did see a little chatter on the part of analysts that at $12.50 per share. This is sort of the upper end of the price that analysts were expecting. So perhaps some questions over the premium that Eli Lilly is paying in this case. And that might be contributing to some of the drop in the shares. But again, on a day like this, when so much of the market is down, it's tough to--JOSH LIPTON: There's a lot of cross-currents. I will say, folks are also pointing out that Fusion Pharmaceuticals surging today. And that's a peer to Point Biopharma. So many people are trying to sniff out the next target.]"

One such stock that merits attention is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH). The stock, which is currently priced at 15.86, recorded a loss of 3.56% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 26.97%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.24, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnveiling the Potential RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.22, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesDecoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company SnapshotNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's historical data, 2021: -0.13; 2022: -0.33; 2023: -0.38, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 28.67; 2020: 21.68; 2021: 0.08; 2022: 5.74; 2023: 16.54; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-32%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.ConclusionGiven the company's consistent decline in revenues and earnings, coupled with its low Altman Z-score, it seems that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings may indeed be a value trap. While the stock's low price-to-GF-Value ratio may initially appear attractive, a deep dive into the company's financial health paints a different picture. This underlines the importance of thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is MetLife (MET). MET is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.08. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 7.79. Over the last 12 months, MET's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.27 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 7.36.MET is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.54. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MET's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.67. Within the past year, MET's PEG has been as high as 5.74 and as low as 0.22, with a median of 0.59.Another notable valuation metric for MET is its P/B ratio of 1.58. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.37. Over the past year, MET's P/B has been as high as 2.47 and as low as 1.16, with a median of 1.61.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. MET has a P/S ratio of 0.66. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.72.Investors could also keep in mind MGIC Investment (MTG), an Insurance - Multi line stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of MGIC Investment currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 7.05, and its PEG ratio is 1.41. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 7.79 and 0.67.MTG's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 7.70 and as low as 4.53, with a median of 6.29, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.54 and as low as 0.91, with a median of 1.26, all within the past year.Furthermore, MGIC Investment holds a P/B ratio of 0.97 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.37. MTG's P/B has been as high as 1.05, as low as 0.79, with a median of 0.89 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that MetLife and MGIC Investment are likely undervalued currently.

Other catalysts include an increase in their volume of retirees (42%) and favorable annuity buyout market pricing (35%).Taking ActionAccording to the Poll, plan sponsors are taking concrete, proactive steps to prepare for potential future transactions. A majority of plan sponsors, 94%, report that their company is weighing their DB plan’s value against the cost of the benefit. Ninety-one percent of plan sponsors say the company’s DB plan is receiving significant attention from corporate management.In addition to assessing the value of the benefit, over the past two years plan sponsors have also taken practical steps to ready their plan for derisking. These steps include improving their plan’s data quality (58%), increasing plan contributions (56%), having their C-suite executives more involved in DB plan management (37%), and offering a lump sum distribution to terminated-vested participants (24%).Story continuesPlanned PRT ActivityWhen they are ready to transact, the Poll found almost 58% of plan sponsors will use an annuity buyout, either on its own or in combination with a lump sum. Only 18% will use an annuity buy-in. Among those seeking an annuity buyout, about half of plan sponsors (49%) will do a buyout through a retiree lift-out, while only 21% of plan sponsors say it is due to plan termination activity.Paths to DeriskingAccording to the Poll, more than three-quarters of plan sponsors, 77%, are aware that they have the ability to split a single annuity buyout transaction with more than one insurer and, if the transaction were sizable enough, a majority, 88%, say they would split their transaction.""Split deals make sense for very large and complex transactions and we are likely to see more interest in these types of deals moving forward,"" says Walsh. ""The Poll found that the average size annuity buyout transaction would need to be above $400 million for plan sponsors to consider splitting it.""When asked about how they would approach their derisking activity, more than half of plan sponsors surveyed plan to transfer risk through a series of annuity buyout transactions (55%) versus a single annuity buyout transaction (45%).About the StudyThe MetLife 2023 Pension Risk Transfer Poll was fielded between July 5 and July 27, 2023. MetLife commissioned MMR Research Associates, Inc. to conduct the online survey. Survey responses were received from 250 DB plan sponsors with $100 million or more in plan assets who have de-risking goals. This included 41% of plan sponsors who reported DB plan assets of $500 million or more.

The country's 30-year yield climbed to its latest 12-year high.Even Japan's 10-year yield, which is capped by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), rose 4.5 bps to a decade high despite the BOJ offering to buy $4.5 billion worth of bonds on Wednesday.Australian, Canadian and British government bond yields have also surged this week.""It's a very difficult market,"" said Sandrine Perret, multi-asset portfolio manager at Unigestion.""It is all back to yields, that's the main driver of markets. The pivot that most investors were expecting in September has not come yet - that's the big driver of all market pricing at the moment.""The moves in bond markets sucked money from all corners into dollars.Still, the dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, eased 0.3%, helping European stocks turn positive after losing as much as 0.6%. Asian shares sank to 11-month lows.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.2%. On Wall Street, S&amp;P 500 futures eked out gains of 0.1% after earlier trading down 0.5%.Story continuesEarlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had fallen 1%, its second straight daily drop of over 1%.U.S. yields in real terms - subtracting inflation - are also at almost 15-year highs, in part because their move has not come with much of a shift in market gauges of inflation expectations.""With the risk-free rate so high, it's not really compelling for people to allocate away from short-term cash-like investments,"" said Mel Siew, a portfolio manager at Muzinich &amp; Co in Singapore.THE DOLLAR'S MARCHThe yen was just on the stronger side of 150 per dollar on Wednesday, after an unexpected but short-lived surge in the previous session stoked speculation that Japanese authorities may have intervened to support the currency.The Japanese currency had breached the 150-per-dollar level on Tuesday before suddenly shooting to 147.3. There was no confirmation from Tokyo, where Japan's finance minister and top currency diplomat have made no direct comment on the move.The yen last stood at 149.10 per dollar.The dollar's march pushed the euro to its lowest in 10 months at $1.0448 overnight and sterling to a seven-month trough at $1.20535.The euro last traded at $1.05, up 0.3% on the day. The pound was up a similar amount at $1.212.""For now, the FX market is a bystander,"" said SocGen strategist Kit Juckes, ""watching Treasuries and waiting for them to break something.""Federal Reserve officials see rising yields on long-term U.S. Treasury debt as not triggering alarm bells yet.In commodity markets, the firm dollar has helped put the brakes on oil prices and higher yields have weighed on gold.Brent crude oil futures were down 1.7% to $89.38 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.8% to $87.67 per barrel.(Reporting by Tom Wilson in London; additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Sydney; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Mark Potter)]"

The suit claimed that the firms, along with others, manipulated the VIX index in 2018, which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to investment funds that bought options contracts tied to the benchmark.There were claims that the defendants flashed tens of thousands of quotes for out-of-the-money SPX options in February 2018, which were quickly canceled. The defendants were, hence, accused of influencing calculations of the volatility index by Cboe Global Markets, which is the exchange that sets it.Plaintiff Two Roads Shared Trust claimed that its preservation fund had lost $340 million on the day of the incident and then another $180 million when it was forced to close out its options positions at artificial and inflated levels.However, U.S. District Judge Manish S. Shah ruled that accuser LJM Partners Ltd. had not adequately alleged that it was injured. Also, claims by Two Roads Shared Trust are not valid as they were barred by the statute of limitations.MS, Barclays Capital and others have jointly said that the claims by the plaintiffs are false and “fatally flawed.”In a separate filing, Morgan Stanley said that it was improbable that the bank, acting as a market maker, would manipulate the VIX index to benefit an outright proprietary long position and that its revenues on VIX-linked instruments were “from facilitating customer orders during a period of volatility.”So far this year, shares of MS have lost 5.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, no evidence was found that could prove that WFC’s chief executive, Charlie Scharf, and senior diversity executives had knowledge of the sham interviews.The plaintiffs, through the class action suit, had claimed that Wells Fargo had inflated its stock price by issuing a public statement discussing its guidelines mentioning workplace diversity. The said policy was adopted in 2020 and required at least 50% of candidates, who were interviewed for jobs paying at least $100,000, to be minorities, women or people from other disadvantaged groups.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -6.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has lost 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of -10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.4%. This estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.02 indicates a change of +21.8% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $13.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.2%. The $54.55 billion and $58.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Omnicom Group How Quickly Is Omnicom Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Omnicom Group has managed to grow EPS by 18% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. It seems Omnicom Group is pretty stable, since revenue and EBIT margins are pretty flat year on year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Omnicom Group.Story continuesAre Omnicom Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$15b company like Omnicom Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$141m. This comes in at 1.0% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Omnicom Group To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Omnicom Group's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Omnicom Group's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Omnicom Group.Although Omnicom Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

It has recently witnessed a daily gain of 1.37%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -14.51%. However, fresh insights from the GF Score hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of FirstEnergy Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with FE. Click here to check it out. FE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FEFirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 3/10GF Value rank: 7/10Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned FirstEnergy Corp the GF Score of 67 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.FirstEnergy Corp Business OverviewFirstEnergy Corp, with a market cap of $18.95 billion, operates as an investor-owned holding company with 10 regulated distribution utilities across six mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. The company also owns and operates one of the nation's largest electric transmission systems. With sales of $12.89 billion and an operating margin of 16.04%, FirstEnergy Corp has established a significant presence in its industry.FirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisFirstEnergy Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.18 positions it worse than 76.05% of 430 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.Story continuesThe company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.7, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.28, which is worse than 89.38% of 452 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 6.22, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 73.8% of 439 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where FirstEnergy Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Lastly, FirstEnergy Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.FirstEnergy Corp (FE): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While FirstEnergy Corp has a strong market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.On October 3, stocks declined as concerns over rising interest rates took center stage for traders, triggering a drop in US Treasuries. Boohoo Group Plc, a fast-fashion retailer in the UK, tumbled 10% after revising its forecasts amid efforts to attract struggling shoppers by reducing prices. The Stoxx 600 index in Europe retreated 0.2% to a six-month low, while US equity futures stabilized. In Asia, Hong Kong shares led losses, with the Hang Seng Index falling up to 3.4% after a long weekend. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is approaching a correction, having dropped nearly 10% from its July peak during China's week-long holiday. Bond markets weakened following a Monday slump in Treasuries, driven by hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. Yields on five- to 30-year Treasuries surged about 10 basis points, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level since 2007. The US dollar strengthened against most G-10 currencies, reaching a year-to-date high against the yen after the Bank of Japan announced additional buying operations. Australia's dollar slipped to its lowest level since November due to bearish sentiment and elevated Treasury yields following the central bank's unchanged policy decision. The global bond sell-off intensified as the US government shutdown reprieve led traders to increase bets on a November rate hike from the Fed, now with roughly a one-in-three chance. Gold dropped to its lowest level since March, and oil fell for a fourth consecutive day, with West Texas Intermediate falling below $90 a barrel. Concerns about the second-order impacts of stronger growth and higher rates, including potential inflation resurgence, contributed to increased market volatility. China Evergrande Group, however, defied the overall negative trend, surging up to 42% upon resuming trading after a recent halt.Story continuesAccording to Reuters, a group of crypto investors is shifting focus from Bitcoin to blockchain technology, aiming to revitalize traditional assets through ""tokenization"" – the issuance of blockchain-based digital tokens representing assets like bonds, stocks, and real estate. Major financial firms, including London Stock Exchange Group, WisdomTree, and Mirae Asset Securities, have invested in or are exploring token trading and investment platforms. Institutions like Franklin Templeton, UBS Asset Management, and ABN Amro have launched tokenized versions of assets. Over a third of U.S. institutional investors and nearly two-thirds of high-net-worth investors plan to invest in tokenized assets, driven by potential savings on transaction costs. Despite challenges, some believe this time is different, citing increased senior-level buy-in from large firms. The market cap of tokenized public securities is currently $345 million, a fraction of the wider cryptocurrency market. While hurdles remain, there is optimism for broader adoption in the future, fostering a better network effect.In financial markets, notable equities such as NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) and SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) have received downgrades from analysts among many other companies. To access a comprehensive list of stocks that have recently undergone downgrades by financial analysts, kindly refer to the complete article.Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.93 (+0.46%)The Goldman Sachs Group revised its outlook on October 2 about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), indicating a shift from Conviction-Buy to Buy. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform, has been a focal point for investors seeking exposure to the rapidly evolving technology sector. The decision by Goldman Sachs to adjust its rating from Conviction-Buy to Buy suggests a nuanced evaluation of the company's performance and potential future growth. As of the latest market update, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) current share price stands at $203.73, reflecting a slight increase of 0.5% after the downgrade. This shift in valuation underscores the immediate response of investors to the altered analyst recommendation.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”09. Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.05 (-0.03%)On October 2, Piper Sandler adjusted its stance on Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), downgrading it from Overweight to Neutral while maintaining an unaltered price target of $157. The analyst believes that the anticipated takeover by Cisco Systems (CSCO) will proceed as planned, adhering to existing terms and timelines. Furthermore, the analyst deems the current price target of $157 per share as reflective of a fair valuation for the asset. Investors are encouraged to consider these insights as they navigate their investment decisions in light of potential developments in the dynamic landscape of mergers and acquisitions.Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We exited our position in Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) during the quarter. A number of developments caused us to question whether Splunk’s competitive position was eroding. Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”08. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -1.78 (-0.86%)On October 2, analyst Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan revised his stance on Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB), downgrading it from Overweight to Neutral while maintaining an unaltered price target of $250. Bhullar holds a more cautious perspective on the overall commercial lines market, citing that the stock's valuation lacks the appeal it had during the upgrade in March. The property and casualty sector faces the risk of heightened inflation, and although investor sentiment is optimistic, the analyst deems the current valuation levels as unattractive, as communicated in a research note to investors.Ave Maria World Equity Fund made the following comment about Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is the world’s largest publicly traded P&amp;C insurance company and a leading commercial lines insurer in the U.S. with operations in 54 countries and territories. Chubb is regarded as one of the most skilled property and casualty underwriters globally with an average P&amp;C combined ratio of 90.8% between 2018 and 2022.”07. Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -0.83 (-1.56%)On October 2, Goldman Sachs removed Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) from its prestigious Conviction List, while maintaining a Buy rating and retaining an optimistic $80 price target for the shares. This adjustment was implemented during the October update to the firm's America's Conviction List - Directors' Cut. The move suggests a recalibration in the level of conviction regarding Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) within Goldman Sachs, although the Buy rating and the specified price target indicate continued positive sentiment towards the stock.ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy made the following comment about Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“On an individual stock basis, positions in Broadcom, Comcast, Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI), Madison Square Garden Sports and Twitter were the leading contributors to absolute returns during the period. HVAC and building services provider Johnson Controls, meanwhile, saw a normalization of supply chain and semiconductor shortages lead to better operating results and subsequent strong performance.”06. Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI)Price Reaction after the Downgrade: -2.45 (-2.07%)On October 2, Bank of America (BofA) revised its outlook on Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI), downgrading it from Buy to Neutral and concurrently reducing the price target from $148 to $128. This adjustment is accompanied by a cut in the firm's fiscal year 2024 core Funds From Operations (FFO) per share estimate, which now stands at $7.30, down from $7.49. BofA's downgrade is grounded in uncertainties regarding the stabilization of the U.K. in terms of volume and margin, coupled with the belief that ""operational excellence is key to driving outperformance in today's macro backdrop."" While Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI) demonstrated resilience during a period of low interest rates and robust acquisition activity, the current capital market conditions suggest a shift in the strategy required to generate shareholder value. The analyst notes that Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI) operations may need to catch up with the company's substantial growth trajectory. This reassessment by BofA underscores the importance of operational efficiency in the current economic environment and suggests a divergence in the approach needed to navigate the evolving capital market landscape.Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund made the following comment about Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Fund had the opportunity to initiate a position in the common stock of Sun Communities, Inc. (NYSE:SUI) during the quarter, as its recent divergence created a rare price-to-value disconnect in Fund Management’s opinion.Founded by the Shiffman family in the mid 1970’s, Sun Communities Inc. (“Sun”) has been publicly-traded since 1993, and meaningfully expanded its platform over the past 40 years.

The last thing you want to do is buy into a company that is a sinking ship and will continue to decline. The investor will continue to abandon the company, looking for other opportunities. This has led to the emergence of materials stocks to avoid.Materials prices have seen a slight decline in overall prices following the pandemic, which saw materials prices surge, which also sent materials stocks higher. Companies within the sector are trying to find ways to remain as profitable as they were during the pandemic.The three materials stocks I mention below are, in my opinion, ones that won’t offer anything but disappointment, especially in the near term. These companies are all facing a whole host of issues, from consistently declining sales to reduced production output and leadership changes. Investors should just avoid these companies for now until a possible turnaround.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHecla Mining (HL)Mining cart in a silver, copper, and gold mine representing VOXR Stock.Source: TTstudio / ShutterstockHecla Mining (NYSE:HL) mines for materials such as gold, silver, and zinc. Headquartered in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, it has different minie locations in Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.Year-to-date, its share price has plummeted by 31%. Mainly due to a large collapse amid a fire in their mine located in Idaho, which luckily was in a portion of the mine where no one was located at the time. Hecla also announced that the mine would be shut down for the remainder of this year. This is a significant loss to Hecla’s silver production, which, from January to the end of July, the mine produced 3 million ounces of silver. It is trying to offset this significant drop in production by ramping up the output of its other mines.Story continuesOn August 8, it reported earnings results for the second quarter, which stated an increase in an overall net loss of 16%, and total revenue declined by 7% compared to the year before. This makes it one of those materials stocks to avoid.Sealed Air (SEE)green beer bottles in a factory line, ready to be sealed. represents packaging companieSource: shutterstock.com/zedspiderSealed Air (NYSE:SEE), located in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a producer of a wide range of packaging products for uses such as preserving perishable food products as well as protective packaging used in the shipping process of consumer goods.Sealed Air’s stocks have fallen by approximately 36% year-to-date due to continued financial struggles and a lower income potential forecast. On August 8, Sealed Air released its second-quarter earnings results.Net income dropped by 13%, and total sales fell by 3% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Its updated full-year outlook for 2023 stated a decrease in its expected net sales range to between $5.4-$5.6 billion, which was reduced from $5.9-$6.1 previously. Although fluctuations in a company’s earnings and top line are to be expected, when they coincide with a sharp drop in its stock price it may become one of those materials stocks to avoid.Alcoa (AA)close-up of stack of aluminum construction material from top-down angleSource: shutterstock.com/SimoneNAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a large aluminum producer located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It also mines for bauxite, a key component in producing aluminum metal. Alcoa also operates nearly 30 locations globally.Over the past year, the stock price for Alcoa has fallen by 25%. And it has retreated 70% from its all-time high at the beginning of 2022. The continual drop in total revenue and production cost of its aluminum products has led to this decline.On July 19, Alcoa released its earnings results for the second quarter of 2023. It stated a drop in total revenue of 26% compared to the year before. In Q2 2022, it reported a net income of $674 million; in Q2 2023, it became a net loss of $121 million. This was attributed to lower prices for aluminum and higher cost to produce products.Recently, Alcoa has had a number of major leadership changes, including the appointment of a new Executive Vice President, who will also be Chief Commerical Officer, and a new President and CEO, William Oplinger, which came into effect on September 24.As of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Noah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

GIII has been doing well, thanks to its robust strategies, including digital expansion and brand strength, and sound fundamentals. The company has been undertaking several strategies, including acquisitions and the licensing of well-known brands, to expand its product portfolio. Management is optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio of key brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston.Buoyed by such endeavors, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged a whopping 80.9% year to date. Meanwhile, the industry fell 6.6% in this year so far.Let’s Delve DeeperG-III Apparel’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via the ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding its global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory.We note that the company has numerous growth opportunities including the repositioning and expansion of the Donna Karan label and a long-term license for the Nautica brand. G-III Apparel will produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. First deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall. Management has announced a new multi-year license agreement with HanesBrands to manufacture an outerwear collection for the Champion brand. The company will create quality heritage pieces to expand Champions' lifestyle offering. The product will be distributed via its diverse channels across North America and Champions' global network with the first deliveries scheduled for fall of 2024.With respect to the company’s brand progress, the key brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston are likely to perform well. Expanding the company’s owned brands, which include DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin, is a priority as these brands represent an important long-term profit. Also, these brands enable the company to further widen its global reach. In fiscal 2024, with the ownership of the whole Karl Lagerfeld brand, the company’s international sales will be up 20% versus the prior year. Management believes this business can expand to more than $3 billion in annual revenues over time.Story continuesWhat’s More?G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and improved year over year. For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales to be about $3.30 billion and net income to be $145-$150 million, or between $3.05 per share and $3.15 per share. This compares favorably to net sales of $3.23 billion and a net loss of $(133.1) million, or $(2.79) per share, for fiscal 2023. It expects continued gross margin improvement for the rest of the fiscal year, and projects ending the year with the gross margin up nearly 450 bps year over year. The second half of fiscal 2024’s gross margin will benefit from moderated freight costs.Analysts seem optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.30 billion and $3.27, respectively. These estimates show corresponding increases of 8% and 14.7% year over year. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 sales and EPS currently stands at $3.37 billion and $3.41, respectively, reflecting corresponding increases of 1.9% and 4.5% year over year.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses. A VGM Score of A further speaks volumes for the company.Eye These Solid Picks TooSome other top-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank of 1, at present.

But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. For example, after five long years the PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) share price is a whole 68% lower. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 14% in the last 90 days.Since PG&amp;E has shed US$2.5b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. See our latest analysis for PG&amp;E While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, PG&amp;E moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPG&amp;E is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.A Different PerspectivePG&amp;E provided a TSR of 8.0% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 11% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  PG&amp;E is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are concerning...Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

NWSA, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corp. IMAX.Industry: EntertainmentLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2159035/4-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-entertainment-industryThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is benefiting from a spike in demand for digital entertainment, fueled by limited capacity and operational limitations in movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Warner Music Group, News Corp., Lions Gate Entertainment and IMAX Corp.Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations.Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies, among others, is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels, such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television, is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #79, which places it in the top 32% of more than 246 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats S&amp;P 500, SectorThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 and its own sector in the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 19.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s return of 13.5% and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s increase of 10.2% over the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Film and Television Production and Distribution stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.65X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.67X and the sector’s 1.75X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.49X and as low as 0.92X, recording a median of 1.52X.4 Film &amp; Television Stocks to Watch Right NowIMAX: IMAX has been riding on the impressive performance of blockbuster titles so far in 2023.

Moreover, a steady cash balance and flexible business model position it well to expand and increase market share. The company expects to record $1.1 billion in the global box office for 2023 with 110-130 system installations worldwide.Last month, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company presented its next-generation streaming technology, Stream Smart, as part of its global technology platform strategy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 company’s fiscal 2024 earnings has remained steady at 73 cents per share over the past 30 days.Lions Gate Holdings: The company is benefiting from a strong pipeline of content on Starz’s platforms that boosts viewership and increases the subscriber base of its OTT platforms. Management has been planning to spend cautiously on content and not chase subscribers, therefore focusing on profitability. It would now also look for bundling and packaging opportunities.Lions Gate has delayed plans to split from Starz until early in 2024. This will help the two core businesses pursue separate strategic and financial paths, ensuring better results. Starz would focus on the United States, U.K. and Canada, exiting Latin America before the end of the year.In August, Lionsgate acquired Entertainment One’s (eOne) TV and film operations from Hasbro for over $500 million.

Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Warner Music Group WMG, News Corporation NWSA, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corporation IMAX. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations. Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies, among others, is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels, such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television, is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Per the deal, CommScope will gain a 25% stake in Vantiva. In addition, CommScope will have an opportunity to earn a maximum cumulative amount of $100 million in cash, contingent upon Vantiva achieving an EBITDA equal to or exceeding €400 million in a given fiscal year over the five years following the first full year after closing.Post-acquisition, CommScope’s Home Networks will form an integral part of Vantiva’s Connected Home division. Notably, CommScope’s Home Networks and Vantiva’s Connected Home generated $1.5 billion and €2 billion in sales, respectively, in the 12 months ended June 2023.

62,bb13c748-3c73-37d6-aa38-1243bc45aecc,MSFT,2023-10-04,20 Most Searched Stocks on Google,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-searched-stocks-google-024900566.html,1696387740,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'ADBE', 'MSFT', 'BABA', 'META', 'AMD', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'SOFI', 'NFLX', 'GME', 'NIO']","[In this article, we’ll take a look at the 20 Most Searched Stocks on Google, with a detailed overview of stock search trends. To skip the detailed analysis and have a quick overview of the top 5, read our article 5 Most Searched Stocks on Google.A Gallup survey highlights the growing public engagement with stocks, showcasing that around 61% of Americans own stock. This data underlines a broader trend in the stock market, and Google searches serve as the pulse of this expanding investor base.Giants in the stock market like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) commonly dominate search engines like Google while also boasting market capitalization in hundreds of billions of dollars. Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, boasts an average monthly search volume of 2.74 million on Google.  At the same time, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) current market cap stands at around $2.73 trillion. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another example of the most searched stocks on Google. With an average monthly search volume of 9.14 million and a current market cap of $767.32 billion, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shows the influence of tech giants not only in search results but in the global economic landscape as well.Global events also widely influence stock searches on Google. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped market dynamics. With travel restrictions and lockdowns in place, airline and travel stocks plummeted in interest and value, while pharmaceuticals and tech companies boomed.Biotech firms involved in vaccine development like Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer Inc saw a significant appreciation in value during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) stock, previously a lesser-known entity for the general public, saw an increase in average monthly search volume from effectively zero in December 2019 to 5.5 million in December 2020. Likewise, the search interest of the Pfizer stock in Google trends grew from practically zero in December 2019 to 100% in December 2020.Story continuesStocks that are most frequently searched on Google often tend to be the ones most actively traded as well. For example, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is one of the most traded stocks with the average daily trading volume of around 58.36 million shares. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also one of the most traded stocks, with an average daily trading volume of around 118 million shares.Most searched stocks often top the list of best performing stocks as well. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), for instance, is considered one of the best-performing stocks in the past 25 years, and it has generated an aggregate return of over  170,000% since its IPO in 1997.However, a rise in search volume doesn't necessarily equate to stock profitability or viability. Often, companies making headlines due to controversies or legal issues also see an uptick in searches.For instance, when a company faces allegations of malpractice, its stock might become one of the most searched, not because of increased investor interest but out of sheer public curiosity and concern. For instance, during Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s announcement of its 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, searches for ""Tesla stock"" spiked significantly.The negative press also drives search volumes. Boeing experienced this firsthand in 2019 when its 737 MAX faced global scrutiny following two fatal crashes. Google search queries for ""Boeing stock"" spiked by 690% from February 2019 to March 2019, reflecting public concern.Meme stocks have also been gaining attention in Google search results. For example, AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) have a search volume of millions, placing them on the list of most searched stocks on Google. The search momentum was primarily driven by retail investors' subbreddit -- r/Wallstreetbets.For investors and market analysts, understanding these Google search trends is becoming an increasingly essential tool. However, it should be combined with robust fundamental and technical analysis to derive actionable investment insights. The most searched stocks present a snapshot, but the true investment landscape requires a broader view.20 Most Searched Stocks on GoogleSource: pexelsMethodologyTo figure out which stocks are most searched on Google, we first turned to tools like Google Keyword Planner and keywordtool.io. By entering terms like 'stock' and 'stocks', these tools gave us a list of the most searched stocks on Google. From this list, we selected the top 80 stocks. Now, to understand how often each of these stocks is searched every month, we used another tool called Keywords Everywhere. This tool provided us with the average monthly search volume for each stock. Finally, we arranged these stocks in order, from the most searched to the least, based on the numbers from Keywords Everywhere. From this organized list, we took the top 20. These are the stocks that we found to be the most popular and frequently searched on Google.Below is our list of the top 20 most searched stocks on Google, arranged in descending order from 20 (least searched on our list) to 1 (most searched).Note: Even though our article is primarily on stocks, we've also included ETFs that have had a significant Google search interest and volume.20 Most Searched Stocks on Google20. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)Average monthly search volume: 673,000Though The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares have been a popular choice among investors due to the company’s vast portfolio of intellectual properties, its stock has seen a consistent fall in recent years.19. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Average monthly search volume: 823,000Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)’s stock performance reflects its dominance in the e-commerce space within China and its expanding global reach. However, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)’s stock has observed fluctuations in recent years due to regulatory challenges, COVID-19 lockdowns, and market competition.In Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Daniel Zhang – executive chairman and chief executive officer of Alibaba Group Holding Limited – expressed:Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, AIDC, delivered 41% overall revenue growth this quarter, and its retail business achieved 60% revenue growth year-over-year. This was driven by solid order growth of our international retail parking places at around 25% year-over-year growth. Advertising revenue growth because of the enhancement of our monetization and higher direct sales revenue contribution as AliExpress expands its new choice model. Alibaba also delivered a record order growth based on its defeated country strategy, accelerating progress in high-priority markets such as Philippines and Thailand. In Turkey, Trendyol continued to maintain its growth momentum and market leadership.18. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Average monthly search volume: 823,000Rivian Automative, Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) at a price of $78 per share was one of the most anticipated in the electric vehicle industry.

Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesMicrosoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella testified in a federal court in Washington, D.C. yesterday (Oct. 2) that Google (GOOGL)’s total dominance in the online search business makes it difficult for competitors, even his company, to gain market share. Nadella’s testimony raised an important question: If Microsoft can’t challenge Google, who can?Nadella was called as a witness in the Department of Justice’s antitrust trial against Alphabet (GOOGL)’s Google. The government alleged that Google squashed competition in online search with its web of exclusionary business agreements—such as paying smartphone makers and web browser companies to set Google as their default search engine. The DOJ filed its case against Google in 2020, and the trial is expected to last into November.Read Also: Where Do Google and Microsoft Stand in A.I. Race? CEOs Dish On Earnings CallsMicrosoft is Google’s primary rival in online search, but Microsoft’s Bing poses little threat to Google, which claims more than 90 percent of the online search market, according to SimilarWeb data. Bing owns only a little more than 3 percent and other players, such as Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, share the rest of the search market.Nadella said in court Microsoft had plans to spend billions of dollars to build a partnership with Apple (AAPL) to make Bing the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.Nadella said he had “focused every year of my tenure as CEO” since 2014 “to see if Apple would be open” to signing a deal with Microsoft and the two companies had had “a series of dialogues on it.”“It’s a hard game to make any breakthroughs, but no one can accuse us of not being persistent,” Nadella said. Microsoft introduced Bing in 2009. Nadella estimated the company has invested about $100 billion in Bing over the past two decades.For now, Google is Apple’s exclusive search engine provider. Google reportedly pays Apple billions of dollars every year for making Google the default search engine on all of its devices. This year, Google could pay Apple as much as $19 billion, according to an estimate by asset manager Bernstein.Story continuesIn court, Nadella called the agreement between Apple and Google “oligopolistic.”Google’s search engine is also ubiquitous in Android phones, which are preloaded with a host of Google applications that can’t be deleted.Google has argued that it’s easy for smartphone users to change to a different search engine on the web browser. Nadella refuted the argument as “completely bogus.”“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” he said. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.”This year, Google and Microsoft have been locked in a race to integrate artificial intelligence into their search engines. Microsoft, an investor in OpenAI, launched a new version of Bing enhanced by OpenAI’s GPT language models. Google has introduced an in-house chatbot called Bard, but hasn’t incorporated it in Google Search yet.“Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I’m trapped in could get even more vicious,” Nadella said.Trending Observer StoriesBillionaire Philanthropists Have Discovered a New Way to Give Away Their FortunesSpaceX to Launch Starship's Second Orbital Test This Weekend: What to KnowThe Most Influential People in the Art World TodayThe Best New Whiskeys of the SeasonReview: Barry Manilow Writes the Songs That Make 'Harmony' SingRead the original story Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: Google's Deal With Apple Is 'Oligopolistic' and others by Sissi Cao at Observer.]"

WBA is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Oct 12, before market open.In the fiscal third quarter, the company missed earnings estimates by 5.7%. WBA’s earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 0.81%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens is likely to have gained from successful executions of growth strategies on the United States and the international fronts. The firm returned an incremental 300 stores to regular pharmacy operating hours during the fiscal third quarter through its focused investments. The company is witnessing improved market share trends with a 6% growth in stores within normal hours. The company opened its ninth automated micro fulfillment center, supporting about 3,900 total stores. This is likely to have benefited the company’s top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.In August 2023, Walgreens Boots Alliance and VillageMD opened the first Village Medical at Walgreens primary care practice in Chicago. Village MD’s physicians and Walgreens’ pharmacy team members collaborate to provide patients with cost-effective, expert care for chronic conditions, general illnesses and injuries. These strategic pacts are likely to have positively contributed to the company’s fiscal third-quarter performance, thus adding to the top line.However, the decline in COVID testing volumes, rapid softening of the macro environment, higher inflation and interest rates, lower tax refunds and an uncertain economic outlook are likely to have impeded Walgreen's revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.United StatesWalgreens is likely to have registered growth in the U.S. retail pharmacy business as script volume is likely to have gained traction through the months of the fiscal fourth quarter.In August 2023, Walgreens announced the offering of in-store vouchers and off-site vaccination clinics through its employer vaccination program and is rolling out a low-cost, 2 results in 1 test for flu and COVID-19 this fall respiratory virus season. The same month, Walgreens launched Over-the-counter (OTC) NARCAN Nasal Spray, which will be available at Walgreens stores and online, with nationwide availability. We believe this launch to have contributed strongly to the top line.Story continuesIn the United States, Walgreens’ retail business witnessed impressive momentum through digital and omnichannel growth from the myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and other profit streams. During the fiscal third quarter, the company’s retail gross margin performance remained strong, reflecting effective margin management, including strategic pricing, promotional optimization and improved shrink. The company is progressing on building its next growth engine in healthcare, rapidly establishing the portfolio of assets across the care continuum. These developments are likely to have contributed to Walgreens’ fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.Our estimate suggests Walgreens’ U.S. Healthcare business to register an increase of 176.1% in Q4.InternationalIn recent times, the international business of WBA is registering an ongoing rebound and strong execution across its retail portfolio, particularly in Boots U.K. and growth in the German wholesale business. The company is expected to have registered strong growth in the fiscal fourth quarter again, banking on continued positive trends globally.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote During the fiscal third quarter, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield signed on as the fourth payor partner for Walgreens Health. Shields and CareCentrix recently contracted with a leading national health solution and care delivery organization. Shields also added six new health system partners this year. Walgreens Boots partnered with TelePharm to expand tele-pharmacy services, improve access to care and provide flexibility for how and when patients engage with pharmacists. This development is expected to have boosted the company’s revenues in the quarter to be reported.Per our estimates, the Walgreens International business will likely register an increase of 9.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter.EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $34.55 billion. The projection indicates a 6.5% rise from the prior-year comparable quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 69 cents, suggesting a 13.8% fall year on year.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Walgreens this time around.

For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.64 per share, while it actually produced $0.74 per share, a surprise of 15.63%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Starbucks. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Starbucks currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.77%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NASDAQ:XEL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 7.5% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 13% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Xcel Energy, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Xcel Energy. See our latest analysis for Xcel Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Xcel Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Xcel Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Xcel Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Xcel Energy. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 5.4% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Xcel EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Xcel Energy Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$26m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Xcel Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Xcel Energy (at least 1 which is potentially serious)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 79% in that time.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Monster Beverage managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Monster Beverage has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 12% per year. Although the share price growth has slowed, the longer term story points to a business well worth watching. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

You can skip our detailed analysis and directly proceed to the 5 Most Competitive Residency Programs in the US.A multitude of medical school graduates compete for a limited number of coveted spots each year, within the prestigious residency programs of the United States. The competition is nothing short of intense, evidenced by the exponential surge in applications, the elevated level of difficulty, and the strikingly low acceptance rates.According to data released by the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) on June 1st 2022, there exist certain residency programs that stand out due to their stringent training regimens and stellar reputation. These programs have garnered a notorious reputation for their complexity when it comes to gaining admission.For fresh medical school graduates, these residency programs hold the promise of providing invaluable firsthand clinical experience, paving the way for a promising and luminous future in their respective medical specialties. Those fortunate enough to secure a position within these programs invariably represent the pinnacle of the medical industry, possessing exceptional qualities of resilience, unwavering dedication, and advanced clinical expertise.The Growth and Impact of Residency Programs in the United StatesStats from NRMP released on June 1, 2022, show that the Main Residency Match in 2022 witnessed a total of 47,675 registrants, which was 1,025 fewer than the preceding year, marking the first decline in registrant numbers since 2003. Among these participants, there were 42,549 active applicants.According to a Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) release, published on October 10, 2022, the academic year 2021-2022 witnessed a total of 12,740 accredited programs. Among these, 5,579 were categorized as specialty programs, while 7,161 fell under the subspecialty category. Moreover, 384 programs obtained accreditation status during this academic year. On the other hand, 42 programs either closed or voluntarily withdrew their accreditation, with 14 of them experiencing actions such as Accreditation Withdrawn or Administrative Withdrawal.Story continuesIn terms of residents and fellows, there were 153,843 individuals actively enrolled in the 12,740 programs. This represented an increase of 4,643 compared to the previous year. Among these 153,843 active residents and fellows in ACGME-accredited programs during the Academic Year 2021-2022, the majority, accounting for 59.6%, hailed from Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited medical schools in the United States. International medical school graduates constituted 22.9% of the total, while 17.4% were graduates of osteopathic medical schools.Competitive residency programs in the US also offer unbeatable opportunities for networking and career development. Due to the extensive range of collaborations they entail, trainees have the advantage of forging professional relationships with mentors, peers, and leading experts in research and practice.An additional key element driving competition is the ever-growing demand for qualified medical professionals in the United States. As the population continues to increase and age, there is an insatiable need for more physicians, resulting in an amplified supply-demand disparity.A report by Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), published on June 11, 2021, predicted a physician shortage in the United States, ranging from 37,800 to 124,000 by 2034. Such projections amplify the ambition of medical students, as they strive to secure coveted spots in competitive residency programs, highlighting the growing importance of securing a position on the path to becoming a physician.Physicians can work with some of the top healthcare facilities and services providers including HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA), Pediatrix Medical Group (NYSE:MD), and Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED). Let's discuss some business updates regarding these organizations.On August 3, Pediatrix Medical Group (NYSE:MD) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.39 and generated a revenue of $500.58 million for the quarter, up 2.99% year over year and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $4.73 million.On September 27, Boston Globe reported that HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) entered a preliminary phase for a possible union with the Catholic Medical Center (CMC) through an exploratory non-binding letter of intent. This action will be followed by further due diligence, negotiations of the final terms, and procuring the required consents. The merger will further the cause of both HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) and CMC in the region.As reported by Reuters on June 5, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) has made an offer to buy Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED). UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), through its Optum unit, offered a $3.26 billion all-cash bid to acquire home health and hospice care firm Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED), placing itself in direct competition with Option Care Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPCH), which had previously agreed to buy Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED) for $97.38 per share in an all-stock transaction. This move comes amid a surge in interest for the home health sector since the pandemic, as patients and caregivers increasingly prefer at-home medical services, prioritizing safety.Students who pass through competitive residency programs can eventually work in the best hospitals in the United States. For greater insights regarding the same, view our article on the 25 Best Hospitals in the U.S.Understanding PGY-1 and PGY-2 PositionsResidency programs in the United States typically follow a ""PGY"" system or ""Post-Graduate Year."" These numbers, PGY-1, PGY-2, and so forth, indicate the progression of a resident's training within their chosen medical specialty.The PGY-1 year, also known as the ""internship"" or ""first-year residency,"" is the first year of a doctor's specialized training after graduating from medical school. During that year, residents receive  broad clinical experience in various medical disciplines, including internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, emergency medicine, and others pertinent to their chosen specialty.PGY-1 residents, under the supervision of higher-level residents and attending physicians, begin to take on clinical responsibilities. They examine patients, make diagnoses, develop and execute treatment plans, perform basic medical procedures, and engage in direct patient care.PGY-2, or the ""second-year residency,"" takes the foundational clinical skills gained during the PGY-1 year and advances them further. The PGY-2 year often involves increased clinical responsibility, more advanced procedures, and in-depth exploration of the resident's chosen specialty.Some programs have their first official year labeled as ""PGY-2"", which is common in specialties that require a preliminary clinical year in another field, such as internal medicine. Physicians at this stage are termed PGY-2 residents, regardless of whether it is their second official year of residency. For example, in radiation oncology and dermatology, the official residency program starts at the PGY-2 level.Our list of the most competitive residency programs in the US will discuss PGY-1 and PGY-2 openings across residency programs in the United States.15 Most Competitive Residency Programs in USuzhursky/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo identify the most competitive residency programs in the United States, we utilized data from the National Residency Matching Program and their corresponding list of Average USMLE Step 2 CK scores accepted by the different programs.We conducted an additional assessment to check the number of applicants for the program and the number of corresponding PGY-1 and PGY-2 positions. Some residencies offer both PGY-1 and PGY-2 positions for a specific Match year, while others just offer either PGY-1 or PGY-2 positions. The data, when connected with the most recent average USMLE Step 2 CK scores released in July 2022, helped us compile the list in ascending order.

The bank now expects mortgage rates to rise to 7.1% by the end of 2023. That's up from its previous estimate of 6.6%. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero discusses the forecast and why Goldman Sachs made the change.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, holding off on buying a home until rates head down? Well, you might have a long wait ahead of you. That's according to Goldman Sachs, the firm revising its mortgage rate forecast higher for the end of 2023 and 2024.With more, here's Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero. Dani, we're hoping for some good news here. and we don't seem to be getting it.DANI ROMERO: Not at all. Not one bit, Rachelle. Goldman Sachs housing economists no longer think that mortgage rates will fall this year. Instead, they will stay running high. The bank revised their forecast, saying that mortgage rates will end the year at 7.1%. And next year, mortgage rates are forecasted to end at 6.8%. And this comes as the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has hovered over 7% right now.And fixed rates also are tied to the 10-year Treasury yield, and which today has swung to the highest level since 2007. The sell-off in bonds really got fresh momentum today as investors digested an unexpected rise in job openings in August. And so the recent momentums in the bond market has caused Wall Street strategists to revise their forecasts for this year and next year, which raises the risks for mortgage rates overall.And for home buyers, purchasing power has diminished. It has fallen through the cracks as higher rates, high home prices, low inventory has squeezed affordability for these homebuyers. And lending activity has also fallen.Goldman Sachs expects this trend to continue throughout the end of the year and next year, the reason why they are forecasting their call for mortgage originations to hit next year about $1.35 trillion for next year. So definitely a major cut there, Rachelle.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. And of course, Dani, with house prices soaring, then how are smaller, less expensive homes faring?DANI ROMERO: A smaller home is the way to go. Goldman Sachs says that smaller and lower-priced homes have had such strong home price appreciation compared to higher and more expensive homes. For example, Miami saw this trend really grow with some strong gains. Low-priced homes saw a 5.6% gain in home price appreciation over the past 12 months, while high home prices in Miami only saw a 0.3% gain.The reason, it's become a natural adaptation for home buyers to actually pick a smaller home. And the reason, especially for first-time home buyers that are challenged by the affordability issue, that has become their preference. But, Rachelle, this is a trend that is going to stay strong.We're not saying sayonara to smaller homes. Data from the Census Bureau shows that the average square footage of a new home stood at 2,415 square feet in the second quarter of this year. That is only 49 square feet lower than the previous quarter. So this is something we're going to see a long trend about.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Perhaps the way for people to get their foot in the door as it were with the housing market, at least until things pick up and affordability gets a little bit better. Appreciate that update. Our very own Dani Romero.]"

102,542f03fb-a39e-3c9e-8bb9-dd5bfc471fc4,SLB,2023-10-04,Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limiteds-nyse-slb-stocks-110142235.html,1696417302,STORY,['SLB'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) stock increased significantly by 19% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Schlumberger's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:21% = US$4.0b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.21 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Schlumberger seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Schlumberger's significant 31% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Schlumberger's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SLB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SLB is currently mispriced by the market.Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Schlumberger has a three-year median payout ratio of 28% (where it is retaining 72% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that Schlumberger is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Schlumberger has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 35% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Schlumberger's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

(Photo: Business Wire)SLB’s End-to-end Emissions Solutions (SEES) business today introduced its next generation methane point instrument, a self-installed continuous methane monitoring system that uses IoT-enabled sensors to quickly and cost effectively detect, locate and quantify emissions across oil and gas operations. Effective monitoring is essential to reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas (GHG) which has a climate change impact up to 84 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timescale and represents about half of the oil and gas sector’s operational emissions.The methane point instrument represents a step change in methane measurement technology, providing operators with industry-leading leak detection sensitivity in a small, durable, first-of-its kind ‘plug-and-play’ solution. The technology automates continuous methane monitoring—eliminating the need for manual data collection during typical intermittent site visits, which only offers producers a small sample of their emissions.""Designed for ‘always on’, accurate measurement and fast, affordable deployment at any scale, our next generation point instrument widens the accessibility to continuous methane monitoring for the industry, providing producers with a practical pathway to achieve a more complete picture of their emissions profile,"" said Kahina Abdeli-Galinier, emissions business director, SLB. ""Having this level of insight, with a new level of deployability, is becoming increasingly important for producers as pressure mounts from regulators and the public across the globe to address the near-term warming effects of climate change caused by methane.""Story continuesLight and portable, the compact device contains an integrated solar panel, wind measurement and methane sensor. The instrument can be self-installed in minutes, mounted on existing infrastructure and deployed at virtually zero cost—much like a self-installed home security camera. It enables operators to more economically scale up and quickly roll out continuous methane monitoring across their facilities.The methane point instrument supports the reporting requirements of the Oil &amp; Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, or OGMP—the flagship reporting and mitigation program of the United Nations Environment Programme. It also supports related reporting requirements in the EU and is aligned to satisfy the proposed US EPA rules for methane monitoring at active onshore US production facilities.Today’s announcement was made as part of ADIPEC, an international platform uniting industry to accelerate urgent, collective and responsible action to decarbonize quicker and future-proof our energy system, taking place in Abu Dhabi through October 5.SEES was launched in March 2022 and offers a comprehensive set of services and cutting-edge technologies designed to give operators a robust and scalable solution for measuring, monitoring, reporting and, ultimately, eliminating methane and routine flare emissions. Since its launch, SEES has undertaken customer projects worldwide, deploying its portfolio of capabilities, including consulting, optimized surveillance planning, measurements, and interpretation via a secure digital platform.About SLBSLB (NYSE: SLB) is a global technology company that drives energy innovation for a balanced planet.

""Ensuring that a storage site is both safer and economical is crucial for the speed, scale and investment needed to meaningfully drive CCUS growth for a low carbon energy ecosystem.""The screening and ranking solution uses both technical and nontechnical data to provide a detailed assessment of the capacity and economic viability of storage sites, while identifying potential risks. A benchmark comparison, pulling from successful storage projects globally, is created to provide a relative basis for ranking each site.SLB uses proprietary tools, augmented by advanced digitally enabled workflows, to provide a fast, traceable and consistent process to validate the data, with an emphasis on risk identification using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.In Trinidad and Tobago, SLB collaborated with a customer to screen and rank potential storage sites, ahead of a scheduled offshore exploration and production and carbon storage licensing round. SLB evaluated storage sites in three geographic provinces, using 67 key criteria from SLB's proprietary workflow to evaluate potential sites. It then performed a sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of varied attributes and site properties on the ranking outcomes. The sites’ performance was benchmarked against the attributes of carbon storage basins in the United States and Europe.Story continuesUsing Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate more than 2,000 iterations, SLB ranked the sites for the customer from best to worst. The process empowered the customer to prioritize areas with prime subsurface and surface characteristics, as well as high grading zones for more detailed evaluation and investment.Today’s announcement was made as part of ADIPEC, an international platform uniting industry to accelerate urgent, collective and responsible action to decarbonize quicker and future-proof our energy system, taking place in Abu Dhabi through October 5.For more information about the carbon storage and ranking solution, visit slb.com/carbon-storage-screening-ranking.About SLBSLB (NYSE: SLB) is a global technology company that drives energy innovation for a balanced planet.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.American International Group in FocusBased in New York, American International Group (AIG) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -5.04%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.36 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.4%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 2.28%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.73%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 12.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, American International Group has increased its dividend 1 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 1.28%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, American International Group's payout ratio is 27%, which means it paid out 27% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AIG expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.73 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 47.91%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AIG is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the detailed analysis and have a quick overview of the top 5, read our article 5 Most Searched Stocks on Google.A Gallup survey highlights the growing public engagement with stocks, showcasing that around 61% of Americans own stock. This data underlines a broader trend in the stock market, and Google searches serve as the pulse of this expanding investor base.Giants in the stock market like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) commonly dominate search engines like Google while also boasting market capitalization in hundreds of billions of dollars. Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, boasts an average monthly search volume of 2.74 million on Google.  At the same time, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) current market cap stands at around $2.73 trillion. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another example of the most searched stocks on Google. With an average monthly search volume of 9.14 million and a current market cap of $767.32 billion, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shows the influence of tech giants not only in search results but in the global economic landscape as well.Global events also widely influence stock searches on Google. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped market dynamics. With travel restrictions and lockdowns in place, airline and travel stocks plummeted in interest and value, while pharmaceuticals and tech companies boomed.Biotech firms involved in vaccine development like Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer Inc saw a significant appreciation in value during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) stock, previously a lesser-known entity for the general public, saw an increase in average monthly search volume from effectively zero in December 2019 to 5.5 million in December 2020. Likewise, the search interest of the Pfizer stock in Google trends grew from practically zero in December 2019 to 100% in December 2020.Story continuesStocks that are most frequently searched on Google often tend to be the ones most actively traded as well. For example, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is one of the most traded stocks with the average daily trading volume of around 58.36 million shares. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also one of the most traded stocks, with an average daily trading volume of around 118 million shares.Most searched stocks often top the list of best performing stocks as well. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), for instance, is considered one of the best-performing stocks in the past 25 years, and it has generated an aggregate return of over  170,000% since its IPO in 1997.However, a rise in search volume doesn't necessarily equate to stock profitability or viability. Often, companies making headlines due to controversies or legal issues also see an uptick in searches.For instance, when a company faces allegations of malpractice, its stock might become one of the most searched, not because of increased investor interest but out of sheer public curiosity and concern. For instance, during Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s announcement of its 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020, searches for ""Tesla stock"" spiked significantly.The negative press also drives search volumes. Boeing experienced this firsthand in 2019 when its 737 MAX faced global scrutiny following two fatal crashes. Google search queries for ""Boeing stock"" spiked by 690% from February 2019 to March 2019, reflecting public concern.Meme stocks have also been gaining attention in Google search results. For example, AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) have a search volume of millions, placing them on the list of most searched stocks on Google. The search momentum was primarily driven by retail investors' subbreddit -- r/Wallstreetbets.For investors and market analysts, understanding these Google search trends is becoming an increasingly essential tool. However, it should be combined with robust fundamental and technical analysis to derive actionable investment insights. The most searched stocks present a snapshot, but the true investment landscape requires a broader view.20 Most Searched Stocks on GoogleSource: pexelsMethodologyTo figure out which stocks are most searched on Google, we first turned to tools like Google Keyword Planner and keywordtool.io.

112,3c18a2a1-dee7-3f68-92a7-82ba1216a51f,NFLX,2023-10-04,Why Netflix is reportedly looking to raise prices for ad-free tier,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-netflix-reportedly-looking-raise-212729609.html,1696368449,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'DIS', 'WBD']","[Netflix (NFLX) is considering raising the price of its ad-free plan after the SAG-AFTRA strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other streamers such as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS), have raised the prices of their ad-free tiers. Third Bridge Analyst Jamie Lumley joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest on Netflix and where the price hikes could start.“On the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive,” Lumley says. As Netflix thinks “about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position, price hikes is one way to really do that.”Lumley notes that streamers are finding increased value “in driving people to the ad-supported tiers.” Ad-supported plans for a lot of streamers have not increased in price so “by raising the price on the ad-free, they’re hoping they can drive further traffic there,” Lumley states.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Another company that we're watching today in a story we're following is Netflix, reportedly eyeing further price hikes for its ad-free platform following the conclusion of the actor's strike, whenever that happens. According to the Wall Street Journal, the streamer is discussing hikes in several markets globally, but will likely begin with the United States and Canada.With more on this is James Lumley, sector analyst at Third Bridge Group. Obviously, Jamie, we don't know when the strike is going to end. But what kind of pricing power do you think Netflix has?JAMES LUMLEY: It's a great question. And thanks for having me on today. As we look at the news today regarding whether or not Netflix will be raising these prices at the conclusion of the actors' strike, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. One, if we just first look at as the why that they're doing this, on the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive as Netflix really thinks about their balance sheet, they think about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position. Price hikes is one way to really do that.Story continuesAnother thing is just also something we've been hearing from our experts for a while now and is the increasing value in driving people to the ad-supported tiers. Most of the ad-supported tiers for Netflix and competitors alike have not seen prices be shifted in the last year or so. So by raising the price on the ad-free, they're hoping they can drive further traffic there as basically the underlying economics are increasingly attractive on the ad tier.When it comes to pricing pressure, we know certainly Netflix is often viewed as one of the leader in this industry, the early mover, the only profitable streaming company. So what they can command on pricing is definitely an interesting question. By and large, they are viewed as one of the key platforms by consumers to keep when they're looking through which platforms are worth their time, which ones are seeing high engagement, but necessarily how much that will translate in their ability to raise prices from where they are now remains to be seen.- And Jamie, let's say they roll this out, they raise prices. Where do you think they would do that, Jamie? What geographies? I mean, do you think that would be US? Do you think it would be Europe? Do you think it'd be both?JAMES LUMLEY: It's a good question. If we look at where they might do this, it might be good to draw some parallels to where they first experimented with the rollout of password sharing or the crackdown on password sharing because what we've heard from our experts is Netflix is incredibly deliberate when it rolls out something new, it tries to put in changes, to make sure that this doesn't have any negative impacts on its most important markets. For the password sharing, they initially had a crackdown in South America, then in Canada, before being rolled out in the US and other major markets.But for this, on the flip side, if this is an effective way, does not drive increased churn from Netflix, rolling it out in some of those larger markets will have the largest impact, as Netflix looks to either further strengthen its positioning with increased content costs or just to really see the most traffic driven to the ad-supported tier. They could very well try that in some of the larger markets like the US or Europe.]"

115,a7d93478-2042-34a1-bd16-771724b31375,PSX,2023-10-04,5 Energy Stocks That Crushed the S&P 500 in a Bleak Q3,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-energy-stocks-crushed-p-134300363.html,1696340580,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'VLO', 'PSX', 'HAL', 'MPC']","[The third quarter of 2023 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 4% in what was brought about by a severe setback consecutively in August and September.Market participants expressed significant worry as the Fed warned of an additional 25 basis point rate hike before the year-end, indicating a prolonged period of higher interest rates to fight the stubborn inflation. Consequently, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s first quarterly loss of 2023, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with oil prices within spitting distance of the $100-a-barrel threshold and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the July-September period. The standout performers of the third quarter were Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Halliburton HAL, Valero Energy VLO and APA Corporation APA.Energy Stands Tall Amid Broad-Based DeclineAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the quarter in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while most others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index generated a total return of 11.3% in the third quarter against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 3.7%.Much of this can be attributed to Saudi Arabia's June declaration of a unilateral reduction in oil output by 1 million barrels per day. This production cut, initially extended through August and September and subsequently continued for the rest of 2023, has served as the primary driver of the increase in oil prices.In addition to Riyadh's efforts, recent data from the Energy Information Administration revealed a significant decrease in U.S. commercial crude inventories. Since July, these inventories have fallen by almost 42 million barrels. To put that in context, total domestic stock now stands at 416.3 million barrels — 3.3% less than the year-ago figure and 4% less than the five-year average.Furthermore, supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) have now dropped to 22 million barrels — the lowest since July 2022.In response, WTI oil prices topped $95 last week for its highest intraday level since August of last year. While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have more than offset the tightening supply outlook.Most energy investors have had something to cheer about in the September quarter, but some stocks certainly performed better than others. The five largest contributors to the quarterly sectoral gains were Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Halliburton, Valero Energy and APA Corporation.Will these winners maintain their run in the last quarter of 2023, too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to a lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC handily outperformed all but one stock and was up 29.8% during the period, ranking second on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Marathon continues to generate strong cash flows amid a disciplined capital strategy and increasing shareholder returns, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) downstream operator’s further price gains could be limited by operational issues and an unpredictable refining macro backdrop.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Phillips 66: Another major refiner in terms of size, efficiency and strength, Phillips 66 buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Phillips 66, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 26% last quarter. With its vast pipeline network, the company is also a big player in the midstream business, generating stable fee-based revenues. Higher commodity prices have driven upstream investments, thereby increasing volumes for midstream operators. However, due to lower demand for refined petroleum products, the firm might miss the potential gain in refining margins. Thus, Phillips 66 is likely to witness a decrease in its total capacity utilizations. Hence, we expect pre-tax income from refining business to be lower this year.Halliburton: It is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors. Halliburton operates in over 80 countries. Founded in 1919, Halliburton employs more than 40,000 people and operates under two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 22.8% in the past quarter. But it will be a bumpy ride in the near-to-medium term. While the company’s significant global presence exposes it to worldwide geopolitical risks, the rapidly rising labor and material costs are cutting margins. Finally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) energy company’s above-average debt-to-capitalization and low dividend yield are other negatives in the HAL story.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 20.8% higher in the last three-month period. The Gulf Coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero is expected to capitalize on the rising demand for distillate fuel. However, there are concerns about Valero’s high debt levels, which leave it vulnerable to any volatility in commodity prices. Also, higher oil and gas prices can lead to increased input costs for Valero, thereby putting pressure on the profit margins. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential VLO.APA Corporation: It is one of the world's leading independent energy firms engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Geographically, the company’s operations are in the United States, Egypt and the North Sea of the United Kingdom. APA also holds acreage in offshore Suriname (South America) and other international locations.This stock, with a Zacks Rank of 3, ended 20.3% higher in the July-September period. APA’s slew of discoveries in offshore Suriname, through its joint venture with TotalEnergies, is a major positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Suriname is expected to become one of APA’s major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the company's high leverage restricts its financial flexibility. Moreover, APA’s significant exposure to forex currency and the associated risks might put off some investors.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These companies are Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Boehringer Ingelheim, Immunex, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacyclics, Merck &amp; Company (MRK), Janssen Biotech, Novartis (NVS), and Novo Nordisk (NVO), according to the Biden administration.Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the news.

AstraZeneca, you're seeing those shares moving this morning flat just barely to the upside here. Bristol Myers Squibb and J&amp;J also on the move. These are just three out of the 10 health care companies signing on to an agreement to negotiate drug prices out this morning.Manufacturers for all 10 drugs selected for negotiation have signed agreements to participate in Medicare's Drug Price Reduction program. The Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation program was implemented over the summer, and it sees a cap for how much a drug can fairly cost for Medicare enrollees. For more on this, we've got Yahoo Finance's reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Hey, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Brad. That's right. Good news, of course, for the Biden administration with these companies all agreeing to sign on with the CMS price negotiations this morning. We saw an indication last week starting with some of these companies starting to say and signal their intent to start these negotiations despite the fact that many of them are still engaged in lawsuits with the administration.Starting last week you saw AstraZeneca, as you can see on your screen, up as late as yesterday some of those companies coming out. Now, the CMS Medicare pricing negotiations are targeting the drugs of several companies. Looking at those that cost Medicare more, especially in plan year 2022, they used that as part of the metric.Story continuesAnd you can see that there are, you know, a number of them that either have broad use among the Medicare population, like more than a million of the enrollees are on some of these drugs and they cost a few hundred or several thousand dollars. As you can see on your screen, that variation between what the companies are charging Medicare.And I reached out to several of those companies, and it seems like while they do still intend to keep the litigation in place, they are willing to negotiate or at least start that process. AstraZeneca said in a comment to Yahoo Finance that they remain committed to having ensure-- to ensuring that patients have access to their drugs and while also planning to participate.Novartis said that they had signed the agreement because it was, quote, their only viable option. It was-- if they had not signed the agreement, Novartis would have faced excessive and crippling fines. Now, those fines that these companies are facing include either a 65% to 95% tax on the drugs or removing their drugs altogether.Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a statement that they continue-- they believe that the drug pricing is going to be damaging to innovation. That's a line that many pharma companies have used in-- especially in their lawsuits, saying that the pressure from these negotiations could damage future investment. Now, what the timeline looks like now is that while these lawsuits are going on in the background, they also do have the first set of-- first round of negotiations starting in the fall.February is when CMS will offer their first price, and then we'll get that look at that final negotiated price by September of next year. So it's about a year before we get any visibility into this. So as you can see, you know, just the starting off point and really the starting gun at this point for this round of negotiations and pharma companies basically kicking and screaming while they enter negotiation process.]"

""While the documents clearly read negative for Amgen ... it does not suggest that Lumakras would need to be pulled from the market,"" said William Blair analyst Matt Phipps.Data from the study showed Lumakras reduced the risk of disease progression in patients with advanced lung cancer by 34%, compared with chemotherapy in a clinical trial.The U.S. health regulator usually follows the advice of its panel, but is not bound to do so. The agency is expected to make a decision on traditional approval for the drug by Dec. 24.Shares of Amgen fell nearly 2% to $261.73.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Pratik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)]"

Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements.

A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 26.2% year over year in July 2023, thereby reaching 95.6% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019.Story continuesLooking ahead, IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, as stated in its latest global outlook for air transport. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in June 2023, the U.S. defense bill for fiscal 2024, reflecting a 3.6% increase over the fiscal 2023 enacted level, got its approval. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, aircraft manufacturers project supply-chain issues to continue to delay aircraft production and deliveries, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in commercial aerospace.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

The country's 30-year yield climbed to its latest 12-year high.Even Japan's 10-year yield, which is capped by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), rose 4.5 bps to a decade high despite the BOJ offering to buy $4.5 billion worth of bonds on Wednesday.Australian, Canadian and British government bond yields have also surged this week.""It's a very difficult market,"" said Sandrine Perret, multi-asset portfolio manager at Unigestion.""It is all back to yields, that's the main driver of markets. The pivot that most investors were expecting in September has not come yet - that's the big driver of all market pricing at the moment.""The moves in bond markets sucked money from all corners into dollars.Still, the dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, eased 0.3%, helping European stocks turn positive after losing as much as 0.6%.

There was no confirmation from Tokyo, where Japan's finance minister and top currency diplomat have made no direct comment on the move.The yen last stood at 149.10 per dollar.The dollar's march pushed the euro to its lowest in 10 months at $1.0448 overnight and sterling to a seven-month trough at $1.20535.The euro last traded at $1.05, up 0.3% on the day.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been pleasing. To wit, it had solidly beat the market, up 28%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts We don't think that Wynn Resorts' modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.Over the last twelve months, Wynn Resorts' revenue grew by 26%. We respect that sort of growth, no doubt. Buyers pushed the share price 28% in response, which isn't unreasonable. If the company can maintain the revenue growth, the share price could go higher still. But it's crucial to check profitability and cash flow before forming a view on the future.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWynn Resorts is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Wynn Resorts has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 28% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 4% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Wynn Resorts better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Wynn Resorts (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

142,664db71d-3a45-3842-8975-049ebe9f203b,WYNN,2023-10-04,7 Vice Stocks to Buy Ahead of a Possible Recession,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-vice-stocks-buy-ahead-013711322.html,1695865031,STORY,"['BUD', 'MCD', 'WYNN', 'RICK', 'PM']","[Ahead of a possible recession, investors may want to consider certain vice stocks to buy. To be sure, the main reason centers on cynicism. With funds tight during a market downturn, consumers won’t open their wallets unless there’s a compelling reason to. And vice plays do exactly that, compel.At the core, sin stocks represent a critical distraction during tough times. During the Great Recession, CNBC mentioned that exotic performance arts centers enjoyed a thriving demand. To be sure, that’s not surprising. With so many folks deflated from the downcycle, large groups turned to “sinful” establishments to lift their spirits.Additionally, these recession stocks may help bring a positive effect in terms of mental health. Now, I’m not a health expert, so do take my idea with a grain of salt. However, some people may just need a pick-me-up. Whether that’s occasionally indulging in fast food or engaging in a consensual “naughty” activity, some businesses may offer stress release. With that, below are vice stocks to consider if you fear a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnheuser-Busch (BUD)Corporate building with Anheuser Busch (BUD) logo on itSource: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.comTo be sure, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) presents tremendous controversies on multiple levels. Admittedly, I have zero desire to get smoke from the uproar surrounding the social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. What I do want to concentrate on is tech entrepreneur Bill Gates, who wagered nearly $100 million on BUD stock. Personally, I think it’s a smart move in the long run.Sure, the controversy regarding gender identity and the implementation of progressive ideals in conservative communities provokes anger. However, what’s the root of the Anheuser-Busch business model? In my opinion, it’s to provide cheap alcoholic beverages. And there’s nothing cheaper and more popular (for some reason) than Bud Light.Yes, Bud Light suffered a huge backlash. However, we’re talking about slipping from number one to number two. A lot of folks still drink this cr…I mean, fine alcoholic beverage. So, it remains a solid idea for vice stocks to buy ahead of a recession. Also, analysts peg BUD as a moderate buy with a $67.39 price target, implying over 24% upside potential.Story continuesMcDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockA fine establishment in the culinary world, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) isn’t exactly what you would call one of the vice stocks. Yeah, it’s kind of a sin to eat at Mickey D’s when you’re visiting France or Italy, for example. However, questionable choices aside, MCD does rank among the top investments to consider if you fear a recession.To be sure, the one reason that McDonald’s finds itself on a list of sin stocks is the underlying business. With Americans collectively suffering from an expansion of the waistline, the Golden Arches don’t exactly help the situation. Still, it does provide a cheap pick-me-up. And when you’re hurting physically, emotionally, and mentally, you deserve a “cheat” day to indulge yourself. In addition, while MCD doesn’t exactly scream “value” from a financial multiples perspective, it features solid long-term revenue growth. As well, the company is consistently profitable.Unsurprisingly, analysts love MCD, pegging it a strong buy with a $332.96 price target, implying over 24% growth.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comSymbolizing a traditional idea for vice stocks to buy ahead of a recession, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of the big tobacco giants. Now, as I’ve mentioned before, global smoking prevalence has slipped for both men and women. Therefore, this framework appears incredibly negative for a tobacco company. Still, an opportunity exists thanks to the underlying vaporizer/e-cigarette business.I don’t want to get into the fine granularity of using e-cigarettes. However, the reality is that while many upstart vaping companies exist that could grab market share in this viable segment, entities like Philip Morris know exactly what smokers want. Thus, they’re able to craft cleaner, digital alternatives that most closely mimic “analog” smoking.How is that different from the upstart vaping companies and their products? You’ll have to talk to smokers. But the main point is that e-cigs that mimic real cigarettes feature “tighter” draws that align with the traditional smoking experience. And it’s this tightness that smokers crave. Lastly, analysts peg PM as a unanimous strong buy with a $115.83 target, implying over 27% upside.Green Thumb (GTBIF)Cannabis leaf on dollar bill. Cannabis StocksSource: ShutterstockAnother conventional idea for sin stocks to buy ahead of a recession, Green Thumb (OTCMKTS:GTBIF) represents a cannabis specialist. You can look at its website and you’ll find an ample amount of word salad. But really, once you get past the health, happiness, and comfort shpiel, what you’re left with is a cannabis firm.Fundamentally, what could make GTBIF one of the recession stocks to consider is the possible industry pivot. Recently, I discussed the implications of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommending the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. Basically, this directive came from the very top, President Joe Biden.Ultimately, the DEA must make the decision whether it wants to reschedule marijuana. However, if it ends up doing so, it could be hugely important for Green Thumb and the cannabis industry. For what it’s worth, analysts are enthusiastic about GTBIF, pegging it a strong buy. As well, the $14.55 price target implies over 31% growth potential.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.Source: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for sin stocks to mitigate the risk of a recession, what better way than to go to Sin City via Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN). As one of the top developers and operators of high-end hotels and casinos, Wynn may offer economic insulation. To be fair, it’s a risky concept. Still, because Wynn caters to a wealthier clientele, it just might pan out.Another factor that could support WYNN through a recession is revenge travel. Yes, it’s a catalyst that really hit its stride last year, as both domestic and international restrictions faded. However, the power to get out of the house remains strong this year. Granted, some of this sentiment has faded amid rising inflation. Still, Wynn’s higher-income base should be able to weather the storm.For full disclosure, Fintel’s options flow screener – which exclusively filters for big block trades likely made by institutions – shows heavy bearish wagers this month, including bought puts and sold calls. Still, the analyst community rates WYNN a strong buy with a $132.40 target, implying 46% growth.RCI Hospitality (RICK)Free stage with lights, lighting devices. Gloomy entertainment stocksSource: Oleksandr Nagaiets / Shutterstock.comClosing out the final two ideas for vice stocks to buy ahead of a recession, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) is what you might call a performance arts center for adults. Mostly catering to people who identify as male, RCI patrons enjoy live visual arts performances. Often, the experience involves smoke, lights and loud music. I’ll just leave it at that.Fundamentally, RCI provides a critical distraction. As the previously mentioned CNBC article pointed out, such establishments have a track record of robust performance during market downcycles. While every recession is different, I don’t expect much to change. If the Federal Reserve fails to engineer a soft landing, you should consider RICK.To be fair, it’s a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Since the January opener, shares have tumbled almost 34%. That’s obviously not encouraging. Nevertheless, the two analysts who cover RICK love the idea. Both rate it a buy with an average price target of $125.50, implying just over 109% upside.PLBY Group (PLBY)Image of the Playboy (PLBY) logo at the company's Westwood, California headquarters.Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.comThe one special purpose acquisition company that polite society doesn’t want you to know about, PLBY Group (NASDAQ:PLBY) merged with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. in early 2021. Under the PLBY umbrella is the media and lifestyle brand Playboy. Another entity in the more extreme end of the fine arts industry, PLBY offers a certain appeal.It’s so appealing, in fact, that you shouldn’t visit its website. Sure, it may be for research – and notice I’m not putting quotation marks on it – but you’ll have a difficult time explaining that to your significant other (or HR). Still, from a relevancy standpoint, PLBY represents one of the vice stocks to buy ahead of a recession because of its pick-me-up potential.However, the one factor you must know is that you’re taking an extreme risk with PLBY. Priced at 85 cents a pop, shares have lost almost 92% of equity value since the SPAC merger. That said, analysts rate it a strong buy with a $2.85 target, implying over 235% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:ZTS) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 12% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 84% in that time.While the stock has fallen 3.7% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Zoetis While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Zoetis' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Zoetis's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 90% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveZoetis provided a TSR of 11% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 14% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes Zoetis a stock worth watching. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Zoetis better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Eli Lilly (LLY) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.95 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 2, 2023.Eli Lilly's Earnings ESP sits at 2.43%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.95 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88.LLY is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Zoetis (ZTS).Zoetis is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 2, 2023. ZTS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.36 a share 30 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zoetis is $1.36, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.09%.Story continuesLLY and ZTS' positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Year to date the ETF is down a whopping 21%.Much of the damage on the normally ""safe-haven"" area of the market has to do with higher rates.Stocks for companies that range from electricity providers to water suppliers normally offer dividends. But those payouts don’t look as appealing to investors when compared to soaring bond yields in a tight monetary policy environment. On Tuesday, the two-year Treasury note hovered around 5.15% while the 10-year touched 4.79%.“Many utilities currently offer forward yields near 5%. However, when investors can obtain risk-free Treasuries offering yields between 4.5% to 5.5%, depending on the maturity, the risk-reward trade off for holding utilities is much less attractive, “ equity analyst Daniel Rich at CFRA Research told Yahoo Finance.Jim Shandalov, vice president at NextEra Energy Resources, California Governor Gavin Newsom (R), and former Mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa (C) walk along the construction of the battery storage facility for a solar farm. (John G. Mabanglo-Pool/Getty Images) (Pool via Getty Images)Additionally, the Federal Reserve's interest rate mantra of ""higher for longer"" also means the cost of capital will stay elevated, another reason why the sector sold off aggressively last quarter. The market expects investments for new power plants, aging infrastructures, and renewable technologies will cost more.Utility stocks were already in a downward trend since the start of the year as investors rotated into growth names. But the selling intensified last week when NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NEE) focused on renewables, cut its growth target by half to 6%, through at least 2026.""Tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates obviously affect the financing needed to grow distributions at 12%,"" read the company statement. Some of the worst performers in the utility sector year to date include NextEra Energy, AES Corp (AES), and Eversource Energy (ES), down 52%, 37%, and 33% respectively.Story continues""While the sector is very out of favor, we think the sell-off presents some attractive buying opportunities for names with competitive earnings and dividend growth potential,"" said CFRA's Rich.""Among some of the larger names, we maintain Buy opinions on NextEra, Duke Energy (DUK), and American Electric Power (AEP),"" he added.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) is down 21% year-to-date. Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferre joins the live show to explain how higher interest rates are taking a toll on the sector.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: Yesterday was a tough day to be a utility. The sector saw its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 2020 as Fed officials reiterated a hawkish tone around future rate hikes. Here with what's ahead for the sector is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines, what are you watching?INES FERRE: Yeah, the utility sector, as you just mentioned, has really taken a beating, and a lot of this has to do with higher interest rates. But let's take a look at our YFi Interactive so you can see XLU. That's the S&amp;P 500 sector ETF for utilities. Year to date, XLU is down 21%. Compare that to communication services, which is up 35%, technology up 30%.Now, again, higher interest rates, this is the big problem. And this is for two reasons, one of them being that utility stocks are dividend stocks for the most part. So they yield dividends. And when you compare that to bonds, which are seeing higher rates, yesterday the 10-year Treasury hit its highest yield since 2007 at 4.6%. Well, compare that to the utility sector average dividend yield, which is at 3.4% So you can see how investors would shift towards bonds simply because they're getting a higher yield on those bonds versus the dividends.Meanwhile, the other reason being that capital is more expensive for these stocks. As the Fed funds rate has gone higher, of course, capital is more expensive, so these utility companies, which have to upgrade their electrical systems, which have to invest in renewable energy stocks and renewable energies, this is very capital intensive, and so that requires more capital, and that's worse for the bottom line for these companies.Story continuesThe pain has been exacerbated by something that's been going on in the industry. And I'm going to pull up the YFi Interactive again so you can see some of the utility players year to date. The worst performers, you're seeing AES down here down 53% year to date and also NextEra Energy down 38% year to date.Now, NextEra Energy Partners, that's a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, and they recently revised down their annual growth expectations through 2026 citing higher borrowing costs. Again, the cost of capital being more expensive, this makes it more difficult, more challenging to fund projects.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Appreciate that update. Thank you so much, our very own Ines Ferre.]"

BNY Mellon Natural Resources A (DNLAX) is a potential starting point. DNLAX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerBNY Mellon is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of DNLAX. BNY Mellon Natural Resources A debuted in October of 2003. Since then, DNLAX has accumulated assets of about $186.48 million, according to the most recently available information. David Intoppa is the fund's current manager and has held that role since November of 2020.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 14.37%, and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 31.66%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, DNLAX's standard deviation comes in at 28.16%, compared to the category average of 16.67%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 28.84% compared to the category average of 18.29%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.14, so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. The fund has produced a positive alpha over the past 5 years of 3.9, which shows that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, DNLAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.14% compared to the category average of 1.52%. DNLAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $1,000; each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, BNY Mellon Natural Resources A ( DNLAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, BNY Mellon Natural Resources A ( DNLAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

The VIX Index is based on real-time prices of options on the S&amp;P 500® Index (SPX) and is designed to reflect investors' consensus view of future (30-day) expected U.S. stock market volatility.  The new Credit VIX Indices aim to provide a comparable benchmark index for the credit markets, so investors will have a broader view of volatility in this important additional asset class.""As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the VIX Index this year, we couldn't be more excited to continue our track record of innovation and collaboration with S&amp;P DJI by extending the VIX Index methodology into the fixed income space,"" said Rob Hocking, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. ""Interest in this asset class continues to grow amidst a rising rate environment, and we expect these indices will help investors better track credit market volatility, manage corporate credit risk, or implement yield-enhancement and hedging strategies.

""The Credit VIX Indices are expected to provide new clear signals on bond market sentiment, and act as a new barometer of corporate credit risk in North America and Europe. Designed to track the level of uncertainty in global credit markets over various time horizons, this new suite of indices is expected to allow market participants to better track credit market volatility and manage corporate credit risk.""Similar to the VIX Index, the new Credit VIX Indices are designed to track near-term uncertainty around corporate credit risk by measuring the market's expectation of how volatile credit default swap (CDS) index spreads will be over the next 30 days. Options with varying strikes convey different information about the expected future movement in credit spreads; the Credit VIX Methodology is designed to extract information from available options strikes and distill it to one number that represents a consensus view on near-term CDS index spread volatility.Cboe's planned launch of the new Credit VIX Indices adds to its suite of forward-looking option-implied volatility indices. The new indices follow Cboe's recent launch of the Cboe 1-Day Volatility Index (VIX1D) and the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX), which were also developed in collaboration with S&amp;P DJI.  To learn more about Cboe Labs, visit https://www.cboe.com/labs/.Cboe Media ContactS&amp;P DJI Media ContactCboe Analyst ContactAngela TuAlyssa AugustynKenneth Hill, CFA+1-646-856-8734+1-773-919-4732+1-312-786-7559atu@cboe.comalyssa.augustyn@spglobal.comkhill@cboe.comAbout Cboe Global Markets, Inc.Cboe Global Markets (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to people around the world.

However, American Express’s annual earnings estimates are slightly down over the last quarter making this steep discount less compelling.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWhile not at a far stretched premium to the benchmark, Visa’s stock trades at 26.7X forward earnings and nicely beneath Mastercard’s 32.6X.Furthermore, it's very noteworthy that Visa’s FY23 and FY24 earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last quarter offering further support to its reasonable P/E valuation while Mastercard’s FY23 EPS estimates are slightly down but FY24 estimates are modestly higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAmerican Express stock is certainly compelling in many aspects but currently lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) along with Mastercard shares while Visa’s stock sports a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.The Federal Reserve’s September meeting and Jerome Powell’s tone afterwards has dampened hopes of a soft landing. The central bank’s battle against inflation is far from over and there are many other challenges that are coming to hit the economy in the coming months. According to a report by Fortune, Jesse Wheeler, senior economist at the decision intelligence firm MorningConsult, recently warned that the market could face several challenges as the analyst sees “storm clouds out there forming.”One of these storms could be the threat of government shutdown (yet again). Some other challenges highlighted by analysts include rising oil prices and the UAW strike that is hitting major automakers in the US. The Fortune report cited Wells Fargo senior economist Mike Pugliese, who said that the impact of a possible government shutdown would be severe.“While there is never a good time for the federal government to shut down, the potential for one in the current economic environment is more concerning. Not only would a shutdown reduce economic growth modestly, but it would create a data vacuum at a time when the path ahead for the economy is highly uncertain,” Pugliese said.But markets are almost always facing some sort of storms. For beginner investors, it all boils down to finding solid companies and waiting it out.MethodologyFor this article, we first listed all the holding of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and then gauged hedge fund sentiment for all these stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We then picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We skipped companies that are cyclical, are about to acquired or are going through a lot of volatility and uncertainties. Analysts and experts recommend beginner investors to have exposure to broader market ETFs to have a safety cushion and almost guaranteed gains (albeit small) over longer periods of time. That’s why we decided to use the holdings data of the SPY ETF.Story continuesBest Stocks for BeginnersPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashBest Beginner Stocks To Buy Now15. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 15th in our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has strong growth catalysts on the back of its AI offerings. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) earlier this year introduced an AI product suite and is also integrating several generative AI features in its existing products.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company. The biggest stakeholder of Adobe during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $658 million stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”14. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the safest stocks out there. The healthcare services company is operating in an industry that is resilient and does not feel drastic effects of broader market downturns. The company has increased its dividends consistently for the last 14 years now.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 111 hedge funds reported owning stakes in UNH. The most significant stakeholder of the firm during this period was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”13. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy for long-term growth. Analysts believe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will launch several new products to grab the lucrative generative AI market in the coming weeks and months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) would be the biggest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chips market.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AMD. The most significant stakeholder of the company was Philippe Laffont’s  Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the June 2023 quarter the AI bubble continued to inflate. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as a key challenger to Nvidia, will benefit from increased demand for its next generation semiconductor chips. AMD’s share price is reflecting very bullish sentiment and the share price has run ahead of a reasonable base case valuation. Accordingly, we divested our entire position and moved AMD to our Bench.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is a strong dividend-paying bank stock with stability and strong fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) shares have gained about 38% over the past 12 months. Thanks to its size and dominance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) usually does not feel any effects of banking sector jitters since depositors flock to major banks like JPMorgan when small banks falter.11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks to buy for beginners. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) earlier this year launched several new features for its CRM platform. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) recently held its Dreamforce conference and investment firm Baird praised the event. Baird analyst Rob Oliver said he came out of the event feeling positive about the company’s AI offerings. The analyst has a $220 price target and a Neutral rating on the stock.Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff in Q2 earnings call talked about Salesforce’s generative AI initiatives in detail and said:“We’re democratizing generative AI, making it very easy for our customers to implement every job, every business in every industry. And I will just say that in the last few months, we’ve injected a new layer of generative AI assistance across all of the Customer 360. And you can see it with our salespeople who are now using our Sales Cloud GPT, which has been incredible, what we’ve released this quarter to all of our customers and here inside Salesforce. And then when we see that, they all say to themselves, you know what, in this new world, everyone can now be in Einstein. But democratizing generative AI at scale for the biggest brands in the world requires more than — that’s just these large language models and deep learning algorithms, and we all know that because a lot of our customers kind of think and they have tried and they go and they pull something off a Hugging Face, it is an amazing company.We just invested in their new round and grab a model and put some data in it and nothing happens. And then they don’t understand and they call us and say, hey, what’s happening here? I thought that this AI was so amazing and it’s like, well, it takes a lot to actually get this intelligence to occur. And that’s what I think that’s the value that Salesforce is bringing is that we’re really able to help our customers achieve this kind of technological superiority right out of the box just using our products in a low code, no code way. It’s really just democratization of generative AI at scale. And that is really what we’re trying to achieve that at the heart of every one of these AI transformations becomes our intelligent, integrated and incredible Salesforce platform, and we’re going to show all of that at Dreamforce.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”10.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.29%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.87%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 3.71% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.68% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.93% in that time.Qualcomm will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Qualcomm to post earnings of $1.91 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 38.98%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.51 billion, down 25.3% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.03% higher within the past month. Qualcomm is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Qualcomm has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.16 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.61, so we one might conclude that Qualcomm is trading at a discount comparatively.Meanwhile, QCOM's PEG ratio is currently 0.76. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Wireless Equipment stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.33 based on yesterday's closing prices.Story continuesThe Wireless Equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Inflation has been showing signs of easing, which has seen investment in construction projects picking up lately.The Commerce Department said on Oct 2 that spending on construction projects was primarily driven by investment in the housing sector. Given this scenario, investing in homebuilding stocks like Toll Brothers Inc. TOL, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, NVR, Inc. NVR and PulteGroup PHM would be a wise decision.Construction Spending ExpandsThe Commerce Department reported that spending on construction projects increased 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,983.5 billion in August after rising 0.9% in July and coming in line with economists’ expectations. Year over year, construction spending jumped a solid 7.4% in August.Spending on private construction projects rose 0.5%, with investment in private residential projects advancing 0.6% after rising 1.6% in July. Overall spending on private construction projects rose 1.2% in July.Construction spending totaled $1,284.7 billion in the first eight months of this year compared to $1,233.4 billion for the same period in 2022.Construction spending on private non-residential structures such as factories increased 0.3% in August, while manufacturing construction projects jumped 1.2%.A shortage of homes available for sale is fueling investment in private residential projects, although mortgage rates remain sky-high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 7.31% last week, the highest level since December 2000.However, this appears to be the new normal. Spending on multi-family residential projects jumped 0.6% in August, while spending on single-family home projects increased 1.7%.The homebuilding sector had been the mainstay of construction spending during the peak of the pandemic and months following that as more people opted for single-family homes.Story continuesHowever, inflation has had the biggest and most far-reaching impact on private housing projects as the Fed’s monetary tightening campaign has been taking its toll on the housing sector owing to higher mortgage rates.The current housing market is still grappling with a significant shortage of single-family homes available for sale. Despite the high cost of borrowing, this scarcity has led to sustained investments in construction projects, especially in single-family homes. Demand for housing remains robust, encouraging investments in new housing developments.Moreover, inflation has seen a notable decline over the past year, and there are signs of a slowdown in the labor market. These developments have sparked optimism and the Federal Reserve has also said that it will go for another quarter percentage point interest rate hike in November before starting to cut rates in 2024. Such a move would likely lead to a reduction in mortgage rates, which is seen as a positive development for the housing market. Lower mortgage rates can make homeownership more affordable and potentially stimulate further demand in the real estate sector.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in spending on construction projects. We have narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Toll Brothers Inc. builds single-family detached and attached home communities; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves.

So, the good news is that we have, now, another option for countries,"" Poonawalla told Yahoo Finance.The relationship with the University of Oxford also predates the pandemic, Poonawalla said, noting that this was the original vaccine the duo were working on before they pivoted to the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine to address the pandemic.SII said it has already begun to produce doses of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine, in anticipation of the rollout next year. It already has 20 million doses and is expecting to scale up to 200 million doses over the next two years.A single dose will cost less than $5, Poonawalla said.Portrait of a child in a clinic in Africa about to be vaccinated with the doctor beside him. (Getty Images) (Media Lens King via Getty Images)Manufacturing in AfricaThe Serum Institute was among limited providers of COVID-19 doses on the African continent before it had to restrict exports, per the Indian government's request, to utilize doses domestically. That damaged the relationship between the sub-Saharan countries and the world's largest vaccine maker. It also highlighted an even bigger problem — there were few manufacturing options on the continent to product doses at scale.Story continuesThat resulted in calls for equity in the Global South, from advocates and governments, which saw a number of commitments and plans from companies like Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and BioNTech (BNTX). Pfizer used an existing partner, the Biovac Institute, to produce doses in South Africa. Moderna committed to opening a facility in Kenya.While none of those efforts were intended to address the immediate needs of the pandemic, they are contributing to a growing effort to get more doses produced on the continent. Some efforts have since waned.BioNTech committed to a project in Rwanda, where it would ship smaller manufacturing containers, as well as discussed plans for a plant in South Africa. The latter idea has been scrapped, according to recent reports.Meanwhile, the Mastercard Foundation has partnered with the Institut Pasteur de Dakar to invest in manufacturing in Senegal. This will help the African Union meet its goal of producing 60% of the continent's vaccine needs by 2040.The Serum Institute, in the meantime, struck a partnership with Aspen Pharmacare — which had previously partnered with Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) for its COVID vaccine — to produce multiple vaccines. The agreement does not include the malaria vaccine, which Serum is producing in India.""Our partnership with Aspen is very keen to develop that and to assure the countries in Africa, 'Look, we're starting to do things here.' And it's not just the Serum Institute, it's be other companies ... manufacturing and making the continent in some way a little more self-reliant,"" Poonawalla said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices]"

These companies are Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Boehringer Ingelheim, Immunex, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacyclics, Merck &amp; Company (MRK), Janssen Biotech, Novartis (NVS), and Novo Nordisk (NVO), according to the Biden administration.Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the news. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: So let's take a look at some pharma shares though here. AstraZeneca, you're seeing those shares moving this morning flat just barely to the upside here. Bristol Myers Squibb and J&amp;J also on the move. These are just three out of the 10 health care companies signing on to an agreement to negotiate drug prices out this morning.Manufacturers for all 10 drugs selected for negotiation have signed agreements to participate in Medicare's Drug Price Reduction program. The Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation program was implemented over the summer, and it sees a cap for how much a drug can fairly cost for Medicare enrollees. For more on this, we've got Yahoo Finance's reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Hey, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Brad. That's right. Good news, of course, for the Biden administration with these companies all agreeing to sign on with the CMS price negotiations this morning. We saw an indication last week starting with some of these companies starting to say and signal their intent to start these negotiations despite the fact that many of them are still engaged in lawsuits with the administration.Starting last week you saw AstraZeneca, as you can see on your screen, up as late as yesterday some of those companies coming out. Now, the CMS Medicare pricing negotiations are targeting the drugs of several companies. Looking at those that cost Medicare more, especially in plan year 2022, they used that as part of the metric.Story continuesAnd you can see that there are, you know, a number of them that either have broad use among the Medicare population, like more than a million of the enrollees are on some of these drugs and they cost a few hundred or several thousand dollars. As you can see on your screen, that variation between what the companies are charging Medicare.And I reached out to several of those companies, and it seems like while they do still intend to keep the litigation in place, they are willing to negotiate or at least start that process. AstraZeneca said in a comment to Yahoo Finance that they remain committed to having ensure-- to ensuring that patients have access to their drugs and while also planning to participate.Novartis said that they had signed the agreement because it was, quote, their only viable option. It was-- if they had not signed the agreement, Novartis would have faced excessive and crippling fines. Now, those fines that these companies are facing include either a 65% to 95% tax on the drugs or removing their drugs altogether.Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a statement that they continue-- they believe that the drug pricing is going to be damaging to innovation. That's a line that many pharma companies have used in-- especially in their lawsuits, saying that the pressure from these negotiations could damage future investment. Now, what the timeline looks like now is that while these lawsuits are going on in the background, they also do have the first set of-- first round of negotiations starting in the fall.February is when CMS will offer their first price, and then we'll get that look at that final negotiated price by September of next year. So it's about a year before we get any visibility into this. So as you can see, you know, just the starting off point and really the starting gun at this point for this round of negotiations and pharma companies basically kicking and screaming while they enter negotiation process.]"

The company again said that its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos.A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The jury in the case had ordered the company to pay $37.2 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages, though that amount was automatically reduced to $186.5 million under state law.In reversing the verdict and ordering a new trial, a three-judge panel of the appeals court found that the trial court failed to fulfill its ""gatekeeping role"" of assessing whether the plaintiffs' experts based their testimony on sound science.In their opinion, the judges found that three experts had not explained the facts or methods they used to support their opinions that the plaintiffs got cancer from being exposed to asbestos in talc products.J&amp;J is separately suing one of those experts, Jacqueline Moline, over a study she co-authored in 2019.

That verdict was upheld by an appeals court, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review it.J&amp;J has recently won reversals of some cases that went against it, including of a $117 million verdict in the same New Jersey appeals court and a $120 million verdict in New York.The company's latest win comes after it failed for a second time in July to move tens of thousands of claims over talc into bankruptcy court, where it hoped to resolve them through a proposed $8.9 billion settlement. It is appealing that ruling.Trials had mostly been on hold while J&amp;J petitioned the bankruptcy court, but will now be able to resume. One trial that was allowed while the bankruptcy petition was pending ended with an $18.8 million verdict for a terminally ill California man.J&amp;J has said the cost of its talc-related verdicts, settlements and legal fees have reached about $4.5 billion.The company stopped selling talc-based baby powder in favor of cornstarch-based products, citing an increase in lawsuits and ""misinformation"" about the talc product's safety.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns. We’re attracted to RSG’s leading position in a stable business with a high degree of recurring revenue, and we believe the company is at an inflection point with its pricing strategy and landfill asset utilization.

The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience.

These companies are Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Boehringer Ingelheim, Immunex, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacyclics, Merck &amp; Company (MRK), Janssen Biotech, Novartis (NVS), and Novo Nordisk (NVO), according to the Biden administration.Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani discusses the news. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: So let's take a look at some pharma shares though here. AstraZeneca, you're seeing those shares moving this morning flat just barely to the upside here. Bristol Myers Squibb and J&amp;J also on the move. These are just three out of the 10 health care companies signing on to an agreement to negotiate drug prices out this morning.Manufacturers for all 10 drugs selected for negotiation have signed agreements to participate in Medicare's Drug Price Reduction program. The Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation program was implemented over the summer, and it sees a cap for how much a drug can fairly cost for Medicare enrollees. For more on this, we've got Yahoo Finance's reporter Anjalee Khemlani. Hey, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Brad. That's right. Good news, of course, for the Biden administration with these companies all agreeing to sign on with the CMS price negotiations this morning. We saw an indication last week starting with some of these companies starting to say and signal their intent to start these negotiations despite the fact that many of them are still engaged in lawsuits with the administration.Starting last week you saw AstraZeneca, as you can see on your screen, up as late as yesterday some of those companies coming out. Now, the CMS Medicare pricing negotiations are targeting the drugs of several companies. Looking at those that cost Medicare more, especially in plan year 2022, they used that as part of the metric.Story continuesAnd you can see that there are, you know, a number of them that either have broad use among the Medicare population, like more than a million of the enrollees are on some of these drugs and they cost a few hundred or several thousand dollars. As you can see on your screen, that variation between what the companies are charging Medicare.And I reached out to several of those companies, and it seems like while they do still intend to keep the litigation in place, they are willing to negotiate or at least start that process. AstraZeneca said in a comment to Yahoo Finance that they remain committed to having ensure-- to ensuring that patients have access to their drugs and while also planning to participate.Novartis said that they had signed the agreement because it was, quote, their only viable option. It was-- if they had not signed the agreement, Novartis would have faced excessive and crippling fines. Now, those fines that these companies are facing include either a 65% to 95% tax on the drugs or removing their drugs altogether.Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a statement that they continue-- they believe that the drug pricing is going to be damaging to innovation. That's a line that many pharma companies have used in-- especially in their lawsuits, saying that the pressure from these negotiations could damage future investment. Now, what the timeline looks like now is that while these lawsuits are going on in the background, they also do have the first set of-- first round of negotiations starting in the fall.February is when CMS will offer their first price, and then we'll get that look at that final negotiated price by September of next year. So it's about a year before we get any visibility into this. So as you can see, you know, just the starting off point and really the starting gun at this point for this round of negotiations and pharma companies basically kicking and screaming while they enter negotiation process.]"

(United) United AirlinesUnited Airlines is betting that the constraints limiting airline schedules will persist for years, and it’s responding with a new order for 110 Airbus and Boeing planes.The deal is for 60 Airbus A321neos and 50 Boeing 787-9s for delivery between 2028 and 2031, the Chicago-based carrier unveiled Tuesday. It also includes 40 additional purchase rights for the A321neo and 50 options for the 787. The orders build on ones United placed with Airbus and Boeing for narrowbodies in 2021 and primarily widebodies in 2022.The orders are driven, in part, by United’s need to replace older planes by the end of the decade, as well as grow at capacity-constrained airports around the world. Those constraints include the air traffic controller shortage in the U.S. and Europe, and government restrictions to achieve climate and other goals – for example, the Netherlands’ plan to cut flights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport next summer.For an airline to grow under these constraints, they need to operate aircraft with more seats, a strategy known as “upgauging.”United’s latest aircraft order will enable it to add seats to its existing schedules at constrained airports, including Newark, San Francisco, and in Europe and Asia. “Gauge growth is how United will manage an increasing number of limitations on runways, air space, and gate capacity at the nation’s largest airports while still growing,” said Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella Tuesday.The A321neos will seat 200 passengers – they will replace Boeing 757-200s that seat up to 176 passengers. The new 787-9s will seat 257 passengers versus just 167 to 240 passengers for the current Boeing 767s. The carrier plans to retire its 757s and 767s by the end of the decade.United does not intend to replace its 757s and 767s with A321neos and 787s on a one-for-one basis, Nocella said. However, the strategy is to use the new planes to grow via more seats per flight rather than more flights overall.Story continuesIn fact, at Newark, which was plagued by weather and air traffic control-related delays this summer, the carrier plans to operate fewer daily departures than it did in 2019 over the long term.The airline is scheduled to take delivery of its first A321neo — part of its 2021 airplane order — next week, Nocella said. United plans to introduce it on revenue flights between Chicago and Phoenix in December.New Aircraft ShortageBoth Airbus and Boeing face challenges meeting their aircraft delivery commitments on time. The situation is made worse by delays at their suppliers, including the well-documented issues facing Pratt &amp; Whitney’s geared turbofan engines on the A320neo family.Air Lease Corp. Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy in September called the situation for airplane makers “a real problem area,” that was fueling increased demand for leased aircraft.Airlines are eager to lock in delivery slots. Air Canada, Air France-KLM, Cathay Pacific, and Latam Airlines have all ordered additional Airbus and Boeing models in the past two weeks.Nocella cited the supply chain limits in his comments, adding that United’s deliveries this year are “significantly” delayed and that is unlikely to change for years to come. The timing of deliveries for the airline’s new order at the end of the decade is later than is typical for United, he said.Asked about United’s willingness to place such a large order amid global economic uncertainty, Nocella said the carrier was confident in its outlook and had flexibility to adjust the timing of plane deliveries and other aspects of the deals.United and its peers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, continue to see strong travel demand this fall in part fueled by large international networks. Their U.S. domestic-focused competitors – Breeze Airways, Frontier, JetBlue, and Spirit – have reported weak bookings and revised down their earnings estimates with some expecting losses in the third quarter.All airlines face increased cost pressure driven by rising fuel prices and new, more costly labor agreements. Pilots at United recently ratified a new accord with up to 40% pay increases.United had 657 aircraft on firm order at the end of June, its latest fleet plan shows. That includes 45 Airbus A350s that were ordered by the airline before its merger with Continental Airlines in 2010, and have been postponed repeatedly in the decade-plus since.The airline maintains its A350 order, Nocella said. He declined to comment on whether United will ever take delivery of the planes given its plan to take delivery of 150 new 787s — the main competitor of the A350 — between now and the end of the decade.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Boeing and Airbus are the firm's primary customers, with Boeing composing roughly 80% of annual revenue and Airbus composing roughly 15% of revenue. The company is highly exposed to Boeing's 737 program, which generally accounts for about half of the company's revenue.

189,e693d0c4-4073-3b43-a6cf-51390132fd74,CI,2023-10-04,Does Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-cigna-group-nyse-ci-130019080.html,1696338019,STORY,['CI'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group What Is Cigna Group's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Cigna Group had US$32.6b in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$10.4b in cash leading to net debt of about US$22.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Cigna Group's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Cigna Group had liabilities of US$47.3b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$57.2b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$10.4b as well as receivables valued at US$18.3b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$75.8b.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$84.7b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Story continuesCigna Group has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While these numbers do not alarm us, it's worth noting that the cost of the company's debt is having a real impact. Unfortunately, Cigna Group saw its EBIT slide 5.2% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Cigna Group can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Cigna Group actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Our ViewOn our analysis Cigna Group's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For example, its level of total liabilities makes us a little nervous about its debt. We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like Cigna Group commonly do use debt without problems. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Cigna Group's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Cigna Group   you should know about.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

(Nasdaq: SWKS) today introduced the Si469xx family of automotive digital radio coprocessors for future in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. With its combination of integration, flexibility and low cost, the Si469xx family of coprocessors is optimized to operate with Skyworks’ Si479xx Hybrid Software Defined Radio (SDR) Tuners to achieve a cost-effective digital radio receiver. The new Si469xx product family can demodulate and decode up to four digital radio channels supporting HD Radio, DAB/DAB+, DRM (for AM and FM), and CDR, providing high performance and unmatched scalability.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231004508164/en/Skyworks’ Si469xx Product Family Delivers Industry-leading Combination of Integration, Flexibility and Low Cost (Photo: Business Wire)The Si469xx product family supports advanced capabilities such as Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) and seamless linking of digital radio, analog radio and Internet Protocol content. With its integrated customer-programmable microcontroller (MCU), the Si469xx can significantly reduce bill of materials (BOM) costs by eliminating the need for an external MCU and its support components. Software design is simplified through several improvements, including a Demod/Tuner Manager that relieves system developers from having to program low-level radio control functions.As of June 2022, over 59% of all new vehicles delivered in the U.S. contain a factory-installed HD Radio receiver as reported by Inside Radio1. While WorldDAB2, the international association promoting the global adoption of this digital radio transmission standard, notes that in 2022, 96% of new cars sold within the European Union were equipped with DAB+.Story continuesRadios in automobiles have historically been implemented in the head unit (HU) or cockpit system located in the dashboard. However, increasingly radio tuners are implemented in a separate module, often as a remote tuner module (RTM). The RTM offers benefits including reduced cable weight and the ability to design and qualify the radio for use across car models, which decouples it from the evolution of the HU/cockpit system. The cable weight reductions are a result of replacing RF coaxial cabling to the HU with a much lighter twisted pair cabling, typically accomplished with ADI A2B™ technology, which is optimized for automotive digital audio applications, or ethernet.By leveraging separate tuner and coprocessor ICs, Skyworks offers an optimal balance between partitioning and integration, which helps solve thermal challenges associated with RTM applications. This also provides robust scalability and configurability to address multiple regions and performance points. System designers can create a single board design that can be populated with different pin/package and software API compatible devices.""The integration of the Si469xx product family from Skyworks has allowed us to usher in the next generation of remote tuners from HIRSCHMANN MOBILITY together,"" said Adrian Sigg, manager product management at HIRSCHMANN MOBILITY. ""We now offer our customers a cutting-edge product with top performance and optimum cost-benefit relation.""""In recent years, A2B technology has become the industry’s standard for low-latency digital audio connectivity. Our innovation is uniquely tailored for the RTM use case, where it not only offers substantial performance enhancements, but also drives a reduction in overall system costs,"" said Andy Lanfear, general manager, Automotive Audio &amp; Networking at Analog Devices. ""ADI is proud to work with Skyworks in jointly promoting our complementary technologies into this rapidly expanding application area.""""Building on the unparalleled scalability of Skyworks’ automotive radio product portfolio with the added benefits of improved performance, lower system cost and ease of use, the Si469xx family of products enhances our ability to address the needs of future IVI systems by delivering best-in-class capability, flexibility and affordability to our customers,"" said Juan Revilla, vice president and general manager of broadcast products at Skyworks. ""Along with our family of Si479xx Hybrid SDR tuners, this new family of digital radio coprocessors enhances our overall automotive product portfolio and bolsters our strategy in this key secular growth market. Skyworks is strongly positioned to address RTM, SDR and head unit automotive radio implementations.""More information about the Si469xx family of digital radio coprocessors can be found here.

However, lingering supply-chain challenges might continue to delay deliveries and thereby remain a threat to the industry players.Nevertheless, improved projections for air travel, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for companies that are engaged in commercial aerospace operations. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Textron.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 26.2% year over year in July 2023, thereby reaching 95.6% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019.Story continuesLooking ahead, IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, as stated in its latest global outlook for air transport. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in June 2023, the U.S. defense bill for fiscal 2024, reflecting a 3.6% increase over the fiscal 2023 enacted level, got its approval. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, aircraft manufacturers project supply-chain issues to continue to delay aircraft production and deliveries, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in commercial aerospace.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

However, lingering supply-chain challenges might continue to delay deliveries and thereby remain a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, improved projections for air travel, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for companies that are engaged in commercial aerospace operations. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Northrop Grumman NOC, General Dynamics GD and Textron TXT.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises of companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 26.2% year over year in July 2023, thereby reaching 95.6% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019. Looking ahead, IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, as stated in its latest global outlook for air transport. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in June 2023, the U.S. defense bill for fiscal 2024, reflecting a 3.6% increase over the fiscal 2023 enacted level, got its approval. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods.

196,84f0db95-2317-305b-8ab3-420f98f4ded0,NKE,2023-10-04,17 George Soros Stocks that are on Sale Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-george-soros-stocks-sale-012637046.html,1696382797,STORY,"['NKE', 'AMD', 'SE']","[In this article, we will discuss the 17 George Soros Stocks that are on sale now. If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 George Soros Stocks that are on Sale Now.George Soros is one of the greatest investors of all time, renowned for aggressive investment strategies that have netted him billions of dollars over the years. The 93-year-old billionaire investor is best described as a greedy, impulsive risk taker, market-timer, and short seller who is always ready to go against the grain. Averaging gains of over 30% a year between 1970 and 2000 through the Quantum Fund underscores why he is regarded as one of the greatest in the investment circles.The stellar performance is down to the Hungarian-American businessman doing what investors are often advised not to do. The market is always efficient, the share price always reflects all relevant information, and that the stock market is always fairly valued; that’s the general thumb rule that most investors always stick to. However, not George Soros; to him, humans are not rational, especially with money. Therefore, the market can never be efficiently priced.Soros has always stuck to the idea that market prices are inefficient. Instead, they are distorted most of the time from reality.“My interpretation of financial markets directly contradicts the efficient market hypothesis which has been the prevailing theory about financial markets. That theory three claims that markets tend towards equilibrium deviations occur in a random fashion and can be attributed to extraneous shocks if that theory is valid mine is false and vice versa,” Soros once said.The theory that markets are never efficient allowed Soros to turn $12 million in seed funding to well over $20 billion using his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management. With a net worth of over $8 billion, Soros could have been much richer, given that he has donated well over $30 billion to charitable causes.Story continuesSoros is best remembered as the man who broke the Bank of England, generating a single-day gain of over $1 billion at the expense of the British Pound. Using leverage, Soros took a $10 billion short position on the pound, a trade that ended up being one of the greatest of all time, racking $1 billion in profits as the pound imploded.The hedge fund manager also bet $1 billion against the Thai baht as the financial crisis was ensuing in 1997. He bet the currency would implode as the Bank of Thailand had run out of ammunition to support the currency. The currency did implode even though the billionaire had generated significant returns before it imploded. With age slowly catching up with the legendary investor, he has had to relinquish control of Soros Fund Management to his 37-year-old son, Alex Soros. He is tasked with managing over $20 billion.Since 2011, Soros has carried out investment activities through his family office, Soros Fund Management, which most people continue to follow to gain insights into the direction the market is likely to move. The hedge fund relies on diversification to generate returns in the market with stakes in technology companies to healthcare and Industrial goods consumer discretionary. He is also big on renewable energy as one of the proponents of fighting climate change.17 George Soros Stocks that are on Sale NowHorizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP) is one of the biggest holdings in the Soros fund, followed by Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). Soros also has exposure in the tech industry through Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), having also made significant investments in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Soros has also sought exposure to the artificial intelligence boom with stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He has also increased stakes in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), heavily invested in AI large language models.Yet, Soros is sometimes wrong and has endured losses and difficulties in his work. For example, in 2000, he lost about $2 billion when he bet against the rise of technology stocks during the dot-com bubble. In 2016, he lost about $1 billion when he bet against the U.S. stock market after Donald Trump's election victory. In 2018, he faced criticism and backlash from some governments and groups for his support of liberal causes and organizations.Soros admits his mistakes and learns from them. He invests based on ""reflexivity"", which means markets are shaped by people's actions and beliefs. He adapts his strategies to changing situations. With this angle in mind let's explore 17 George Soros stocks that are on sale now.Our methodologyWhile the overall market has turned bullish in 2023, some stocks in the Soros hedge fund have been on the receiving end amid deteriorating macro conditions.

I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe.Story continuesJohn Donahoe: Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. NIKE's foundational competitive advantages are the envy of the industry. As the global athletic market leader, our scale and portfolio allow us to create an impact that only NIKE can. Consumers all over the world recognize NIKE as the number 1 champion for athletes and sport as we fuel inspiration and push the limit of human potential with the industry's most innovative products. Over the past few years, we've navigated through an unprecedented external environment. We've worked through many challenges, societal, geopolitical, global health, supply chain and more. And during this time, NIKE has grown larger and stronger. In fiscal '19, NIKE's revenues were $39 billion.Today, we're over $50 billion. And what's more, our growth has outpaced the overall industry during this period. Let me offer a few examples of how we've redefined the game over the past two years. The consumer told us they wanted lifestyle product, and we delivered, growing Air Force 1, AJ1 and Dunk to be the three largest footwear franchises in industry history. We continue to set the bar in key global sports like basketball and global football. Jordan is now one of the leading brands in North America with potential for so much more. We've accelerated digital capabilities that fuel engagement with our brands and deepen direct consumer connections around the world. The list could go on and on. But we have a saying here at NIKE. There is no finish line.We never settle. We always measure ourselves against our full potential. NIKE has always been synonymous with sport. We're at our best when we deliver breakthrough ideas by lining up innovative product with distinctive storytelling delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences. And when we do it well, we expand and grow the market. Today, as I've just mentioned, we're succeeding in many areas of our business, but we expect more of ourselves and others. For example, over the past few years, we launched new product innovations in running, but we need to drive more meaningful consumer connections among everyday runners and scale these innovations more effectively across the marketplace. Our storytelling has driven energy in many areas, but we have opportunity to cut through with more sharpness and clarity around the performance benefits and distinction of our products.And we built a best-in-class marketplace with unrivaled scale and reach. But we have opportunity to deliver more compelling assortments, particularly when it comes to serving our women consumers. So across our company, we are focused and mobilized to address areas where we need to raise our game while continuing to drive competitive separation across the board. We're aligned. We're confident, and we kick in to a new gear. One recent example, a couple of weeks ago, we had over 300 leaders from across the globe gathered here in Beaverton to immerse ourselves in our fall '24 lineup. Now our teams have been back together in person over the past 15 months, and our innovation pipeline is strong, and it was on full display. The excitement and alignment of our leadership team was clear as we continue to obsess the product and storytelling we'll be bringing to life for consumers at the Paris Olympics and into the fall.Simply put, our teams are on the offense as we compete to win in all segments. And so today, I'd like to offer three examples where NIKE showed our best this quarter, where we brought together product, storytelling and marketplace to connect with consumers and drive results. Let's start with this summer's World Cup. At NIKE, as I've said before, it always starts with great product. And in football, that's led by Phantom Luna and Mercurial, our most innovative football boots as well as our array of national team kits designed for elite female players and last but not least, our style-driven collections that stood out so well this summer. We brought our culture of innovation to life through our storytelling as we dominated the conversation with a leading share of social voice.In particular, we were incredibly effective in reaching Gen Z women through our lens of sports, style and culture. On TikTok, our priority channel for Gen Z, our engaged audience, meaning those who actively interacted with our content, was up 172%, a huge statement of NIKE's ability to connect with authenticity to this important demographic. And we also extended the tournament's energy through our stores. I was in Australia this summer and got to experience our Dream Arena, the immersive retail destination we created for the World Cup by transforming our Sydney flagship store, just the latest example of how we can amplify global sport moments at retail. The experiences inside Dream Arena included the best of NIKE, Jersey customization, local co-creator workshops, NIKE trainer-led workouts, exclusive product launches and more.The response to Dream Arena surpassed our expectations with some great learnings we plan to use at scale moving forward. And all this led to results. In both footwear and apparel, we beat our sell-through plans with strong double-digit growth across men's, women's and kids in Global Football. In EMEA, all our key boot franchises, Mercurial, Phantom, Tiempo and Phantom Luna saw double-digit growth in Q1, leading adult Global Football to grow double digits in the geo. And in APLA, football also grew double digits with strong growth in kid-sized kits as we continue to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the sport. And whether it was from this summer's World Cup and the Euros last summer or the WNBA and our investment in coaching, we are committed to growing the game for women's sports.Next, let's touch on basketball, another area where you can see our end-to-end offense driving accelerated competitive advantage. In basketball, we have an unprecedented portfolio of product. Earlier this month, we announced our latest signature shoe, Devin Booker's Nike Book 1. It's a shoe built for comfort and performance with clean on and off court style. The Nike Book 1 will hit retail in December with consumer energy already building. And the Sabrina 1 continued its very strong sell-through this quarter, with both women's and men's interests high. And just a few hours ago, we launched the LeBron XXI. The XXI built on the success of the XX by keeping its low profile design and adding premium lightweight materials designed to connect with younger generations.And Q1 also saw the official introduction of the Kobe Brand. We commemorated Kobe Day on August 24, with rereleases to very strong demand. In fact, demand's so strong that we only fulfilled a fraction of it. And along with Vanessa Bryant, we also selected six schools to be honored as Mamba programs for the upcoming college basketball season, with both their men's and women's teams having the opportunity to wear Kobe Brand player exclusive footwear. We see huge potential with the Kobe Brand both on and off the court as we continue to honor his legacy. And this quarter, we also brought the energy of basketball directly to the consumer. We hosted tournaments in cities like L.A. and Chicago, culminating with the Nike World Basketball Festival in New York.These events created an electric atmosphere, especially during the NBA off-season like only NIKE can. And in a quarter where Jordan footwear grew double digits, the Jordan Brand demonstrated its power by bringing Zion, Luka and Jayson Tatum to Paris for Quai 54, which is one of the world's biggest streetwear and street ball tournaments that doubled as a showcase of the culture and growing community of basketball. Now moments like these don't just grow competitive separation for NIKE and Jordan. They also are how we grow the game and we grow the broader market. Finally, I'll walk through the geography where our overall vision comes to life best, Greater China. In Q1, Greater China grew double digits for the second straight quarter, and we're taking share in the market.It's in Greater China that we offer the consumer NIKE's most premium and elevated retail. The team gets the most out of our innovative product through world-class and locally relevant storytelling and strong marketplace execution. A great example is our women's business, which outpaced overall growth in the quarter. The work the team has done to serve our women's consumer in Greater China is proof of what NIKE can do when all the pieces are aligned. A highlight in Q1 in Greater China was our 3-day sport festival, Sportchella, where we welcomed thousands of women to connect with our three brands through movement and mindfulness. The team amplified the impact of the festival by partnering with Tmall to create the first Nike Super Brand Week, which drove more than 2 billion impressions.And this partnership seamlessly integrated the events with a digital shopping journey that generated very strong consumer response and engagement. Our Greater China team also brings our brands to life through our best retail experiences fueled by strong and meaningful storytelling. These breakthrough retail experiences highlight our innovations and marketing in a clear package for the consumer. For example, in Q1, our seasonal presentations and curated head-to-toe style guides had very favorable consumer response. And once again, this combination of innovation, storytelling and marketplace execution led to results. We took share in women's in Greater China this quarter, with strong growth across a wide range of products, from footwear with the Motiva and Free Metcon to apparel with our statement bras and leggings.All in all, across our entire portfolio, the Greater China team has orchestrated a fully connected marketplace. They continue to transform digital commerce, launching China-specific versions of our apps, which are faster for consumers and more personalized, including a new Jordan destination to the Nike App in Q1; and their expanding connected partnership, which after just a few quarters is now live in 350 doors across 102 cities and is driving substantially higher member demand versus last quarter. Simply put, Greater China sets the execution standard for us, and our goal is to scale their success across all of our geographies, every sport and every dimension of our business. And that's how we win over the long term. In the end, as I've said, we're focused in moving with great confidence against the opportunities we see.Our teams feel energized, united by our shared passion and urgency for competing at the highest level. We set high expectations for ourselves at Nike. That's what winners do. And now more than ever, we're ready to bring our very best and demonstrate what NIKE is capable of. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.Matt Friend: Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's first quarter results demonstrated the impact of staying on the offense when we drove a quicker return to a healthy marketplace in fiscal '23 and leading with operational discipline as we begin the new fiscal year. We delivered Q1 results in line with our guidance. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale continue to grow on top of extraordinary sales this past year. Both Nike inventory and our total marketplace inventory are healthy. Working capital efficiency is improving with a normalized supply chain. Gross margins are expanding on an operational basis, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and transitory headwinds are abating. In short, we are building on a strong foundation for sustainable and more profitable long-term growth.Before reviewing our financial results, let me first speak to what we are seeing from our consumer in the marketplace and where we are driving focus and attention to unlock even greater potential ahead. In Q1, retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale grew mid-single digits versus the prior year. Our top franchises are driving strong full price sales and our newest product offerings across Nike, Jordan and Converse are generating positive consumer reception. Looking at inventory. We continue to feel very good about our position. NIKE inventory dollars are down 10% versus the prior year. Our total inventory units across the marketplace, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, are down double digits versus the prior year. Partner-owned inventory units are in line with the previous year, with levels planned to remain lean through our second quarter, a meaningful accomplishment after higher levels of wholesale sell-in during fiscal '23.On the whole, we are very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we're seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell-in in our second half. And overall, we're confident in the health and shape of our marketplace. NIKE Direct continues to lead our growth, up 6% versus the prior year. As we deliver on our strategy to elevate the marketplace through premium physical and digital retail experiences, we continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands. And in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year, with increasing average order values. Our stores delivered in an especially strong quarter, with traffic up double digits from last year and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels.This is similar to what we are seeing across the industry. And after seeing this trend build in early July or in early June, our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full price sales across our entire store fleet. NIKE Digital grew 2% with nonlinear comparisons to the prior year, including liquidation actions and a higher number of product launches on the SNKRS app in fiscal '23. Looking through all that. What stands out are the underlying consumer trends we see in our digital business. This includes sustained momentum on the NIKE mobile app with growth in traffic and increasing member buying frequency. We continue to see a growing structural advantage as more consumers start their shopping journeys with us on mobile.Meanwhile, within wholesale, we see largely positive results from our most important strategic partners. Specifically, we were pleased to see high single-digit to low double-digit retail sales growth and strong inventory management with many of our key partners, including DICK's Sporting Goods and city specialty partners in North America, JD, Zalando and Sports Direct in EMEA and Topsports and Pou Sheng in Greater China. We continue the reset of our business with Foot Locker, planning for near-term sales declines as they invest in consumer-right concepts for the future. Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels with no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of NIKE's total business.And looking across the entire marketplace, we are confident in our brand momentum as we accelerate direct consumer connections, elevate our brands and create capacity for long-term growth. Looking ahead, our priorities start with our product pipeline. And over the coming seasons, we will build on the market share gains that we have accelerated in recent years, by scaling newness and innovation across our portfolio, while carefully managing the health of our most iconic product franchises. This year, for example, we will build on the consumer momentum around running and modern comfort with performance and lifestyle franchises such as Infinity, Motiva, Invincible, Vomero 5, V2K and the Air Max 1. We will refresh our basketball portfolio across Nike and Jordan through innovation and style and grow the Kobe brand.We will ignite the next chapters of Pegasus, the Jordan Game shoe and Tech Fleece while continuing to grow powerhouses like Dunk and Metcon. And as we look towards the second half of this fiscal year and beyond from the tenth anniversary of Air Max Day to the Paris Olympic Games, we will introduce our next wave of Nike Air innovation. This will bring our most comprehensive evolution of the Air platform in years, one that we expect to catalyze both our brand and business. We will deliver pinnacle performance innovation to athletes while also scaling into new lifestyle franchises over the next several years. Ultimately, we are focused on scaling a deep, diverse and distinct product portfolio, not just for one quarter or one season, but for years to come.Last, we are turning the corner in driving more profitable growth while also recovering on transitory cost headwinds. This includes structural improvements in profitability in areas such as supply chain, with reduced digital switch shipments and improved digital fulfillment costs enabled by investments in our regional service centers, and a new transportation management system. In addition, NIKE Brand ASPs are up across footwear and apparel across all geographies as we focus on the price value of our products. And in Greater China, consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, healthy inventory and sequential improvement in full price sales will enable us to begin rebuilding towards higher profitability in the geography. Finally, we are focused on improving our marginal cost of growth with more modest increases in operating overhead this fiscal year, following two consecutive years of double-digit growth.We are doing this by unlocking speed and productivity as we transform our operating model to build a faster and more efficient Nike. Now let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. first quarter results. In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 2% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew 6%, with NIKE stores growing 12% and NIKE Digital up 2%. Wholesale grew 1%, reflecting our proactive decisions to restrain inventory supply and prioritize marketplace health, particularly in North America. Gross margin declined 10 basis points to 44.2% on a reported basis, primarily driven by higher product costs, and approximately 90 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, almost completely offset by strategic pricing actions.SG&amp;A grew 5% on a reported basis, primarily due to increased demand creation expenses around World Cup and more moderate increases in operating overhead benefiting from shifts in timing of technology investments for the remainder of the year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to 19.7% for the same period last year. primarily due to a onetime benefit provided by the recent delay of the effective date of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. Diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue declined 1%, with wholesale down 8%, in line with our expectations following our restrained sell-in of marketplace supply. NIKE Direct was up 7% as NIKE stores grew 11% and NIKE Digital grew 4%.EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis, primarily due to strong gross margin expansion. In a competitive environment, our retail sales momentum grew throughout the quarter across NIKE Direct and wholesale. NIKE's back-to-school performance outpaced the broader industry with strong sales from our top franchises and clear consumer excitement around newness. Infinity 4 drove strong full price sales as we partnered with key running specialty accounts to host community activations. Our newest generation of Tech Fleece amplified by strong investment from key marketplace partners drove retail sales up double digits from last year across NIKE Direct and wholesale. Zenvy, Go and Universa fueled double-digit growth in statement leggings with Dunk and Free Metcon driving strong sell-through.And the Jordan brand continued its momentum with double-digit growth, led by Jordan Women's and kids as well as performance basketball. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 6%, with NIKE Direct also up 6%. NIKE stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital declined 2%. EBIT declined 5% on a reported basis. Global Football and fitness grew double digits and women's outpaced our total growth in the geography this quarter. New innovation and styles are resonating with Phantom Luna driving strong sell-through, Metcon up double digits and Motiva, our new walking shoe, off to a great start in creating a new performance category for NIKE. Pegasus, Invincible and Vomero also delivered strong results in the quarter. In addition, statement leggings in shorts grew double digits with integrated brand and retail experiences.And as we deepen our focus on serving all segments of the running community, trail running footwear grew double digits with new product innovation and brand activations. In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 12%. NIKE Direct grew 10%, with NIKE stores up 12% and NIKE Digital up 6%. EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. Throughout the quarter, we saw incredible energy around the return of sport, with thousands of young runners joining in our back-to-school kids race, players across cities taking part in our Jordan Flight basketball tournament and historical highs in social engagement with our neighborhood accounts as consumers joined in hyper local community experiences to celebrate our newest Kobe release. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale grew double digits with another quarter of strong sell-through.In a highly promotional marketplace, we outperformed industry trends with improvement in full price sales. Our performance dimensions led growth with consumer excitement around G.T. Jump, Sabrina 1 and Invincible. And in lifestyle, Vomero and other retro running styles are gaining momentum as we prepare to scale over the coming seasons. In APLA, Q1 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct was up 3% with NIKE stores up 10% and NIKE Digital declining 3%. EBIT declined 17% on a reported basis. Japan, Southeast Asia, India and Mexico led our growth this quarter as we accelerate our momentum in international markets. In particular, store traffic in Japan is returning to pre-COVID levels. Sales through our new Myntra partnership in India are already exceeding plan, and Mexico's digital business delivered double-digit growth.Kids led our growth in the geography, up double digits with strong growth from Mercurial, Court Borough and Fleece. We also saw market share gains in women's lifestyle with positive consumer response to Air Max Koko, V2K and Gamma Force. In addition, Jordan continues its global growth with Luca and Tatum fueling strong momentum in Performance Basketball, and our new streetwear footwear franchise is resonating with consumers. Now let me turn to our financial outlook. As we look forward, we are confident in NIKE's new product innovation pipeline, brand strength, deep consumer connections and the health and shape of our marketplace. Our Q1 results reaffirm our expectation for healthy profitable growth this fiscal year. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow mid-single digits.At the same time, we are closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season and our second half wholesale order book. As a reminder, this growth outlook includes approximately 4 points of headwinds from accelerated liquidation and higher wholesale sell-in during the prior year as we sold roughly five seasons of supply within four financial quarters. Therefore, quarterly comparisons across marketplace channels and in the aggregate, will be nonlinear. We continue to expect gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points on a reported basis, which includes 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year given the promotional environment.We continue to expect SG&amp;A to slightly outpace revenue growth. more specifically at the high end of mid-single digits. We continue to expect other income and expense, including net interest income to be $225 million to $275 million for the year and we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Now let me provide some additional color on our second quarter. We expect second quarter reported revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year, as we faced our most challenging comparisons from fiscal '23. We expect second quarter gross margins to expand approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting benefits from strategic pricing, improved markdowns and lower ocean freight rates partially offset by higher product input costs.We continue to expect a negative impact from 50 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect second quarter SG&amp;A to grow mid- to high single digits. We expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. For NIKE, being on the offense means competing to win now and over the long term. We are confident in our strategy, our leadership position and our ability to create even greater opportunity ahead. With that, let's open up the call for questions.See also 15 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now and 13 Best Food Stocks To Buy Now.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Partners.Robert Drbul: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first question really is, when you talk about the innovation pipeline for fall of '24. Can you just expand a little bit more in terms of the focus or the categories or really sort of what you see driving the business that you laid out at the most recent meeting? And I have a follow-up.John Donahoe: Great, Bob. Well, as I said in my remarks, we cannot underestimate the - understate, really, that the impact of having our teams back together in person over the past 15 months, and we absolutely see that kicking into gear with our product pipeline. And so this past quarter, you heard a couple of great examples of performance innovation around Phantom Luna, our World Cup kits, the Infinity 4, which had one of our latest foam platforms, React X foam, highest energy return and lowest carbon footprint, that will sustain for many quarters and years And over the next six to nine months into the Paris Olympics and default, there are several areas we're very excited about. Matt and I both talked about basketball, I don't think we've ever had a stronger portfolio of basketball shoes, whether it's the Sabrina 1, the LeBron 21, Book 1.Jordan has Tatum, Luka, Zion and a great Game Shoe coming. And then, of course, we have Kobe. So we see real growth, growing our basketball business and growing the game and market of basketball on and off the court. In running, we feel good about the Invincible 3 and Infinity 4, Vomero 5, OPeg 41, we feel very good about coming into Paris as well as the Motiva, which we think have real legs. And then Air. Air is an are putting a huge amount of focus, and we're very excited about the innovations coming in Air, both performance and lifestyle. And so we have the tenth anniversary of Air Max Day in the spring as we move into the Paris Olympics. Air will be an important opportunity both in performance and in lifestyle. So we see several opportunities to build real scalable innovation and growth.Robert Drbul: Got it. Thanks,. And I just have a question. In North America, I guess, in the current quarter, what's the bigger tailwind to the business right now? Is it the Travis Kelce jerseys or the Colorado football merchandise?John Donahoe: Oregon Ducks jersey.Matt Friend: We love the NFL and we continue to see a lot of momentum with Coach Prime, so both.Robert Drbul: Thank you.Operator: Up next is Adrienne Yih, Barclays.Adrienne Yih: Great. Thank you very much. I guess my question is going to be on kind of the shaping of wholesale. Matt, if you can help us out with the - I guess, do we expect direct to be similar to the current quarter and then the balance of that, the kind of up slightly for the current quarter guidance to the balance of that come out of North America wholesale? And then my other question is on the China market. John, you talked about kind of strength and regaining market share. But at the same time, you talked a little bit about continuing to be promotional. It's great to see that you're regaining full price. How much demand creation are you doing there? What does the promotional environment look like exiting the quarter? And any comment on exit trends? How should we think about kind of the trends over the next couple of quarters relative to your long-term algorithm? Thank you very much.Matt Friend: All right. Well, John, why don't I start on marketplace. So Adrienne, when we look at our performance this quarter, I'd be remiss to not just reiterate what I said on the call, which is we saw very strong retail sales in the marketplace up mid-single digits. And in particular, we're very pleased with the performance across a range of our most important wholesale partners, delivering growth high single digit to low double digit. What I said last quarter in terms of the way that I was thinking about channel growth for this year, I said that NIKE Direct would lead our growth. And it did this quarter, and we do expect NIKE Direct to continue to lead our growth throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. The period that we're heading into in Q2 and Q3 is really the higher levels of sell-in that we did last year as we proactively focused on returning our marketplace to a more healthy level.As an example, you might recall our Q2 wholesale revenue last year was up 30% versus the prior year. And so as we face those comparisons, we do expect that NIKE Direct will be the best indication of the growth that we're driving in the marketplace, while we comp those nonlinear comparisons in the prior year. But we feel very good about the health and the shape of our overall marketplace, including in North America. And we're continuing to focus on driving growth across dimensions, across channels, up and down price points and are very focused on building a product pipeline to enable us to do that over the coming years.John Donahoe: And Adrienne, in China, it's interesting. I've been to China twice now in the past four months. And I think, Matt, you were there in August. And I - we feel good about the market there and our position. Frankly, a couple of things stand out. One sport is back in China. You can just feel it. And that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there. And you saw we had double-digit - strong double-digit growth in Q1 and Q2, and we're helping to really drive momentum in Sport there. I talked about Sportchella. I think Matt mentioned the back-to-school kids race. Giannis, it is a tour there this summer that got a huge response outdoor basketball.So we're doing what we do best, which is driving energy and excitement around sport, which then translates into our brand connection and our consumer connection being as strong as it's been in a long time. And as I said, it's perhaps the best example currently where we bring this great innovation with distinctive storytelling with distinctive marketplace reaction. And so even in a promotional period, our full price sell-through and our innovations are connecting well and doing well. And so we got inventory in shape much sooner than the market in China. And so we're playing on the offense. We're playing on our front foot. And we feel good about the opportunities in China in the coming quarters and into the medium to long term.Matt Friend: Yes. And I would just say that I think that the retail sales growth that we referenced in our two biggest wholesale partners is a great indication of the health of our inventory and our ability, especially in this first quarter to flow a complete assortment and season into our retail stores in the marketplace. And that's NIKE at best. Our most premium elevated retail experiences, high levels of seasonal assortments where we can tell stories and really bring the breadth and the dimension to consumers. And we saw that momentum building throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the decision we made to move fast. And even though the marketplace is promotional, we're on our front feet in terms of the way we're able to present our brand and our stories and our products to consumers in that market right now.Operator: Next, we'll take a question from Alex Straton, Morgan Stanley.Alex Straton: Perfect. Thanks so much. I just wanted to focus on kind of the running innovation that you guys highlighted a number of times on the call across areas. I think you had said you launched some running in the last few years, but perhaps it didn't connect as much as you wanted or you wanted to scale it more effectively. So could you just touch on maybe what changed in NIKE's approach in the last few years? And then what you plan to do differently to kind of reignite that? Thanks a lot.John Donahoe: Yes, Alex. As I said, we - we're at best when we align innovative product with distinctive storytelling through a differentiator marketplace. And in running, we have three different categories and running. In racing, we take our performance innovation, which sets the bar in the industry with the Alphafly, the Vaporfly and NEXT%. We have compelling breakthrough storytelling, whether it's breaking to or we reached that elite runner and we reached them through a differentiated marketplace. And so we're doing well there. In trail running, which is the fastest-growing segment, the Peg trail is doing very well. We feel really good about our innovation pipeline and we're increasingly leaning in to the trail running community and to marketplace connection with that trail runner.And then the area that we talked about road running or what we call road running or everyday running, we're very clear we're prioritizing the everyday runner who wants newness and consistency and we're focusing, therefore, on some key models and ensuring that we get in the path of runners. So in terms of innovation, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've had some very good innovation in the last couple of years. The Invincible took some of the performance benefits from our road racing shoes, particularly ZoomX and brought them into an everyday running shoe along with some great cushioning. So good innovation. Similarly, the Infinity 4 brought the React X foam platform, which has got some real characteristics of low-carbon footprint, better high energy, but we're not yet combining those innovations with getting in the path of the everyday runner with a really strong ground game.And so that's what we're focused on. And that starts with distribution, making sure we're breaking through everyday runners shops. So whether that's our own direct channels, wholesale channels, running specialty doors play a really important role. You may have noted we launched the React 4 in partnership with running specialty doors. So that's a step in the right direction, and we're really working to break through in these channels. And then we're working hard to better connect with runners in their community where they are, where it's driving connections through Nike Run Club and our mobile apps being present in marathons and races and just being where runners are. And so in this case, we know what we need to do. We are focused on it, and we are moving with urgency to deliver.Matt Friend: There's also a meaningful opportunity as running influences, lifestyle and sneakers. And as we've had tremendous success from a Classics perspective over the last couple of years, we have a rich heritage of products in our pipeline related to running for decades. And so one of the things that we're also doing is accelerating our opportunity in running lifestyle with some of our best franchises and capturing on that trend and also the consumer shift to modern comfort. And we feel like that one, two punch, as John mentioned, innovation, performance and lifestyle is really going to position us well to take greater to greater - take a greater attack at the running marketplace holistically.Operator: And next up is Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.Matthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So John, maybe could you speak to underlying demand trends as the first quarter progressed? Or any early fall trends that you're seeing in both North America and China. And then multiyear, I'm curious what you see as the next leg of the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy or just any initiatives that you see to drive further market share gains as we look forward.John Donahoe: Actually, Matt, why don't you take the first part of that and close in on demand, and I'll take the second.Matt Friend: Sure. Well, Matt, as I referenced, we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth this quarter. And this quarter, we have a unique dynamic because we saw a difference in what we're reporting or what we're communicating from a retail sales perspective versus where NIKE's reported revenue is, and that's because of the restriction of sell-in that we put into place the last couple of quarters of last year. We do expect that to continue as we go into the second quarter. And so we are planning for retail sales growth to be in line with what we delivered this quarter from a mid-single-digit perspective. When we look at the big consumer moments this quarter, 618 seems like so long ago at this point in time, but 618 in Greater China, we were the number 1 sports brand on Tmall and saw impressive double-digit growth over that time horizon.And within back-to-school, we outperformed the industry. And when you look at our performance over the quarter, we saw momentum building throughout the quarter, heading into back-to-school. And so we were encouraged by what we were seeing from a consumer perspective. I mentioned that we saw high single digit to low double-digit growth in our most important partners and strong growth in NIKE Direct this quarter given what we're anniversarying in the prior year. So we continue to see consumer demand for our brands and for our products to be very, very strong. Sport is growing and the consumer is proving to be resilient. There are some dynamics in terms of shifting that's happening from channels. We saw it in our partners a couple of years ago.And this quarter, we are seeing consumers spending more time in brick-and-mortar locations. But 90% of their shopping journeys are starting with digital. And so we continue to believe that our digital and physical strategy of serving consumers at the right strategy to serve demand as we look forward.John Donahoe: And Matt, if we just extend out as you asked a little bit longer term, we step back, we still see the same fundamentals, which are some structural tailwinds in our industry, right? The definition of sport is expanding. And so with the movement towards health and wellness and fitness and new big areas of movement like dance, one of my favorite. We've had a lot of interaction with breakdancing in the last three months here on campus seeing some of the elite breakdancers who will compete in the Paris Olympics come in. But dance, throughout Asia and other places is a huge market. So we just see an expanding definition of sport where movement has become sport and we're at center of that. The movement towards athleisure, right, there doesn't need to be a trade-off between what you wear on the pitch and at work between comfort and performance and style.Athleisure combines all of those, and we are very well positioned to continue to drive that trend. And then the digital connection of consumers means that sport, whether they're watching it or commerce is always one click away. And our leading portfolio of digital assets gives us a huge advantage there. So those are some structural tailwinds. And then we just do - we're in a great industry with those tailwinds. We've got to do what we do so well, innovation plus great storytelling plus great marketplace, we believe will drive real strong growth, and we see great growth in women's. Jordan, we think, has extraordinary growth. Running, we think we have great growth. Continuing to expand the market in basketball, global football. And as Matt mentioned, this driving performance and then into lifestyle is something that makes our industry, our business and our future quite attractive.Operator: Jay Sole from UBS has the next question.Jay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Matt, you talked about you're seeing underlying structural gains and profitability and margins. Can you just talk about how you're feeling about the long-term opportunity for margin in the context of the long-term guidance you gave a couple of years ago for NIKE's ability to get to a high teens EBIT margin over time? Thank you.Matt Friend: Sure, Jay. Well, we remain confident in our ability to drive our long-term financial goals. And we still believe those long-term goals of profitability are achievable. But the timing is difficult to predict. But the reason why I emphasized what I emphasized this quarter is that I feel - I really feel strongly that fiscal year '24 is a turning point for us and a proof point for NIKE to drive more profitable growth. The structural things that I referenced, the structural drivers, I should say that I referenced, it starts with creating value for the consumer and our products. And we continue to see benefits in our gross margin through strategic pricing and managing the price value of our products with ASPs across the NIKE brand across all geos up this quarter.One of the opportunities we continue to see, and we saw some benefit of it this quarter is lowering our supply chain costs. We've increased the size of our supply chain in the last few years to be able to address the growth that we've seen in our business, both overall and in digital. And now our teams are very focused on driving greater efficiency in the way that we serve consumer demand across channels. And I mentioned a couple of examples like reducing digital split shipments so that a consumer doesn't get two boxes for the same order, the way that we're lowering our outbound fulfillment costs through the investment in regional service centers that are closer to where consumer demand is. And so those are just a couple of examples that we continue to see.And then, of course, we do expect that while the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct at a more digital company and a more profitable company. And there's a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well. So we continue to believe these goals are achievable. And based on our gross margin plans for this year, our performance in the first quarter, we believe we're turning the corner on starting to climb to greater profitability as a company and as a brand.Operator: The next question comes from Piral Dadhania, RBC.Piral Dadhania: Hi. Evening. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been answered. So maybe I could just ask a follow-up, a clarification. Matt, I think you said that in Q1, your partners registered a high single-digit to low double-digit sales growth in the period. I just wanted to understand whether that was their sell-out number or whether that was your sell-in number. Any clarification there would be very helpful.Matt Friend: Sure. That was a sellout number. That was the sales to consumer number.Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Baird.Jonathan Komp: Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Matt, if I could ask a follow-up, just as you think about the second quarter, given some of the unusual comparisons, would you be willing to share any shaping guidance across some of the segments? And then bigger picture, if you could just comment on sort of the shape of the recovery of the sales and the profitability that you're seeing in China? And any thoughts as we look to the balance of the year? Thank you.Matt Friend: Sure. Well, as it relates to the second quarter, what I said was that we expect our growth to be up slightly versus the prior year. I did answer Matt's question just and I'll connect the two together, but we are expecting retail sales to sell out to the consumer to be in line with the mid-single digit that we delivered this quarter across the full marketplace. And the second quarter is really the last season that we've managed the sell-in to a more restricted level so that we could ensure that the marketplace was set right as we look towards the remainder of this year. As far as the comparisons go, Q2, and I think I referenced the wholesale number earlier, but we're comping about 27% currency-neutral growth in Q2, but what we're much more focused on is the quality and the health of the growth that we're delivering in the quarter.And so as you see our gross margins expanding in the second quarter on an operational basis, excluding the impact of FX, we're up 150 basis points and are really encouraged as we think about what we delivered in the first quarter, the improvements we're guiding to and believe we can deliver in the second quarter and then the way that will accelerate through the balance of the year. So as we get into the second half of this year and we think about our gross margins, we're going to start to see even more impact from ocean freight because those are rolling in midway through this quarter. We're expecting to see lower product costs in the second half and our FX headwinds are going to abate a little bit as we get into the back half of this year. And so some of those elements will drive increasing margin expansion as we carry through the balance of the year.I think the last part of your question was on China and profitability. What I would just say is that we know from a long history of managing this business that when you have a healthy marketplace and you're driving full price sales and you are driving productivity in your retail formats, you're -- you've created the environment that's ripe to drive profitability improvement. And as we look at the momentum that we're seeing in Greater China, another quarter of double-digit growth, we're increasingly confident that we're going to begin to rebuild towards higher profitability in that marketplace. That's on the product and marketplace side. And then also I referenced an example where we're lowering our supply chain costs in Greater China. And so we feel we feel quite good with that as well.Our reported numbers in China are going to be challenging for the next couple of quarters because of foreign exchange headwinds. And so we'll continue to try to highlight the opportunities and what we're driving from a profitability perspective, but that's one of the reasons why our EBIT was down this quarter in Greater China as foreign exchange headwinds as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, definitely has created a bit of pressure in the short term. But that's - we're focused on what we can control and continuing to drive a healthy, profitable business in that market and believe the fundamentals for long-term growth and profitability are strong for NIKE.Operator: We'll go next to Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein.Aneesha Sherman: Thank you. So as a result of your direct-to-consumer strategy, you've shifted, I guess, more than 20 points of sales mix from Wholesale to NIKE Digital over the last seven or so years. You're seeing shoppers returning to stores this year. You did make some adjustments to adding physical distribution points. Do you feel like you are in enough physical retail doors today to appeal to a rebalancing of shopping habits? And then a quick follow-up on overheads. You talked about lowering some of the specific costs of direct split shipments and fulfillment costs. Can you give us more color on the investment cycle are on the investment cycle to support the direct business as well as centralized investments like ERP and kind of where you are this fiscal year and next fiscal year? Thank you.John Donahoe: Matt, I'll take the first part, maybe take the second. So Aneesha, again, our entire marketplace strategy is driven by giving consumers what they want, when they want it, how they want it. That starts with our digital properties, our own direct retail, which Matt will talk about in the second part of the answer, but wholesale plays a really important role for us to get the breadth and depth of access to consumers and consumers access to our products. And so as you know, we've really sharpened our wholesale focus over the last few years to focus on fewer multi-brand partners that where we're investing in elevated retail experiences and connected digital membership at scale. And so that's DSG, JD, Zalando, our partners in China.We've got a great launch with Pro Direct, Hibbett will come online with connected membership in October. And so we think there's a lot of growth opportunity with those strategic wholesale partners. We're also putting increased attention on our neighborhood partners who are authenticators. They help authenticate both sport and lifestyle and drive energy and local connections. And then as we said, where we see gaps, whether it's in a price point or a gap in a product segment will selectively add wholesale partners in different geographies and in different segments. And this will be a dynamic thing. I mean we're led by the consumer. We have the blessing of the strongest direct connections in the industry. And with direct connected membership, we can be indifferent about which channel And Matt, you're going to talk a little bit about, I guess, the margins are direct, but the Nike Rise our direct monobrand doors Nike Rise and our well collected doors are doing quite well, and we feel like we're getting our concept right now that we have seasonal right assortments coming into them.We feel very good about our ability to augment where their gaps as well with our own mono-brand doors, also a House of Flight on Jordan. So we feel good about being on the front foot with our marketplace. I think the most wide and connected marketplace offense in the industry.Matt Friend: Yes. And I think I would just add maybe one point and then I'll hit the last part. When I think about the momentum that we've seen over the last several years from a digital perspective. You're right, we have shifted our channel mix, and that's been a consumer-led and a consumer-driven shift based on the consumers' desire to want to connect with NIKE, both through our digital apps and through our stores What we saw this quarter wasn't unexpected for us. And when we look underneath the momentum that we saw in our NIKE mobile app, we saw a strong growth, high single-digit growth in traffic. We saw member activity continue to increase both in terms of engagement and buying behavior and a higher basket size, a higher AOV.And so we continue to be focused on creating the best personalized experience for our members from a digital perspective. And we believe that that's going to continue to fuel growth in our digital business over the long term. I do think this year, the comparisons are going to not be linear as we go quarter-to-quarter channel to channel, given what transpired last year. But what we're seeing from a consumer perspective doesn't shift our dimensionality in terms of needing to do something different in order to serve consumer demand. As John said, we've got the biggest, deepest breadth of distribution of anyone and have the right partners to be able to serve the marketplace. As it relates to overhead, the numbers that I referenced actually impact our gross margins, our lower digital fulfillment cost that sits in our gross margins.And it's something that we've been focused on for some time. We started investing a couple of years ago in regional service centers in North America and in Europe and in pickup points closer to the consumer in Europe, all with the intention of building a supply chain that enables us to serve demand closer to consumers. It's more sustainable because we don't have to put product on airplanes, and leveraging our store footprint through O2O capabilities. And so we've been investing for a few years in developing and scaling those capabilities to be able to serve consumer demand. And as I look forward from here, our investments will be aligned with the way that we grow the business. In other words, we've invested to - and now we're learning to operationalize and take advantage of these capabilities.We are implementing our ERP in North America. We went live with our retail business in the first quarter, and everything has gone well. And we're focused on bringing the second part of our North America business, the wholesale side of our North America business online and our new ERP later this year. So that is our largest investment in transformation of our supply chain and enabling us to operate like a retailer. And I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity that it presents for us to really modernize the way we work and to serve consumers at speed across the marketplace.Operator: And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. It also concludes our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"
198,c930c066-ae1c-3f53-9bef-edf962ae21d6,ZION,2023-10-04,Zions (ZION) Surges 30% in Q3: What's Behind this Turnaround?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zions-zion-surges-30-q3-105600489.html,1696416960,STORY,['ZION'],"[After a rough start to 2023, Zions Bancorporation ZION had an astounding comeback in the third quarter. The company’s shares surged 30%, becoming the top-performing S&amp;P 500 bank.The stock not only comfortably outperformed the industry growth of 7.8% in the three months ended September 2023, but it also substantially outpaced the Zacks Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index.From the chart below, one can clearly see how the ZION stock performed in the third quarter of 2023: Performance in Q3Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZions Witnesses Decisive Trend Reversal in Q3It is a significant turnaround for Zions from earlier this year when the regional banking crisis gripped the markets in March following the collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. The failure of these two banks (and that of First Republic Bank in May) was mainly triggered by deposit flight.During the first half of 2023, ZION shares lost 45.5% in value as investor sentiments toward the regional banks turned bearish. The primary investor concern was exposure to uninsured deposits. Shares of several other notable regional banks, including KeyCorp KEY and Truist Financial TFC, also plunged over similar concerns.Shares of KEY tanked 46.9% and TFC was down 29.5% in the first six months of 2023.With more than 50% of its deposits exceeding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s $250,000 insurable limit before the crisis began, Zions’ shares witnessed unprecedented investor apathy.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock recorded a solid turnaround following the release of its second-quarter 2023 results. After a 3.4% sequential decline in total deposit balance in the first quarter, the company recorded a 7.4% increase in the second quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This solid rebound in deposit balance led to an optimistic stance, with the shares of Zions jumping almost 43% in July only. It is worth noting that this robust deposit performance dented the company’s net interest income (NII) during the quarter as deposit costs jumped.Investors remained uninterested in the higher funding costs and focused on the company’s turnaround story as uninsured deposits as a share of total deposits fell to 41% in the second quarter. This positive investor sentiment continued throughout the third quarter as the ZION management worked toward improving its financials.Story continuesWhat Changed in Q3?At an investor conference in early September, ZION management presented updates for July and August. It showed marked improvement in NII, with July's number being $197 million and August's $199 million. In June, NII was $193 million.Zions also witnessed a 4.8% jump in average deposits in these two months. The metric grew from $72.7 billion in June 2023 to $75.1 billion in July and $76.2 billion in August. The increase was mainly driven by a higher average interest-bearing deposit balance.Likewise, Zions’ net interest margin (NIM) expanded in the first two months of the third quarter. NIM was 2.92% in July and 2.96% in August. The metric was 2.91% in June 2023. This improvement in NIM was despite the rise in total cost of deposits, which rose to 1.8% in July and 1.94% in August from 1.6% in June.These updates showed that Zions will be able to sustain decent NII growth in the third quarter and beyond despite not much change in the operating backdrop over the last couple of months.Further, Zions reiterated its NII outlook. Management projects NII in the second quarter of 2024 to be stable or slightly decline on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, the company plans to reduce its workforce by 3% by 2023-end. While it isn’t clear whether this would include attrition, the reductions are expected to be spread across ZION’s geographic and departmental footprints. The cuts will likely be majorly in roles that do not deal directly with customers or generate revenues.Parting ThoughtsWith the Federal Reserve expected to keep the interest rates high for a longer period, the banking sector will continue facing a tough operating backdrop into the next year. The sector faces ambiguity related to new capital regulations and the path of interest rates. Rising deposit costs, weakening credit quality (largely in commercial real estate) and rating downgrades remain primary headwinds.The reversal witnessed by Zions shows that banks are expected to witness an uphill task to sustain profitability in these unprecedented times.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move demonstrates the bank’s active investment portfolio management strategy.Particularly, the company sold its investment in Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners to a buyer group, including AlpInvest Partners, Atalaya Capital Management, Lexington Partners and Pantheon.WFC was the only institutional limited partner in these funds. Nonetheless, the company will continue its relationship and investments with venture capital and growth equity investment firm, Norwest Venture Partners.Per WFC management, “With this transaction, we are continuing with our strategic efforts to focus on Wells Fargo’s core businesses and customers.”The divestiture of these private equity funds enables the company to explore avenues for growth and profitability by freeing up resources for strategic reallocation. The move comes when lenders have been eyeing opportunities to reduce insignificant bets and improve efficiency as they navigate the uncertain interest-rate scenario.Particularly, in its September meeting, the Federal Reserve held the interest rates steady at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50%, while indicating one more hike before this year's end as “inflation remains elevated.” This marked the second time the central bank kept the rates unchanged since it began raising it effective March 2022.The Fed officials, through the latest dot-plot, indicated that the rates would remain high for a longer period. This dot plot projected a 5.6% Fed funds rate through 2023. For the next year, rates will come down, but not as previously expected. The rates are projected to be down to 5.1%, higher than the 4.6% estimated in June.This shows that the officials are not likely to cut rates as fast as earlier expected. Though the central bank is anticipating a “soft landing,” it will act more aggressively to slash interest rates if the economy tumbles into a recession.Story continuesHence, banks are likely to continue facing a tough operating backdrop next year. Other than macro woes, the asset cap imposed by regulators will limit Wells Fargo’s loan balance. This will, thereby, hamper net interest income growth.Over the past six months, shares of Wells Fargo have gained 7.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 3.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research WFC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The suit claimed that the firms, along with others, manipulated the VIX index in 2018, which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to investment funds that bought options contracts tied to the benchmark.There were claims that the defendants flashed tens of thousands of quotes for out-of-the-money SPX options in February 2018, which were quickly canceled. The defendants were, hence, accused of influencing calculations of the volatility index by Cboe Global Markets, which is the exchange that sets it.Plaintiff Two Roads Shared Trust claimed that its preservation fund had lost $340 million on the day of the incident and then another $180 million when it was forced to close out its options positions at artificial and inflated levels.However, U.S. District Judge Manish S. Shah ruled that accuser LJM Partners Ltd. had not adequately alleged that it was injured. Also, claims by Two Roads Shared Trust are not valid as they were barred by the statute of limitations.MS, Barclays Capital and others have jointly said that the claims by the plaintiffs are false and “fatally flawed.”In a separate filing, Morgan Stanley said that it was improbable that the bank, acting as a market maker, would manipulate the VIX index to benefit an outright proprietary long position and that its revenues on VIX-linked instruments were “from facilitating customer orders during a period of volatility.”So far this year, shares of MS have lost 5.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, no evidence was found that could prove that WFC’s chief executive, Charlie Scharf, and senior diversity executives had knowledge of the sham interviews.The plaintiffs, through the class action suit, had claimed that Wells Fargo had inflated its stock price by issuing a public statement discussing its guidelines mentioning workplace diversity. The said policy was adopted in 2020 and required at least 50% of candidates, who were interviewed for jobs paying at least $100,000, to be minorities, women or people from other disadvantaged groups.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In order to remain profitable amid the high interest rate environment and recession fears, financial institutions are undertaking several restructuring efforts, majorly job cuts.Last month, at an investor conference, Wells Fargo’s WFC CFO, Mike Santomassimo, noted that the company was eyeing opportunities to cut down expenses by reducing its real estate footprint and headcount.Santomassimo stated, “We continue to believe we’ve got a lot more to do to make the company as efficient as it should be.”Since third-quarter 2020, WFC has cut almost 40,000 jobs. Santomassimo added, “We had too much real estate before Covid, and so we’ve been methodically working through that portfolio over the last few years.”In August, Charles Schwab SCHW announced a business streamlining plan as part of its cost-saving measures.

213,9941b205-0c65-330f-a33d-6b7e16b54b76,PYPL,2023-10-04,Is Paypal (PYPL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-buy-wall-street-133006195.html,1696339806,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Paypal (PYPL).Paypal currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.78, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 32 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.78 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 32 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.4% and 3.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PYPLBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PYPLCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Paypal here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Paypal, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PYPL a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Paypal, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.95.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Paypal.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During an appearance at Fortune’s CEO Initiative conference in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said it was a misconception that increases in productivity have to lead to job losses.“People mistake productivity with job displacement,” Krishna said onstage.He noted that, as IBM phased out a few hundred back-office HR roles over three to four years, as it added headcount in software engineering and sales roles. “The increase was like 8,000,” Krishna said. “The decrease was like 800.”Krishna specified that employees weren’t let go as a result of this transition—rather, certain roles were not backfilled when they opened up.But there's no question that “repetitive white-collar jobs” will be affected by the technology, Krishna said, echoing a point he has raised in the past.“The first thing you can automate is a repetitive, white-collar job,” he said on Tuesday. But while AI could take over 10% to 20% of “lower level tasks,” he predicted it wouldn’t take a person’s job altogether, because no one’s job is composed entirely of these sorts of tasks, he says. He expects his programmers to get 30% more productive thanks to the technology. “I don’t intend to get rid of a single one,” he said. “I’ll get more.”All of which is a boon for developed countries, where Krishna sees an ongoing labor shortage in the coming years. During his onstage interview at the CEO Initiative, Krishna drew a contrast between the scarce labor market in the developed world, which will be in dire need of supercharging productivity, and the developing world, which will have lots of ready and willing workers to fill open jobs. That’s similar to a point he made in a May interview with CNBC, saying successful implementation of AI was critical to maintaining the current quality of life the developing world enjoys.Story continues“Population is flat or, in the worst case, declining,” Krishna said at the time. “So you need to get productivity, otherwise, quality of life is going to fall. And AI is the only answer we got.”The increase in productivity will allow companies like IBM to hire more people, not fewer, because it will allow them to produce more goods and services, which will then need to be taken to market. He gave the example of the rise of the smartphone, which unexpectedly created a booming market for software designers. “In 1995 no one thought there would be five million web designers—there are,” Krishna said. His fellow panelist, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, gave the example of Uber, which created an entirely new use for the smartphone that hadn’t been previously considered but became rather ubiquitous in consumers’ lives.At IBM, AI has already been integrated into some of the company’s most critical work. About three-quarters of chip design at the company is done by AI, according to Krishna. In July, Reuters reported that IBM was considering using its own chips to power its cloud computing service to lower costs.‘China is advanced in AI, let’s not have any illusions about that’The conversation then veered toward another hot-button issue in AI: the ongoing arms race with China.“China is advanced in AI,” Krishna said. “Let’s not have any illusions about that.”Although Krishna’s view, which he called a “little bit contrarian,” is that the U.S. is leading in AI, the size of that lead is debatable, he said: “Is the U.S. six months ahead or two years ahead?”China does have some advantages compared to the U.S.—most notably, a government comfortable issuing dictats on AI development in order to support its own aims. China, Krishna says, has the “ability to use large private datasets,” something U.S. firms can’t do because of privacy and other laws. The government in China is also more open to exploring uses of A.I. the U.S. might consider undemocratic. All of which will result in a fracturing for the application of AI. “As there’s more and more of a tech war, there’s going to be more and more of a development that’s splintered across the two nations,” Krishna said.Amon, who noted that the U.S. remains the global leader in chip design, predicted that the U.S. could become the dominant force in AI and all the tangential industries needed to support its development.“The most important thing we can do is make sure the US remains the number one place to attract talent because there’s a finite number of individuals that can help create AI and those technologies,” he said.Krishna then reminded the audience that the U.S. has been the cradle of AI technology. “[That] generative AI came out of places like Stanford, MIT, Google, and Facebook is a fact that I think we should all take pride in.”IBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Last month, IBM announced a commitment to train two million learners in AI by the end of 2026, with a focus on underrepresented communities. And, through IBM SkillsBuild's collaboration with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, we are providing free education and career readiness resources to Hispanics nationwide. Through this collaboration, Hispanic learners are also earning IBM-branded digital credentials that are recognized by the market to create direct pathways to tech jobs.We are inspired by stories from learners like Oscar Ramirez, an immigrant from Mexico who has studied AI and many more courses through IBM SkillsBuild on his path to a career in technology.Oscar arrived in California from Mexico when he was five. ""We left because of rising crime and the lack of educational resources,"" he shared. For years Oscar had no official status in the US, but eventually had the opportunity to apply for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which allowed him to work and pursue college.Growing up in Silicon Valley, it was almost inevitable that Oscar would be drawn to the world of technology. His family couldn't afford a computer, so they frequented the local library to learn and experiment with computers, ultimately leading him to choose computer science as his major in college. To afford education, Oscar had to work full-time while also attending college full-time since he couldn't access student loans due to his immigration status. It was a demanding path, filled with major life changes, but his determination paid off when he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics from San Jose State University in June 2023.During his last semester of college, Oscar was introduced to IBM SkillsBuild through the Hispanic Heritage Foundation (via the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers). He started taking courses and earning credentials, to better stand out for a great role in a great company.Story continues""I've taken many IBM SkillsBuild courses and credentials, including AI fundamentals, Cybersecurity, Web Development, Data Analysis, Project Management, and more. What I liked most about the program is that it centralizes a lot of important information and allows you to learn in-depth about the things that most interest you. I like that I can do this as fast or as slow as I want and, in the end, you can have an official way to show people what you've been spending your time doing. I enjoyed going through the learning modules which allow me to distinguish myself as a great candidate for any employer.""As a generalist with a wide range of interests, IBM SkillsBuild's career assessment tool helped him identify areas where he could excel and allowed him to dig deeper into learning paths that matched his interests and skills.For peers considering embarking on the IBM SkillsBuild journey, Oscar offers some advice: ""If there's anything that you'd be interested in doing that IBM SkillsBuild can offer, take the first step, and start with the courses. It'll paint a clearer picture of what you need to do to get where you want to be.""Oscar's story is a testament to the power of determination, hard work, and the opportunities that programs like IBM SkillsBuild can provide. Oscar has transformed his life from being an immigrant with limited resources to someone who's actively shaping their future in the tech industry.""We are at an inflection point in the development of technology. AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, and it is important that we ensure that Latinos have the opportunity to participate and become a part of the next generation in technology. That way can ensure that this technology is being used and developed in a way that benefits all people.""To learn more about IBM SkillsBuild and AI skills, visit ibmskillsbuild.orgView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/789617/ibm-celebrates-hispanic-heritage-month-empowering-learners-like-oscar-ramirez-for-a-future-in-tech-through-ibm-skillsbuild]"

218,a7d93478-2042-34a1-bd16-771724b31375,MPC,2023-10-04,5 Energy Stocks That Crushed the S&P 500 in a Bleak Q3,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-energy-stocks-crushed-p-134300363.html,1696340580,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'VLO', 'PSX', 'HAL', 'MPC']","[The third quarter of 2023 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 4% in what was brought about by a severe setback consecutively in August and September.Market participants expressed significant worry as the Fed warned of an additional 25 basis point rate hike before the year-end, indicating a prolonged period of higher interest rates to fight the stubborn inflation. Consequently, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s first quarterly loss of 2023, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with oil prices within spitting distance of the $100-a-barrel threshold and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the July-September period. The standout performers of the third quarter were Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Halliburton HAL, Valero Energy VLO and APA Corporation APA.Energy Stands Tall Amid Broad-Based DeclineAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the quarter in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while most others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index generated a total return of 11.3% in the third quarter against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 3.7%.Much of this can be attributed to Saudi Arabia's June declaration of a unilateral reduction in oil output by 1 million barrels per day. This production cut, initially extended through August and September and subsequently continued for the rest of 2023, has served as the primary driver of the increase in oil prices.In addition to Riyadh's efforts, recent data from the Energy Information Administration revealed a significant decrease in U.S. commercial crude inventories. Since July, these inventories have fallen by almost 42 million barrels. To put that in context, total domestic stock now stands at 416.3 million barrels — 3.3% less than the year-ago figure and 4% less than the five-year average.Furthermore, supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) have now dropped to 22 million barrels — the lowest since July 2022.In response, WTI oil prices topped $95 last week for its highest intraday level since August of last year. While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have more than offset the tightening supply outlook.Most energy investors have had something to cheer about in the September quarter, but some stocks certainly performed better than others. The five largest contributors to the quarterly sectoral gains were Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Halliburton, Valero Energy and APA Corporation.Will these winners maintain their run in the last quarter of 2023, too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to a lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC handily outperformed all but one stock and was up 29.8% during the period, ranking second on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Marathon continues to generate strong cash flows amid a disciplined capital strategy and increasing shareholder returns, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) downstream operator’s further price gains could be limited by operational issues and an unpredictable refining macro backdrop.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Phillips 66: Another major refiner in terms of size, efficiency and strength, Phillips 66 buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Phillips 66, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 26% last quarter. With its vast pipeline network, the company is also a big player in the midstream business, generating stable fee-based revenues. Higher commodity prices have driven upstream investments, thereby increasing volumes for midstream operators. However, due to lower demand for refined petroleum products, the firm might miss the potential gain in refining margins. Thus, Phillips 66 is likely to witness a decrease in its total capacity utilizations. Hence, we expect pre-tax income from refining business to be lower this year.Halliburton: It is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors. Halliburton operates in over 80 countries. Founded in 1919, Halliburton employs more than 40,000 people and operates under two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 22.8% in the past quarter. But it will be a bumpy ride in the near-to-medium term. While the company’s significant global presence exposes it to worldwide geopolitical risks, the rapidly rising labor and material costs are cutting margins. Finally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) energy company’s above-average debt-to-capitalization and low dividend yield are other negatives in the HAL story.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 20.8% higher in the last three-month period. The Gulf Coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero is expected to capitalize on the rising demand for distillate fuel. However, there are concerns about Valero’s high debt levels, which leave it vulnerable to any volatility in commodity prices. Also, higher oil and gas prices can lead to increased input costs for Valero, thereby putting pressure on the profit margins. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential VLO.APA Corporation: It is one of the world's leading independent energy firms engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Geographically, the company’s operations are in the United States, Egypt and the North Sea of the United Kingdom. APA also holds acreage in offshore Suriname (South America) and other international locations.This stock, with a Zacks Rank of 3, ended 20.3% higher in the July-September period. APA’s slew of discoveries in offshore Suriname, through its joint venture with TotalEnergies, is a major positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Suriname is expected to become one of APA’s major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the company's high leverage restricts its financial flexibility. Moreover, APA’s significant exposure to forex currency and the associated risks might put off some investors.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Acceleration Plan, designed to build upon the Company’s growth in the years ahead, was shared at the Company’s 2023 Strategy Day in New York City.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231003616121/en/""Getting to growth was the focus of our 2019 Revitalization Plan, and as a result of three plus years of work we are on track to deliver our second straight year of top and bottom-line growth,"" said Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Over the past few years, long before controversy upended the U.S. beer industry, we changed how we invest, market, and operate, and we changed our future.

The Company has aggressively premiumized its portfolio, in both Beer and Beyond Beer, to meaningfully change the shape of its product portfolio. With the benefit of major innovation successes, including Madri in the U.K. and Simply Spiked in North America, the Company has increased its Net Sales Revenue from its Above Premium portfolio from 23% in 2019 to 28% in 2022. Building on this strength along with compelling new innovations, particularly in Beyond Beer, the Company’s goal is for its Above Premium portfolio to reach approximately one-third of its Net Sales Revenue excluding contract brewing, factored and distributor owned brands in the medium term.Scale and expand in beyond beer. The Company’s Beyond Beer portfolio includes Flavor, Spirits, and Non-Alcoholic. This Beyond Beer portfolio supports the Company’s premiumization efforts and is focused on scalable products in higher-growth segments. From diversified flavor, including winners like Simply Spiked and Arnold Palmer Spiked, to acclaimed whiskey brands under the Coors Spirits Company, to energy drinks through its partnership with Dwayne Johnson’s ZOA Energy, the Company expects its Beyond Beer portfolio to drive about half of its Above Premium net sales revenue growth over the medium term.Invest in its capabilities.

Since 2019, the Company increased aluminum can production capacity, built a new U.S. variety packer, added a can line in Croatia, built a new state-of-the-art brewery in Canada, broke ground on a major modernization in its Golden Colorado brewery, and added flavor production capabilities in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. The Company’s digital transformation has enhanced the effectiveness of its marketing and sales efforts as well.

In addition, statements that we make in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may also be forward-looking statements.Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience, and present projections and expectations are disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). These factors include, among other things, the deterioration of general economic, political, credit and/or capital market conditions; our dependence on the global supply chain and significant exposure to changes in commodity and other input prices and the impacts of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures; weak, or weakening of, economic, social and other conditions in the markets in which we do business; loss, operational disruptions or closure of a major brewery or other key facility; cybersecurity incidents impacting our information systems, and violations of data privacy laws and regulations; our reliance on brand image, reputation, product quality and protection of intellectual property; constant evolution of the global beer industry and the broader alcohol industry, and our position within the global beer industry and success of our product in our markets; competition in our markets; our ability to successfully and timely innovate beyond beer; changes in the social acceptability, perceptions and the political view of the beverage categories in which we operate; labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues; ESG issues; climate change and other weather events; inadequate supply or availability of quality water; our dependence on key personnel; our reliance on third party service providers and internal and outsourced systems; impacts related to the coronavirus pandemic; our significant debt level subjects us to financial and operating risks, and the agreements governing such debt, which subject us to financial and operating covenants and restrictions; deterioration in our credit rating; impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets; the estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate; our reliance on a small number of suppliers to obtain the input materials we need to operate our business; termination or changes of one or more manufacturer, distribution or production agreements, or issues caused by our dependence on the parties to these agreements; unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters; our operations in developing and emerging markets; changes to the regulation of the distribution systems for our products; our consolidated financial statements are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations; risks associated with operating our joint ventures; failure to successfully identify, complete or integrate attractive acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations; and other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements in this press release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by reference to the underlying assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.NON-GAAP MEASURESIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), we also use non-GAAP financial measures, as listed and defined below, for operational and financial decision making and to assess Company and segment business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. We have provided reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure.Our management uses these metrics to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. We believe these measures are used by, and are useful to, investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance.Underlying Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Closest GAAP Metric: Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s income (loss) before income taxes excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. Non-GAAP adjustment items include goodwill and other intangible and tangible asset impairments, restructuring and integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, potential or incurred losses related to certain litigation accruals and settlements and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, among other items included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective, involve significant management judgment and can vary substantially from company to company.Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC) – Measure of net income (loss) attributable to MCBC excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above), the related tax effects of non-GAAP adjustment items and certain other discrete tax items.Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share (also referred to as Underlying Earnings per Share) (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share) – Measure of underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (as defined above) per diluted share. If applicable, a reported net loss attributable to MCBC per diluted share is calculated using the basic share count due to dilutive shares being antidilutive. If underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC becomes income excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustment items, we include the incremental dilutive shares, using the treasury stock method, into the dilutive shares outstanding.Net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""Underlying EBITDA"") (Closest GAAP Metrics: Cash, Debt, &amp; Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s leverage calculated as Net debt (defined as current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the trailing twelve month underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBITDA is calculated as Net Income (Loss) excluding Interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). This measure is not the same as the Company’s maximum leverage ratio as defined under its revolving credit facility, which allows for other adjustments in the calculation of net debt to EBITDA.Constant currency – Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized to measure performance, excluding the impact of translational and certain transactional foreign currency movements, and is intended to be indicative of results in local currency. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. The percentage changes for net sales and underlying income (loss) before income taxes in constant currency consider the impact of foreign exchange by translating the current period local currency results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current period results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior year period. Additionally, any transactional foreign currency impacts, reported within the other non-operating income (expense), net line item, are excluded from our current period results.Our guidance for any of the measures noted above are also non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. When we provide guidance for any of the various non-GAAP metrics described above, we do not provide reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures as we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of the non-GAAP adjustment items. By their very nature, non-GAAP adjustment items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable efforts.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231003616121/en/ContactsInvestor Relations:Greg Tierney(414) 931-3303Traci Mangini(415) 308-0151News Media: Rachel Dickens(314) 452-9673]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Molson Coors Brewing is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Diageo has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that TAP has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.TAP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.38, while DEO has a forward P/E of 17.94. We also note that TAP has a PEG ratio of 1.70. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. DEO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.45.Another notable valuation metric for TAP is its P/B ratio of 1.02. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, DEO has a P/B of 8.09.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help TAP earn a Value grade of A, while DEO has been given a Value grade of C.TAP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that TAP is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a result of walkouts, more than 6,000 workers from GM, Ford and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) and their suppliers lost their jobs. On September 15th when the strike kicked off, Ford laid off 600 workers. On Monday, Ford announced the furloughs of another 330 workers. The unprecedented strike will make the EV transition of General Motors and Ford Motor even more challenging. Making EVs is on its own much more challenging as this is everything but an easy journey Even the EV startup Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) who brought the world’s first electric pickup to the road had to lay off 6% of its workforce which comes to about 840 workers back in February. Rivian is still struggling to reach profitability and supply chain issues made things even more challenging. This was the second round of layoffs Rivian as it struggled with the price war that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) kicked off. It seems that Rivian did succeed in improving its operational efficiency as it topped estimates with Q3 deliveries, unlike Tesla who fell short of expectations.Story continuesGamingAt the end of September, Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, announced it will be trimming 16% of its workforce or more precisely 830 employees in order to stabilize its finances.NetworkingEarlier in September, Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) joined the redundancy train as it announced it will be laying off 350 employees this month.StreamingAt the beginning of September, Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU) announced it will be trimming its workforce by 10%. Roku's second round of 2023 layoffs will affect 300 people, adding to the 200 it dismissed in March and 200 redundancies from 2022. The trend is also present in music streaming with Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT) ended its trend of spending heavily to expand its podcast empire. Things changed at Spotify dramatically when 2023 kicked off with restructuring under which content chief Dawn Ostroff left the company and Salesforce announced a 6% reduction of its workforce. It followed up its January layoff plans in June by cutting 200 podcast department jobs.Social MediaOn September 27th, Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) decided to make cuts at its AR Enterprise by slashing about 170 job posts. Snap conducted two rounds of job cuts in just over a year as last August, it laid off 1,280 employees which made about 20% of its workforce. Snap continues to work towards sustainable profitability as it focuses on core advertising.Apple Is The Last Tech Firm Standing As It Continues To Resist The Layoffs TrendApple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) continues to contrast tech redundancies. Only a day after Epic Games revealed its newest job cuts, Apple announced it is hiring. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated on several occasions that layoffs are the last resort. But even Apple is conducting cost-cutting initiatives such as putting a lid on spending. Analysts find that the reason why Apple hasn’t been dragged in the mass layoffs trends is because it hired more efficiently during the pandemic. All in all, with or without generative AI investment, layoffs certainly tell the story of management’s stewardship of shareholder dollars and Apple is reaping the reward for being cautious with hiring during the pandemic-fueled hiring binge, unlike its tech peers, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

FoleyGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to join you today for my first earnings call as President and CEO. Just over 1 month into my new role, I am energized by our underlying business trends, which reinforce our competitive advantages and differentiation. Let's turn to our results. We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Our results were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding challenges for our Consumer segment in Asia Pacific or APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery has been slower than previously anticipated. Let me start with the highlights for the third quarter. We delivered solid constant currency sales growth. We continue to realize effective price realization, and importantly, volume performance, excluding China, has improved each quarter throughout the year. We continue to see top line momentum in our business positioning McCormick for sustained growth. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Year-to-date cash flow from operations more than doubled relative to the prior year due to higher operating income and working capital improvements. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our business fundamentals and the effective execution of our proven strategies, while leveraging the sustained demand for Flavor. Turning to Slide 5. In the third quarter, we drove 6% sales growth in constant currency, demonstrating the strength of our broad global portfolio. Our constant currency growth reflected strong business performance, with an 8% contribution from pricing and a 2% decline in volume and product mix. This decline in volume was driven by 2 factors: a 1% volume decline attributable to the impact of a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China; and a 1% decline related to the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia and the pruning of low-margin business to optimize our portfolio. All other underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 1%. I would like to now share a few highlights on gross margin and operating income for the quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail. We drove strong gross margin improvement year-over-year, reflecting continued recovery of the cost inflation, our pricing lagged last year and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. We remain focused on improving our margins over the long term and believe that our recovery will be a continuous build. And we expect to return to historical levels and believe there is a runway beyond that, recognizing it will take some time. Higher gross profit for the quarter was partially offset by lower-than-expected performance in China as well as higher SG&amp;A. As planned, we continue to build back incentive compensation and increased brand marketing investments. The net impact was a 5% increase in adjusted operating income versus the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results year-to-date. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our focused approach to optimizing our cost structure, reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory during the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving into the fourth quarter, we can continue to expect top line momentum across our portfolio, including growth in China as we lap the COVID-related disruptions. China's growth, however, is expected to be less than originally anticipated, which when combined with its year-to-date performance, has led to a lower full year 2023 benefit than we originally expected. Despite this impact, however, we are reaffirming our sales outlook, and now anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range. We are reaffirming our operating income outlook, which highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our business, excluding China. Demand is strong. We are driving improvement in our margin profile and are optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now for our performance by segment. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 7. We saw solid results across the Americas and EMEA, which were tempered by our APAC region due to China, as I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding China, we are pleased with our underlying performance. Now for some highlights by regions. First, in the Americas. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew approximately 4%, excluding the year-over-year impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of DSD, direct store delivery of our bagged Hispanic spices. There is a minor difference between our sales and consumption, which is attributable to listing fees for a significant increase in new distribution and new products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions. Importantly, our categories remain advantaged in terms of growth relative to overall macro trends, and we are well positioned to drive future growth. The fundamental strength of the spices and seasonings category is evident as cooking at home has remained elevated since pre-COVID and consumers have an increasing demand for flavor. U.S. spices and seasonings growth is continuing to outpace the total edible category in units and dollars. We have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions to grow market share in this very attractive and competitive category. We have made progress and shown improvement relative to the beginning of the year. We continue to restore distribution, which was lost because of supply issues. As we look at our performance and our trends, we are happy to see total distribution point growth in the third quarter. We also continue to be pleased that our assortment on shelf is more productive than pre-COVID. In addition, we have significant new distribution and innovation that is starting to come online as customers reset their shelves. As we said before, restoration will take some time, and we expect to drive growth as we continue to progress. In addition to driving distribution gains, we have a continued focus on supporting our brands and optimizing pricing. As you would expect, this has become a more important part of our category management efforts in recent years. Our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. Our efforts are yielding results. The renovation of our U.S. core Everyday Spice and Herb portfolio is rolling out according to plan. At the end of the third quarter, we have shipped about 40% of our renovated SKUs, and notably, products that have transitioned on shelf have seen high teens improvement in velocity, and our significant brand marketing campaign featuring the benefits of the new packaging ramped up at the end of the third quarter leading into the holiday season. Our larger-sized Super Deal herbs and spices continues to gain share. We saw strong performance in the third quarter driven by pricing and higher unit volume. Expanded distribution has been a major driver for our performance as well as consumers that are seeking value and trading up to larger sizes. We have the right assortment in this environment. Our household penetration on larger sizes is greater than pre-COVID. We are confident this product line will continue to drive growth as we expand distribution further and launch new line extensions. Our grilling performance was strong this quarter, supported by our Fire Up campaign as well as contribution for new product launches that we discussed on our earnings call in June. Frank's RedHot sauces, French's mustard and Stubb's Bar-B-Q sauce rubs as well as Lawry's marinades all delivered significant growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year. We drove double-digit sales growth with contributions from pricing and volume across our total growing portfolio. And we drove market share gains in mustard, barbecue sauce and marinades in the third quarter. Our expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with new Cholula Taco recipe mixes and salsas is continuing to build distribution and performance to date is outperforming our expectations. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce, led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products. Turning to EMEA, where we delivered a great quarter, our strongest quarterly sales performance in more than 2 years with double-digit sales growth. Notably, in the U.K. and France, we drove volume growth as pricing remained elevated. In both countries, we delivered significant growth in the discount channel, driven by expanded distribution with new and existing customers. In other parts of the region, we are also making meaningful progress in this fast-growing channel. We grew our business in the discount channel by over 30% across EMEA in the third quarter. Our grilling activations with key retailers in France and our promotional activities in the U.K., along with brand marketing support, drove strong third quarter growth across the growing portfolio. E-commerce also contributed meaningfully to our growth in both countries. Consumption data continues to indicate that the consumer is holding up well in our categories with consumption trends continuing to accelerate across the region. We grew share in herbs, spices and seasonings for our total EMEA business, with the U.K., Eastern Europe, Italy and France all contributing. France grew share for the first time in 2 years. And U.K. recipe mixes, we extended our leading share position during the third quarter. New products and effective in-store promotions drove share gains. We also continue to drive hot sauce category growth in the U.K. with Cholula leading to growth in the third quarter. And we are also building distribution of Cholula in France. In our APAC region, while the pace of recovery in this business has been slower than expected, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Notwithstanding the slower recovery in China, in all regions in our Consumer segment, our investments in brand marketing, category management initiatives and new products are proving to be effective and driving strong growth across our categories. We are making sequential improvement on volume, advancing our heat platform and are pleased with our performance. We continue to fuel our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. We are also forming strategic partnerships to reach and enhance brand awareness with loyal built in audiences. Building on the success we have with our Tabitha Brown partnership in light of new products in the U.S., where growth continues to accelerate, we are partnering with Nadiya Hussain, a celebrity British chef, who won the sixth series of BBC's, The Great British Bake Off in EMEA. We are launching a delicious range of Schwartz seasonings, recipe mixes and meal kits with Nadiya, and are helping build the confidence of U.K. consumers in the kitchen with cook-along videos and recipe ideas. We are thrilled to partner with Nadiya, and preliminary results are very positive. We are looking forward to working with her on various future initiatives across the region to expand our brand awareness and accelerate new product growth. Our brand marketing efforts continue to drive awareness and strengthen our brands. As you may have seen in July, we partnered with Mars and launched a limited edition, French's mustard-flavored SKITTLES. The objective of the campaign was to create top-of-mind awareness for French's through a buzz-worthy moment to further strengthen the power of our brand. And of course, you could always have fun with mustard. We are thrilled that this was our most successful earned campaign to date with a record 5 billion impressions. It is also a perfect example of how we leverage our strengths across both segments, underscoring their complementary nature. Our Flavor Solutions team created the mustard flavor for this limited edition product which builds awareness for both our consumer and foodservice businesses. Our segments are working together to further bolster French's success. I am passionate about how our 2 segments: Consumer and Flavor Solutions complement each other, reinforcing what differentiates McCormick and enabling us to drive sustainable growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season and our related brand marketing plans across all regions. Importantly, with our supply issues resolved, we are better positioned than we were last year entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels to one, similar to pre-COVID, and are supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns across all regions. We are expecting a strong holiday season. Wrapping up the consumer update. Our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past. The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved, and we are using our strength in category management, to increase distribution, and drive McCormick and category growth. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which differentiates us even more and strengthening our leadership in our core categories. Now turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our growth momentum in this segment continues to be exceptional. The third quarter marks our 10th consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all 3 regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last 2 years. We remain committed to restoring our Flavor Solutions profitability. And in the third quarter, we again drove significant margin expansion versus prior year and expect continued progress toward our objective to build back our margin in this segment. Let me turn to our highlights by region. Our Americas third quarter strong sales growth was led by pricing with an increase in volume contributing as well. Both the Flavors and branded foodservice product categories grew by double digits. With Flavors, our seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products. We are helping our customers grow with the strength of our brands. Our continued success with providing the seasonings for co-branded items included new ones with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's this quarter contributed to our growth. Strength in our customers' iconic products also contributed to our seasonings growth, particularly related to our heat platform. We also have strong momentum in Flavors for performance nutrition beverages and health end market applications. Our growth is outpacing the market, fueled by the advantages of our proprietary technologies. Importantly, we are winning with new products for existing and new customers, largely across our mid-market customer base who are category leaders in specific markets or high-growth innovators and whose growth is outpacing larger customers. We continue to have a robust pipeline of new products and our conversion rate is strong. We are creating preferred flavors, enabling our customers to continue to win in the marketplace. In branded foodservice, we gained share in spices and seasonings this quarter. Additionally, our recent new products, Frank's Mild Sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot Seasoning are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. They have both been well received by our customers, reinforcing that the demand for heat is growing at both the mild and hot end of the spectrum. We are excited for continued growth in these items as well as the overall breadth of opportunity in heat. Moving to EMEA. We continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio, with strong growth in both our quick service restaurant and packaged food and beverage customers. Pricing drove the growth as some of our customers in both channels continue to experience softness in the volume within their own businesses. As we continue to prune low-margin business in our Flavor Solutions segment, while it did not impact the third quarter, I want to mention that we divested a small canning business, which was part of our Giotti operations in Italy. This divestiture allows us to focus our resources on our core Flavors product category and drive further growth. Mike will have more in the future impact of this divestiture on the EMEA region in a few minutes. And in APAC, while the economic recovery in China was not as strong as anticipated, China contributed to the regional pricing and volume growth. Across the region, we benefited from our QSR customers increase in promotional activity. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary inspired innovation are driving outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum. Our Flavors product category are 100% focus on flavor, our breadth and reach, our unrivaled consumer insights and our proprietary technology platform gives us an advantage and positions us well to continue to win in the technically insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, driving growth and advancing our Flavor leadership. And in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, culinary partnerships and our expertise in heat to drive continued growth. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions and effective execution of our proven strategies bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our Flavor Solutions leadership as well as margin restoration. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.Michael R. SmithThanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top line constant currency sales growth grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting 8% from pricing, partially offset with a 2% volume and mix decline. As Brendan already mentioned, there were impacts to volume related to the slower-than-expected recovery in the China consumer business, the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our consumer business in Russia and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the portfolio -- profitability of our portfolio. As a result, at the total company level, excluding these items, underlying volume performance was flat for the quarter and improved sequentially from the second quarter. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased by 1%, reflecting a 5% increase in pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline. Included in this volume decline are a 2% decline due to a lower-than-expected recovery in China, and a 2% decline attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture, our business exit in Russia, and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency and included a 4% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 2% volume decline due to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and DSD items I just mentioned. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales increased 10% with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline primarily from exiting Russia. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all markets and categories. Constant currency consumer sales in the APAC region decreased 11% driven by a 15% volume decrease, primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Also contributing to the decline was the impact of lapping strong China demand in the prior year following significant extended lockdowns during the second quarter of last year. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 11%, reflecting a 10% increase from pricing and a 1% increase from volume and product mix. Our volume growth was partially offset by the pruning of low-margin business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 10%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing and a 1% volume and product mix growth. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio, with strength in Flavors, including seasonings and specialty flavors as well as branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% impact from exiting the private label product line mentioned earlier. Outside of this product discontinuation, volumes declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses. Regarding the divestiture of the Giotti [canning] business, Brendan mentioned earlier. We expect this divestiture to impact EMEA Flavor Solutions by approximately 3% starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. For the total Flavor Solutions segment, we expect an approximately 1% impact, and for the total company, less than 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 13% in constant currency with a 7% contribution pricing and 6% volume growth, driven by our customers' promotional activities and limited time offers across the region. As seen on Slide 21, gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points in the third quarter versus the year ago period, reflecting our steadfast focus on increasing profit realization. Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs and the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the past 2 years. We expect to finish 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter. Historically, our quarter gross margin has been higher than the second quarter. This year, however, they were comparable at approximately 37% because we realized our highest level of both pricing and cost recovery from prior years in the second quarter. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year, and as evidenced by our full year outlook and year-to-date results, we expect a higher gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year as well as expansion from the fourth quarter of 2022. Now moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&amp;A, increased relative to the third quarter of last year. As higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution cost were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the third quarter of last year, and we continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing for the full year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A increased 160 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&amp;A cost resulted in constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment, which was impacted by the slower China recovery and brand marketing investments declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income increased 42%. Turning to interest expense and the income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the third quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4% compared to 21.2% in the year ago period. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with the McCormick branded mayonnaise, marmalades and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 as compared to $0.69 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven by lapping a favorable impact primarily related to an optimization of our debt portfolio included in other income in the third quarter of last year. This impact is also a headwind to our full year results. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was very strong, $660 million in 2023 compared to $250 million for the same period last year, a 164% increase. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $314 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $187 million of cash for capital expenditures through the third quarter. We expect 2023 to be a very strong year of cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 year-to-date cash flow from operations of $660 million, which is already slightly higher than our full year cash flow in 2022. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends, and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With our improving gross margin and lower inventory, we are well positioned to continue paying down debt, and we now expect to deleverage to approximately 3x earlier in 2024 than we originally expected. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization, we expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth. Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also anticipate minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact year-to-date through the third quarter, and project a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our sales and operating profit outlook for 2023 despite a slower recovery in China. We no longer expect a 1% contribution to our sales from lapping last year's COVID disruptions in China. And we are also revising the benefit from a China recovery to our operating income from 300 basis points to 100 basis points. At the top line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, and anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range given the lower-than-expected China recovery. The wrap of last year's pricing actions as well as the impact of new ones in '23 are the primary drivers of growth. Several factors are expected to impact our volume and product mix for the year, including price elasticities which are consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. The continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio. We continue to estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA's Flavor Solutions private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter of 2023. And finally, the divestiture of Giotti's canning business, which closed on the first day of the fourth quarter, will have a minimal impact on total company sales for the year. We continue to plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 110 to 140 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 50 to 100 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. It also reflects more than offsetting cost pressures with pricing actions as we recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last 2 years. Moving to adjusted operating income. We continue to expect 10% to 12% constant currency growth. There were some discrete items expected to impact our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, remaining consistent with our prior outlook, we expect our GOE program to have an 800 basis point favorable impact and the Kitchen Basics divestiture to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. Next, I already mentioned the expected 100 basis point benefit related to China, which is lower than the originally anticipated 300 basis points. Finally, we expect a 900 basis point unfavorable impact from building back incentive compensation, slightly ahead of our prior projection of 800 basis points given the increase in earnings expectations since the beginning of the year. The net impact of these discrete items is an unfavorable 100 basis points as compared to a 200 basis point favorable impact in our previous outlook. The reaffirmation of our adjusted operating income outlook despite the unfavorable change in the impact from discrete items, highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our underlying business, which is now expected to be 11% to 13% growth compared to 8% to 10% growth previously. We are reaffirming our low single-digit increases in brand marketing investments, our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million, our interest expense outlook of an estimated range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22%. We are increasing our income from unconsolidated operations projection to a 30% expected increase from 2022 reflecting the strong performance we expect in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 14% to 16%, above our prior projection of 10% to 12%. Combining this 14% to 16% underlying growth with a 1% unfavorable impact from the discrete items on adjusted operating profit and the combined interest and tax headwind of 9% resulted in an expected increase of 4% to 6% or projected guidance range of adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.62 to $2.67. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion and strong cash flow. We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 financial outlook.Brendan M. FoleyThank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&amp;A, I would like to provide some closing comments. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories.Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, trusted brands, increased digital engagement and purpose-minded practices continue to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are end-to-end flavor for our consumers and customers. We remain a different kind of CPG company, one differentiated by our growth platform, the results that we have achieved over the last years and our culture. We play in great and fast-growing categories. Our 2 segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions complement each other, reinforcing our differentiation. The scale, insights and technology that we leverage from both segments are meaningful in driving sustainable growth. We continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to drive success. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide as their energy and excitement for the business is coming through in our results. Now to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 30. Our third quarter performance was strong, reflecting sustained demand and the effective execution of our growth strategies and our volume performance, excluding China, continued to improve. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our year-to-date cash flow from operation results was strong, already equal to our full year 2022 results. Our reaffirmed sales and operating profit guidance, despite lower-than-expected China recovery highlights the growing strength of the rest of the business. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and execution of our proven strategies bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory over the long term. Now for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.Andrew LazarI guess maybe to start off with McCormick, obviously, as you mentioned, saw some sequential volume improvement in Consumer Americas in the fiscal third quarter, and you're lapping an easier -- and even easier, I guess, down 11 volume decline in the year ago period in the fourth quarter. So I guess my question is, would you expect volume in the Consumer Americas segment to flip positively in the fourth quarter? And if not, I guess, what would be the key factors that would keep you from doing so, obviously, all in the context of an industry volume backdrop that remains kind of subdued?Brendan M. FoleyWell, thanks, Andrew, for your question. Just to maybe speak first to last year's fourth quarter. I think our sales growth back in 2022 was down about 1.7% take on sales. And that was without Kitchen Basics. And we were lapping the 2021 retail inventory build. At a high level, I think we -- as we talked about on that call, entered the 2022 holiday with just -- a lot stronger inventory than we have -- we're counting on or predicting or forecasting. So the way we're looking at it is the net sales impact really was up about -- a little over 4% in the fourth quarter last year. So we're not seeing that necessarily as an easy comparison overall. But just talking to dollars first. That's kind of our view is just we're still looking at a pretty robust fourth quarter from a year ago, just knowing that we had that comparison in the fourth quarter. Now when you look at this year's fourth quarter, as we said on the call here earlier, you will see the impact of that DSD continuation in our Hispanic bag spices part of our business. It just tends to be -- that business tends to be heavier in the fourth quarter because of the holiday. So that will be a little bit stronger than -- but to our spices and seasonings business, we continue to see improving trends in that part of our portfolio. And you should expect to see that in the fourth quarter, that sequential improvement in performance overall. And we feel like we're going to have a strong holiday. I mean I think the reasons why we feel good about the direction of that part of our portfolio is, and you heard it on the call, we're gaining share and we're gaining distribution on Super Deal herbs and spices. On the Lawry's opening price point platform, we're still getting really good performance for that, but still also building out distribution. And we have one value retailer that we've only begun just starting shipments on, and we'll start to build out and fill out more store locations because we have like just in that one particular account, 85% of the locations still yet to come. So we still see distribution build happening behind Lawry's overall. And that renovation that we launched here this year, we talked about in the second quarter is doing really well, where we see it getting on shelf. Now we shifted about 40%, but what's appearing on shelf is probably just a little bit different because we don't really have that data. But what we're seeing with -- when we see that new package come on shelf is that the (inaudible) improves quite a bit. So we're really encouraged by our performance there, and we're definitely seeing strong consumer reaction to the new package. And so that will obviously continue to build in the fourth quarter. And we're also turning on our media right now, advertising the benefits of the package, but then we're also having holiday campaigns starting to run, too. So we feel like there's a lot of good momentum in the pipeline. Obviously, a lot of that will carry into 2024, but we still feel really good about the strength of that part of our business going into the fourth quarter. It's also helping us, though, is that our core categories are performing a little bit stronger than overall total [edible] in the grocery store. So we see the continued strength there just from a category standpoint. We have good performance across our other core categories like recipe mix, condiments and sauces. So we expect pretty good performance there. But there are some categories where we participate along with our food peers. It's probably at a much smaller scale. But these are categories like frozen or the Asian category, where we've seen more volume decline like we've seen in the rest of the center-of-store in that part of our business. That's just one part of the portfolio that I just give you some color on. We're seeing definitely the type of softness that you're seeing in other categories. But the fundamental trends have not shifted, despite this recovery in China being a lot slower. U.S. and Europe are performing as expected. And as you heard on the call, we kind of reaffirmed our guidance on sales despite China, which is meant to indicate that we still see a strength in the performance of our business overall.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.Alexia Jane Burland HowardCan I ask about the market share trends that we're seeing in Americas Consumer. It's obviously been under pressure for some time because of the distribution losses and so on. But I'm wondering if there's light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when either the comparables get easier or innovation helps to turn it around. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. And then I have a follow-up.Brendan M. FoleyThanks, Alexia. Yes, I think as we take a look at our performance overall in terms of shares, et cetera, just talking maybe specifically the spices and seasonings. The dollars are a bit tricky because we're seeing private label and our competitors take more price right now in the last couple of months to catch up with the pricing that we've taken in the marketplace. So this is helpful, obviously, because it starts to close price gaps. .And so I think you're seeing some stronger dollar performance there. But from a unit standpoint, we believe we're performing even better. That lag is even less. And so as we then look to the pipeline of activities that we have going on, much like I just mentioned on the previous question, whether it's parts of our product line that are really starting to build momentum or distribution that builds momentum, we see a strong pipeline across that part of our portfolio as well as just stronger overall marketing initiatives now that we have really assured supply across all of our portfolio. So when we talk about light at the end of the tunnel, we just see sequential improvement over the course of time as we fall back on distribution points, which we've grown this quarter as well as just the pipeline of activity and renovation that we have across our portfolio. You're seeing a good view of that right now, but there's more to come. And so we do feel pretty confident about our ability to continue driving sequential improvement whether it's in spices and seasonings or across other categories.Michael R. SmithI'd like to -- we think some of the same things we've done in Europe, for example, where we -- as we mentioned today in the call, really good share performance and volume performance in markets like U.K. and France, which are similar to the U.S. So those type of activities we're doing, whether it's innovation, upgrading -- renovating the lines have had success over there, too.Alexia Jane Burland HowardGreat. And just as a quick follow-up. You talked about the free cash flow allowing you to delever more quickly than expected. What's your level of appetite for acquisitions next year? And where are the priorities? Is it Consumer? Is it Flavor Solutions, domestic, international? Just wondering how you're thinking about the pipeline on the M&amp;A side, and I'll pass it on.Michael R. SmithNo, Alexia, as you said, we've had really good success on our operating cash flow. We're really excited about that. As we said on the call today, we're going to delever faster than we thought to get back to our 3x target. We're always looking at acquisitions. I mean we have a corporate development team that is always working with -- internally to look at those assets. We have an appetite as part of our long-term growth algorithm, 1/3 of our 4% to 6% long-term growth algorithm is M&amp;A. However, we're still in the process of paying down debt. I think the fourth quarter is our biggest cash flow quarter generally. As we get into next year, though, as we get closer to our targets, I think as assets come up that are attractive, whether they're Consumer, Flavor Solutions, U.S. international, we really look for things that don't dilute our sales growth. Our top line is really important to us. And you look at the past with Cholula and FONA and RB, those are the type of assets we really like. Would we like it to be a bit more international? Yes. Flavor Solutions now also is an area where we really like that and look at FONA and Giotti as past acquisitions, we're really happy with. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but I think we're getting back to where we want to be -- to enter back in the M&amp;A market, and as long as it meets those strategies -- in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions for attractive assets we'll be buyers hopefully, at the right price.Brendan M. FoleyBut right now, paying down our debt is our priority. Yes.Michael R. SmithYes.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas.Max Andrew Stephen GumportA number of your broader U.S. packaged food peers have been talking about value-seeking behavior, whether it's moving down to cheaper brands in private label or channel shifting or simply buying less units of food. You mentioned some comments earlier about the movement to larger package sizes that you're seeing, but I'm curious if you can talk more broadly about how value-seeking behavior is impacting your business, particularly given you're also a large producer of private label spices and seasonings.Brendan M. FoleyThanks for the question. we're seeing value play out through many different types of actions from the consumer. Some are going to larger sizes, and we see that quite a bit. And as an example of where we're taking an opportunity to continue growing even more quickly. And that part of our portfolio, we're definitely seeing sustainable continued trends towards larger sizes. And what's also interesting about larger sizes, at least in the categories that we have, especially spices and seasonings is that the purchase rate is still just as fast as it was with the smaller size. So people are going through when they have it in the household, they're going through a little bit just as fast or more quickly. But the other way value kind of presents itself to is opportunities like this opening price point. With the pricing that's happened in the market, as we talked about before, it created price pocket and we feel like we needed to fill with a brand like Lawry's. And so now that's playing a role in our portfolio, that's offering a brand to consumers and a lot of consumers still preferred brands, and it's allowing them to move towards a brand that's at a lower opening price point and fills the need, and we're seeing a lot of success with that, too. But the other way we're really talking a lot about value is directly to the consumer, especially if you think about a lot of our communication right now, over the past year has been value-oriented. And we're talking about the role that our portfolio plays in terms of providing flavor for pennies of serving. And that is really having a positive impact, plus a lot of our content is also focusing on how consumers continue to save money by creating, let's say, for example, just larger batch sizes of food and so they can have leftovers for a couple of nights in a row or tricks and hacks like that, that allow consumers to create even more value and stretch the food dollar even further. That's where we see our category really playing a role in the household, especially during this kind of -- where there's a lot of consumer concern around inflation, our categories are playing a helpful role in that. So we're looking at it from a number of different angles, but I've just illustrated 3 right there that we are hitting pretty hard during this period of time.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.Adam SamuelsonI guess maybe trying to take Andrew's question in maybe a slightly different kind of light. Brendan, is there any way to help frame the distribution kind of gains that you're seeing and expect to see over in coming quarters? Any way to quantify kind of what -- how we should think about total distribution growth and where that will peak from a TDP perspective into 2024? It's harder to fully see that expansion in the scanner data. And so I'm wondering if part of it is growth in certain unmeasured channels or value retailers that aren't captured in Nielsen.Brendan M. FoleyWell, Adam, just a few things around TDPs. I'm not going to be talking about what to expect in 2024, just because we'll talk about that guidance as we look at early next year. But just talking a little bit more about TDP performance, it remains an important area of focus for us, and we've been taking a lot of action to the store distribution, which we really lost the supply over the last 1 to 2 years. .I think it's an important reminder that about half of those TDP losses are a result of just proactive discontinuations that we made. And those are not likely to be restored. But we are starting to see TDP growth, something which we said would start to come this year in the third quarter. And we believe that performance is improved versus like the previous 2 quarters of the year. And I would also just share with you that our assortment on shelf now is even more productive than it was versus pre-COVID, so that velocity, those turns that we get on shelf from that assortment there is actually even more productive, not only for McCormick but also for the retailer. And so that's something really important to pass along. And we'll start to see more distribution come online as retailers reset their shelves. We're seeing a bit of that happen right now as we speak going into the fourth quarter, but we expect to see even more of that as we go into '24. So that's one, I think, context around TDPs and distribution that I think provides context and color. We will continue to accelerate innovation. And that's something that we did in 2023. We'll continue to do that in future fiscal years. That will also build on the sort of the TDP momentum in distribution growth that we see. I think those are some of the points that I think that are without calling out a specific TDP number and gain to expect. We continue to see continued improvement, sequential improvement as we look at this over time. And as we mentioned in previous calls, it will take a little bit of time to get it back, but we are still making forward progress on this.Adam SamuelsonOkay. That's helpful. And if I could just ask a separate question on the Flavor Solutions segment. And as you think about some of the different customer types that you have and geographies, how would you frame kind of recent inbound kind of bid activity in RFPs and contract win rates? Are you seeing your customers accelerate their innovation agenda to drive growth in their business? Or is activity levels slowing down? And just any color -- as you think about that pipeline of new business wins, kind of how would you frame that?Brendan M. FoleyI'd point to our performance in the Americas as an example as to how to think about our current momentum on our flavor business. We had really good sales growth, but we also had some volume growth. And -- that's an example of what we're seeing not only through our flavors business, but also branded foodservice. And we are starting to -- we are growing share in a number of the strong categories that we participate in. We talked about Performance Nutrition or the health end market. We see it happening there or even in alcoholic beverages. We have been seeing some nice growth in gains in that part of our business. So is there anything particularly unique at this point in the year versus what it was like earlier in the year? No, I don't think I can point to anything that's terribly unique that we haven't already talked about before, but this has been an element of sort of continued sequential improvement in performance. We've been able to grow a little bit of volume here probably because of the strength of our products and technology that go into the categories we play in. And so that's, I think, some of the context there. We're happy to be growing share. We believe that we have the right plans. Now if you look at elsewhere within Flavor Solutions, our EMEA business tends to be more heavily weighted towards the QSR part of our customer base. They're not seeing the type of traffic and promotions that they have in, let's say, the prior year or so. We still see a little bit of pressure on overall volumes there. Conversely, in Asia Pacific, our QSR business there is actually doing quite well. Customers are turning back on promotions. They're trying to drive more traffic in their stores. And so we, as a result, we're also seeing some nice volume growth in that part of our portfolio in Flavor Solutions. But dialing back to sort of that flavor part of our category, we're pleased with the performance that we've made so far this year and its continued momentum, but nothing there's sort of new inflection point to share with you.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersSo I wanted to ask on the incremental gross margin improvement that you see in your outlook this quarter, building on a raise that happened last quarter as well. And just if you could put a little bit of context and detail around exactly what's driving that incremental gross margin upside? Question number one. And then question number two is, as we've seen that gross margin tick up over the balance of the year. We haven't seen you change your reinvestment strategy in terms of brand marketing. I just wanted a little bit of color and context as to why that isn't a source of reinvestment as you do realize that gross margin upside.Michael R. SmithThanks, Steve. This is Mike. I'll take that one. I'm surprised it took 5 questions to get to gross margin. So thanks for asking that question. First of all, we're really pleased with the gross margin performance this year. We've had improvement. We had a strong third quarter. If you think about the things we're doing with the cost recovery through our pricing, which we've really been successful at this year, the GOE and CCI commitments we put out at the beginning of the year, we're really happy with our performance there across both segments. That's the other thing. These margin improvements are happening both on the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side, which is really -- which is great. As far as raising for the year, as you know, we've had good performance year-to-date. And even with some of the challenges in China, I mean our strong underlying performance has really held through. So as to why we wouldn't raise really the A&amp;P spend, I mean, we feel really comfortable with where we are from A&amp;P with our current guide. The third quarter was up 8%, and it was the highest dollar amount we've ever spent in the third quarter. So we feel we're very effective there. Actually, CCI is a topic we get savings across all cost of goods sold, but to get it on SG&amp;A, too. And A&amp;P is an area where the teams have gotten real cost savings or efficiencies in our advertising program. So it's even higher than you see from a dollar perspective. So I think we're confident where we are in gross margin. We're building back. If you go back to pre-'19 -- pre-COVID in 2019, our gross margins were around 40%. Using our implied guidance this year gets you around 37%. And the interesting thing is if you look at the math on the pricing dilution that has happened, it's been -- I mean it's over a 500 basis point headwind to us which you can see, we're down 300 basis points. So during that time, through CCI and other things, we've built -- we've capture some of that back, which we continue to see in the future as we get back to those pre-COVID gross margin and operating profit levels.Brendan M. FoleySteve, if I could -- there was a question in there about A&amp;P, too. And just to really kind of build on that. In that -- we are up significantly in the third quarter standing at 8%. But we -- this is probably our highest historical spend, right? So we're really putting a lot more in A&amp;P as we sort of called out, and we'll have a strong level again in the fourth quarter, and these are going into a lot of important campaigns right now. So I just want to reinforce, I think, we are seeing still increase in spend in that part of our -- in that line of the P&amp;L.Stephen Robert R. PowersOkay. That's great. And so I guess -- that's helpful. And Mike, so just playing back the various puts and takes on gross margin. Is it fair to say that the biggest sort of upside surprise for you over the course of the year has just -- has been a successful price realization? Or are there elements of business mix or other drivers there? Because it feels like the productivity has come in solidly, but roughly in line with, I think, original expectations, cost inflation hasn't changed materially. So it seems like the buckets has to be pricing or...Michael R. SmithThe way I say it, Steve, everything is going to move in the right direction. We were successful getting our cost recovery. We got some pricing earlier, as you've probably inferred from some of our pricing numbers. So we got our pricing faster than last year, which was helpful. And the GOE and CCI programs, like I said, have met target. And frankly, we're a bit prudent this year. I think as we said -- as we gave guidance in January after last year, we wanted to make sure we hit our numbers. There was a lot of big assumptions going into 2023, pricing, GOE programs, things like that. And we knew that China, we were counting on a China recovery, which impacts not only gross margin but operating profit. So we thought at this time after Q3, where we see us spending for the year. We felt -- to be a good line of sight to the commodity cost, things like that, too, which gave us the comfort to get there. The other thing, too, is as you think -- and when Brendan was talking a little bit about the strong or underlying performance and things like spices and seasonings, when you look at our performance in other markets, we've had really good portfolio -- really good portfolio mix. And some of the things we're doing on portfolio optimization with pruning low-margin business does help gross margins also and will help us as we go into the future.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel.Matt SmithIf I could follow up on the margin commentary and the headwind from pricing dilution. As we look at the Flavor Solutions business, you've been making margin recovery progress there. But can you talk about the factors that are keeping the current margin 400 basis points or so below historical levels? And how much of that is the mechanical pricing impact versus other factors? And then what supports the margin recovery from here?Michael R. SmithYes, it's a great question, Matt. If you think about it pre-COVID, we were at 14.5% operating profit, which at the time we were really happy with because we came from a low of around 6% several years before, but we also did acknowledge that as we migrate our portfolio, we had higher aspirations to get higher than that as we migrated to more flavor type products. COVID has been -- and the cost related to that, it really has been a big challenge to us and a headwind and also the huge cost increases benefit Flavor Solutions. So last year, we were at 8%, as you know. This year with -- we're looking to build back. Year-to-date, we're around 10%. So probably around that for the end of the year. So a 200 basis point improvement this year back to the -- back to your question on dilution. At the operating profit level, we've had about a 300 basis point [mass] dilution impact on Flavor Solutions. So theoretically, if that didn't happen, and I know it did happen, but that 10% would become 13%. So we're about 150 basis points short of that pre-'19 or pre-COVID '19 margin improvement and things like we've done with GOE, which we see continuing and wrapping into next year. The dual running costs, we're having primarily in our Flavor Solutions business in the U.K. manufacturing facility. That goes away partially next year or the year after it's totally gone, which is great, continued CCI. So these type of things will get us back to -- and portfolio migration, pruning at low-margin business we talked about some of the private label foodservice business in the EMEA this call. Those type of things we're focused really, really well on getting our margins up. And some of the things, when Brendan talks about Performance Nutrition and beverage, those are the flavor type items, they're growing faster. We really like those and I think they can help margin of our whole Flavor Solutions portfolio.Brendan M. FoleyBut we do like the progress we're making independent of pricing dilution just on overall improvement in the margin there. So we do believe we're moving in the right direction.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.Robert Bain MoskowI wanted to know about the guide -- the implied guide for organic sales growth in fourth quarter. It looks like it's about 3%. And that marks a substantial deceleration from the first 3 quarters. And then even when we try to look at that on a 4-year basis, just using like 2019 as the base, it's again, a big decline. We're all looking at the U.S. retail data in Nielsen and IRI, it's all decelerating. Are you taking that into account in your guide? And if so, it sounds a little like a disconnect from the expectations for a very strong holiday season.Michael R. SmithRob, just to clarify, you've mentioned the word or number, 3%. Our implied guide is in the midpoint is 3.7% to 11.2%, which implies 7.5%...Robert Bain MoskowI'm just trying to get to your -- I'm just trying to plug in a fourth quarter organic sales number to get to your midpoint of 5% to 7% or 6% for the year.Brendan M. FoleyYes. I think Rob, Brendan. The thing to keep in mind, I think for the fourth quarter, it is our largest quarter. So we're not able to provide a precise estimate, but I think some broad concepts to consider is we do expect some growth in China in Consumer in the fourth quarter, if you recall, we're lapping over a pretty severe lockdown at that time -- this time a year ago overall. We still expect to have a reasonable impact from the DSD discontinuation in the Americas, heavier because it's during the holiday season. We still expect some softness in Flavor Solutions demand that will persist -- that will certainly be there, but we will also lap the impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as the consumer business exit in Russia. So those are just some considerations, I think, when we take a look at fourth quarter sales.Michael R. SmithYes. I think, Rob, just a follow-up on my point before, from a reported basis, our implied fourth quarter guidance is 3.7% at the low end to 11.2%. That includes about 2% FX favorable because FX was backloaded favorable this year. So constant currency is 5% to 5.5% range. So I'm not sure where the 3% is coming from for the fourth quarter you mentioned? And maybe as a follow-up -- maybe we can make sure your model is okay.Robert Bain MoskowThat's fine. So maybe that answers the question, Mike. So you're not expecting any kind of decel in U.S. retail conditions in fourth quarter. Yes..Brendan M. FoleyNo. In fact -- yes, we do believe we're having, again, underlying improvement. We we've mentioned this the last few quarters, and we continue to progress there.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.Robert Frederick DickersonI just wanted to ask you a question about the renovated SKUs. I think I heard you say in the prepared remarks about -- I think it's 40% the renovated SKUs, maybe, your own shelf. So maybe just as a reminder, just curious kind of when you're thinking about total SKU selection, it sounds like maybe it's more spice and seasoning, kind of what percent is being renovated? And then kind of what's the feedback so far as to why that's driving velocity? It's just consumers are more attracted to different packaging, or it doesn't sound like these are different SKUs.Brendan M. FoleyThanks for the question. Just to make sure I clarify what we said in the prepared remarks, about 40% of those SKUs are shipping. And the SKUs we're talking about is part of our core herbs and spices line. These tend to be those straight fill items, meaning it's bottle of cumin or bottle of cinnamon, et cetera. So that's what we're calling those straight fill spices. And we have visibility to the SKUs that are being shipped. It's not as easy to track exactly what has hit shelf yet. And that's really dependent on the retailer's plans. But where we know what it has, there's really been an improvement in velocity overall. And one of the drivers of that, just there's a lot of different benefits from this new package. We've talked about it before, but it is nitrogen-flushed. So there's even -- what we're providing there is just greater long-term freshness. Until you open up that package, we're really securing the freshness of that product. There's sort of a nice click and snap with the cap that really kind of tells the consumer not only just through seeing, but also listening, there's a real sort of snap to disclosure that kind of, again, creates to retain freshness. And the package is 50% post-consumer recycled plastic. So it also has a big sustainability benefit. And just has a great appearance on the shelf overall. And so we knew that this was a strong packaging innovation because we've launched it in other markets around the world, like EMEA, and also -- it's also going also in Asia Pacific, too. So we have some experience with this package and how it performs and we're seeing similar, if not better, velocity performance as we get started here on U.S. shelves. So just -- that's a little bit of context around what we're seeing from that renovation in our product line.Michael R. SmithYes. And just to reemphasize that, that 40% is really shipped. I mean, if you walk into a store today, it might be 10% of the items or 5% or 20% depending on the stores, but it depends on times on their supply chain, too. So we see like a good tailwind into next year from those two.Robert Frederick DickersonGot it. Okay. Super. And maybe just quickly and kind of simplistically on SG&amp;A. Q3, you ran for total SG&amp;A about 22% of revenues. Clearly, that's up, but kind of in line-ish, right, relative to maybe the kind of prior 4, 5 years. As we think about Q4 and then, I guess, kind of going forward, is like 22% of sales, is that kind of fair? Or could there be certain quarter-to-quarter movement?Michael R. SmithYes. I mean third quarter, I think it was a bit of a high watermark for SG&amp;A. We had a big incentive comp as we talked about on the call, incentive comp started build back for a couple of reasons. And remember, last year's third quarter was way down. So the incentive comp was getting adjusted in. So the build back this year was a big part of SG&amp;A on a smaller quarter than the fourth quarter. So you got to think about it in that makable terms, too. And really, that incentive comp was driven not only by the EPS improvement which everyone in the company, which is great. Within our regions, the mix of our regional -- underlying strength of our Americas and the EMEA region did drive a bit more -- it might be -- or excuse me, incentive comp, but also the great working capital performance. And people forget this sometimes, I mean, we're EVA, economic value-added company. We have a working capital charge component of our incentive compensation. So last year when working capital wasn't great, we all got dinged for us. This year, we're doing great and is coming through incentive comps. So it's just another reason we're driving cash and really those type of activities help us lever down and things like that, which are really great. So a bit more of that impact in the third quarter. And then brand marketing, we mentioned up 8%. So really strong performance there. And for the year, we stick to our guidance, low single-digit A&amp;P.Robert Frederick DickersonAnd maybe if I could just sneak one last one in. Asia Pac, clearly, I understand what you're talking about in terms of just kind of a slower China recovery. And I think you called out maybe a few kind of one-off drivers, but maybe it's more EMEA-driven kind of net-net, right, Asia Pac and consumer was still down in the quarter, but clearly, Asia Pac, Flavor Solutions is doing better, and I realize like part of your China business is in Consumer, but like maybe it's still somewhat foodservice. So I'm just trying to understand kind of the comparison between kind of Asia Pac -- Consumer versus Asia Pac Flavor Solutions and what's driving the delta?Brendan M. FoleyWell, I appreciate the question there, Rob, on China. It's probably worth unpacking that a little bit. I would say though, despite the pace of recovery in this business having been slower than expected, we continue to lead in the long-term growth trajectory of that business. And it's also when you step back on a constant currency basis, we are growing this business versus a year ago, we've grown sales in the high single digits. So yes, we're disappointed that the pace of recovery wasn't what we expected it to be. But nevertheless, we are growing sales year-over-year. And even despite the volatility since 2019, we've grown our total China business at a 3% CAGR on a constant currency basis, which is kind of in line with the long-term algorithm. So this is really an element of an economy that certainly is recovering more slowly than what we would have expected. And what -- where we see that now this kind of goes into sort of how we're thinking about Flavor Solutions versus Consumer. And part of that consumer business is in the foodservice channel, but people are just simply not necessarily going out to a lot of the catering and outside dining events that we've seen in the past, and that's just been a slower recovery overall. And we're also seeing that also happening in retail. Consumer spending is just soft right now overall in China, and we're seeing that play out. Where we start to see -- and this was actually more of a change in this quarter, just more of the typical promotional activity or limited time offers that we tend to see in the QSR segment have begun to come back a little bit more. So that gives us some reason to believe that this is just a slower recovery than what we planned, but the fundamentals that drive that business are still there, and it's just going to take a little bit more time to get back to what we expect from this part of our business.OperatorWe've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Faten Freiha for closing remarks.Faten FreihaThank you all for joining today's call. If you have any further questions regarding today's information, please feel free to contact me. And that concludes this morning's conference call. Thank you.]"

""Our planning and focus on the long term have helped us surge past other airlines that stood still. I'm convinced our strategy is the right one as we continue to add new, larger aircraft to take full advantage of our growing flying opportunities both internationally and domestically.""United expects to take delivery of about 800 new narrowbody and widebody aircraft between 2023 and the end of 2032.Larger Aircraft to More PlacesA key component of the United Next plan is growth in gauge, essentially flying larger planes with more available seats on the same route. Given that United currently operates out of the largest markets in the country - Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark/NYC, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. - upgauging also boosts overall connectivity domestically and internationally.In 2019, United averaged 104 seats per North American departure, among the lowest in the industry. By 2027, United expects that number to jump more than 40% to over 145. United now has 180 A321neo and over 370 737 MAX aircraft on firm order through 2030, a combination that will drive the average seats per departure even higher on these larger aircraft, with even lower anticipated per-seat costs.Story continuesFleet FlexibilityUnited's latest aircraft order starts at the end of the decade and can be used for fleet growth or replacement, depending on the demand and the economic climate at the time. And from a widebody perspective, the 50 incremental 787-9s that United ordered today will allow the airline to further simplify its international fleet – another benefit to customers and employees as well as an area of cost savings.United is already the largest carrier across the Atlantic and Pacific. The airline now has 150 Boeing 787s on firm order – more than any airline in the world.New Customer Amenities and Lower Carbon EmissionsThe new aircraft in today's order will have the same customer amenities, technological innovations and fuel efficiency benefits as previous United Next narrowbody and widebody orders. For narrowbodies, these include seatback screens in every seat, enough overhead room for everyone's carry-on, Bluetooth connectivity, and fast Wi-Fi. And each new widebody features United Polaris® business class, where customers get their own pod with a lie-flat seats and 16-inch seatback screens. The airline recently announced new business class amenity products and services from Therabody and Saks Fifth Avenue.Plus, these new aircraft will continue to reduce United's per-seat carbon emissions compared to the older models they replace, in line with the airline's expectation to be net zero by 2050 by reducing GHG emissions 100% without relying on traditional carbon offsets. According to Boeing, the 787 Dreamliner contributes up to a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency and lower carbon emissions per seat compared with the airplanes it replaces and according to Airbus, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft.United expects that 75% of its fleet will be new-generation by 2030.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The Way. With U.S. hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., United operates the most comprehensive global route network among North American carriers and is now the largest airline in the world as measured by available seat miles.

244,61afe984-629f-3526-986d-1dbde5638b5a,UAL,2023-10-04,United Airlines Buys 110 Airbus and Boeing Planes Amid Persistent Capacity Constraints,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-buys-110-airbus-200000056.html,1696363200,STORY,"['AIR.PA', 'AC.TO', 'EADSY', 'BA', 'UAL']","[United ordered another 60 Airbus A321neos days before it was set to take delivery of its first of the type. (United) United AirlinesUnited Airlines is betting that the constraints limiting airline schedules will persist for years, and it’s responding with a new order for 110 Airbus and Boeing planes.The deal is for 60 Airbus A321neos and 50 Boeing 787-9s for delivery between 2028 and 2031, the Chicago-based carrier unveiled Tuesday. It also includes 40 additional purchase rights for the A321neo and 50 options for the 787. The orders build on ones United placed with Airbus and Boeing for narrowbodies in 2021 and primarily widebodies in 2022.The orders are driven, in part, by United’s need to replace older planes by the end of the decade, as well as grow at capacity-constrained airports around the world. Those constraints include the air traffic controller shortage in the U.S. and Europe, and government restrictions to achieve climate and other goals – for example, the Netherlands’ plan to cut flights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport next summer.For an airline to grow under these constraints, they need to operate aircraft with more seats, a strategy known as “upgauging.”United’s latest aircraft order will enable it to add seats to its existing schedules at constrained airports, including Newark, San Francisco, and in Europe and Asia. “Gauge growth is how United will manage an increasing number of limitations on runways, air space, and gate capacity at the nation’s largest airports while still growing,” said Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella Tuesday.The A321neos will seat 200 passengers – they will replace Boeing 757-200s that seat up to 176 passengers. The new 787-9s will seat 257 passengers versus just 167 to 240 passengers for the current Boeing 767s. The carrier plans to retire its 757s and 767s by the end of the decade.United does not intend to replace its 757s and 767s with A321neos and 787s on a one-for-one basis, Nocella said. However, the strategy is to use the new planes to grow via more seats per flight rather than more flights overall.Story continuesIn fact, at Newark, which was plagued by weather and air traffic control-related delays this summer, the carrier plans to operate fewer daily departures than it did in 2019 over the long term.The airline is scheduled to take delivery of its first A321neo — part of its 2021 airplane order — next week, Nocella said. United plans to introduce it on revenue flights between Chicago and Phoenix in December.New Aircraft ShortageBoth Airbus and Boeing face challenges meeting their aircraft delivery commitments on time. The situation is made worse by delays at their suppliers, including the well-documented issues facing Pratt &amp; Whitney’s geared turbofan engines on the A320neo family.Air Lease Corp. Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy in September called the situation for airplane makers “a real problem area,” that was fueling increased demand for leased aircraft.Airlines are eager to lock in delivery slots. Air Canada, Air France-KLM, Cathay Pacific, and Latam Airlines have all ordered additional Airbus and Boeing models in the past two weeks.Nocella cited the supply chain limits in his comments, adding that United’s deliveries this year are “significantly” delayed and that is unlikely to change for years to come. The timing of deliveries for the airline’s new order at the end of the decade is later than is typical for United, he said.Asked about United’s willingness to place such a large order amid global economic uncertainty, Nocella said the carrier was confident in its outlook and had flexibility to adjust the timing of plane deliveries and other aspects of the deals.United and its peers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, continue to see strong travel demand this fall in part fueled by large international networks. Their U.S. domestic-focused competitors – Breeze Airways, Frontier, JetBlue, and Spirit – have reported weak bookings and revised down their earnings estimates with some expecting losses in the third quarter.All airlines face increased cost pressure driven by rising fuel prices and new, more costly labor agreements. Pilots at United recently ratified a new accord with up to 40% pay increases.United had 657 aircraft on firm order at the end of June, its latest fleet plan shows. That includes 45 Airbus A350s that were ordered by the airline before its merger with Continental Airlines in 2010, and have been postponed repeatedly in the decade-plus since.The airline maintains its A350 order, Nocella said. He declined to comment on whether United will ever take delivery of the planes given its plan to take delivery of 150 new 787s — the main competitor of the A350 — between now and the end of the decade.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Credit: Sergio Flores/BloombergPNC Financial Services Group is the latest bank to take advantage of the regional bank failures that shook the industry this spring.The Pittsburgh bank said Tuesday that it has purchased a portfolio, representing $16.6 billion in total commitments, from Signature Bridge Bank via the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The purchase could help grow the bank's fund banking business, which helps private equity firms manage liquidity and finance investments in the short term. The portfolio includes $9 billion in funded loans, PNC said.""This could allow PNC to expand its relationship with the venture capital/private equity industry and extend new loans in what has become a dislocated market given the failures of top players in the space earlier this year,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday.The $558 billion-asset PNC has developed a reputation for its strategic and aggressive stance toward acquisitions in recent years. It joins JPMorgan Chase, First Citizens BancShares and New York Community Bancorp on the list of banks that have benefited from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank earlier this year. Signature failed on March 12 amid a deposit run.""We view this news positively as historical asset purchases from the FDIC have generally been very favorable to buyers,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote in a note.PNC's 2020 agreement to acquire BBVA USA for $11.6 billion made it one of the 10 largest holding companies in the U.S. The deal, which included BBVA branches in Texas and in parts of the South and Southwest, marked an important milestone on PNC's journey to become a bank that operates nationwide.The price of the deal for the Signature portfolio wasn't disclosed, but PNC said it was funded with cash on hand. The bank had about $6.2 billion of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, according to regulatory filings.Unlike some other deals for parts of failed banks, PNC's agreement with the FDIC doesn't include loss-sharing protections, the bank said. The FDIC often uses those agreements, in which the agency agrees to share losses with the acquiring institution, to encourage healthy banks to bid for parts of failed banks.PNC said it expects the deal to be accretive to its earnings and to represent approximately $0.10 per share starting in the fourth quarter. That represents about a $0.40 increase in earnings per share on an annualized basis, RBC analysts estimated.The bank said it would release more details about the deal when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Oct. 13.]"

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Pinnacle West is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IdaCorp has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PNW is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PNW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.05, while IDA has a forward P/E of 17.78. We also note that PNW has a PEG ratio of 2.64. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. IDA currently has a PEG ratio of 4.83.Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P/B ratio of 1.33. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IDA has a P/B of 1.58.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help PNW earn a Value grade of B, while IDA has been given a Value grade of D.PNW stands above IDA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PNW is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

256,1afce3f6-ee0c-3d55-ab05-80dd10cc06b3,PNW,2023-10-04,Here's Why Pinnacle West (PNW) is Poised for a Turnaround After Losing -6.19% in 4 Weeks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-pinnacle-west-pnw-133505951.html,1696340105,STORY,['PNW'],"[Pinnacle West (PNW) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 6.2% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why PNW Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 23.19 for PNW is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PNW in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, PNW currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

At present, the facility has no outstanding balances.Per Mike LaBelle, EVP, CFO &amp; Treasurer of the company, “We are pleased to expand our borrowing capacity and increase the number of participants in our credit facility. This upsizing, especially in current market conditions, is a further testament to BXP’s strong financial position and the strength and support of our banking relationships.”The utilization of the accordion feature added three new lenders — M&amp;T Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. — to the facility. BPLP can now increase its total commitments under the facility by up to an additional $185 million, subject to certain conditions.In January 2023, BPLP closed a new $1.2 billion unsecured term loan facility that matures in May 2024. The facility can be prolonged by exercising one 12-month extension subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.Boston Properties is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through repositioning initiatives via acquisitions, the development of properties in core markets and shedding properties in non-core markets.Also, amid strong demand from life-science tenants, it is converting numerous straight office buildings to office labs in its suburban portfolio, especially its Kendall Center project, which is one of the leading preferred locations for life-science clients in the world.Notably, as of the end of the second quarter of 2023, BXP had 13 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway, with its share of the estimated total investment aggregating around $2.6 billion, which seems encouraging.With added balance sheet strength and ample financial flexibility, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.

With 26% stake, hedge funds possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since hedge funds have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Westrock Coffee. Check out our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Westrock Coffee?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Westrock Coffee does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Westrock Coffee, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthIt would appear that 26% of Westrock Coffee shares are controlled by hedge funds. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Westrock Asset Management, LLC with 26% of shares outstanding. With 15% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, HF Capital and James Sowell are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur research also brought to light the fact that roughly 54% of the company is controlled by the top 4 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Westrock CoffeeWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Westrock Coffee Company. It has a market capitalization of just US$774m, and insiders have US$119m worth of shares in their own names. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can  click here to see if they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Westrock Coffee. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Equity OwnershipWith an ownership of 6.3%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 15%, of the Westrock Coffee stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Westrock Coffee .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

With this, 2023 marked the fourth year in a row that the S&amp;P 500 logged losses in September, per data from Deutsche Bank.Fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period took the sheen away from stocks in the month. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, shed 3.1% last month. Despite the losses, some stocks in the ETF stood tall.We have highlighted five stocks that are in green and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). These include Centene Corporation CNC, WestRock WRK, CF Industries Holdings Inc CF, Valero Energy VLO and Charter Communications CHTR.The Fed, in its latest meeting, kept interest rates steady at a 22-year high, in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled one more hike this year. Though inflation is easing, it remains elevated and above the Fed’s 2% target (read: Bet on Quality ETFs as Fed Keeps Rate Steady, View Hawkish).Meanwhile, the latest bouts of weak economic data have sparked fears of a slowdown. U.S. consumer sentiment slipped for the second straight month in September as the University of Michigan's preliminary reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 67.7 from the final reading of 69.5 in August. Meanwhile, new home sales declined 8.7% in August from July and home prices continued to ascend, with the Case-Shiller Index growing 1% year over year in July.  Further, the combination of a steadily appreciating U.S. dollar, escalating yields, and surging oil prices presents a trio of challenges that could potentially impede the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy, posing concerns for investors. In fact, surging oil prices threaten to revive inflationary pressure. Moreover, Wall Street is grappling with global economic uncertainties, U.S. auto workers' strike that may intensify inflation, and the reinstatement of U.S. student loan repayments that could impact household spending.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets.

(NYSE:RCL) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 16% in the last quarter. While that might be a setback, it doesn't negate the nice returns received over the last twelve months. In that time we've seen the stock easily surpass the market return, with a gain of 98%.While the stock has fallen 4.1% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises Because Royal Caribbean Cruises made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.Over the last twelve months, Royal Caribbean Cruises' revenue grew by 156%. That's well above most other pre-profit companies. The solid 98% share price gain goes down pretty well, but it's not necessarily as good as you might expect given the top notch revenue growth. If that's the case, now might be the time to take a close look at Royal Caribbean Cruises. Since we evolved from monkeys, we think in linear terms by nature. So if growth goes exponential, opportunity may exist for the enlightened.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Royal Caribbean Cruises will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Royal Caribbean Cruises shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 98% over the last year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 5% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Royal Caribbean Cruises has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

This coming amid higher fuel costs and currency headwinds. Shares of Norwegian, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean all in the red. That we should mention, Julie, I mean, some of these names have had some monster runs this year, too. They may be in the red, but I'm just looking at Carnival, for example, it is up nearly 60% this year. And most analysts cover that name still think you should own it.But again, also, there a bigger idea that is the consumer to the extent they get a little nervous. And we even hear guests on today's show say, some believe that's going to happen. If you think that, then maybe consumer discretionary names could come under some pressure here.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, and two notes here. So you mentioned it's consumer discretionary names, which, as I said, is the worst performing group in the S&amp;P 500 today. Cruise lines are part of the reason why. I think the question that has really come to the fore in investors' minds now with a lot of these companies, how long is it going to last?You know, we have had the good times, as you mentioned, right? People have been traveling. People have continued to spend money. We talked to Kevin Mahn of Hennion &amp; Walsh earlier in the show. And he was raising just that question, right? Are people savings starting to work down? Are they going to continue to have a job, get a raise at the same rate, et cetera?Story continuesAnd these are-- now, it might be that it will continue. It's continued longer already than a lot of people expected. But these questions are really, you know, one of the things--JOSH LIPTON: Listen, it's why you're watching the labor market the way you are, right, because, at the end of the day, low unemployment sub-4% and strong wage gains, that's why you're waiting for any cracks in that market.JULIE HYMAN: Yes. We're seeing a few cracks today, it feels like. One of the other places where we're seeing that manifest is in recently spun-off companies. So far-- and a lot of these spin-offs have been happening in just the past few days, right? So you've got Vestis Corporation, which was a spin-off from Aramark. The big food services company, this, I believe, is the apparel part of that. Veralto Corporation spun off from Danaher. And then WK Kellogg, of course, spinning off from Kellogg, which is now Kellanova.And so all of these since we saw, the spin-offs have been underperforming. And, you know, I think there are some specifics with these companies. But I think there is also just this broader I don't want to take any risk in this market of attitude manifesting in the past few days.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, that's right. And also, listen, I mean, company can make its case about why a spin-off makes sense. I mean, Kellogg can say, look, we're going to spin off Froot Loops. And it's going to get narrow and focus and not distracted by the Eggo Waffles. That doesn't mean that the Street or investors are necessarily going to buy it or at least immediately.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, exactly. You know, maybe they wanted that growth that came with the snacks business that is not happening in the cereal business.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: We'll see what happens.JOSH LIPTON: And finally, Eli Lilly to buy radio pharmaceutical company Point Biopharma global for $1.4 billion. The acquisition aiming to expand Eli Lilly's oncology capabilities and next-generation radial gland therapies. And Eli Lilly, of course, Julie, has been on a tear this year. Of course, that's on the potential of weight loss drugs and Alzheimer's. But clearly, building out this oncology portfolio as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And we see Eli Lilly shares moving down. On a day like this, it's tough to suss out what's from this deal versus what's from the overall downdraft. I did see a little chatter on the part of analysts that at $12.50 per share. This is sort of the upper end of the price that analysts were expecting. So perhaps some questions over the premium that Eli Lilly is paying in this case. And that might be contributing to some of the drop in the shares. But again, on a day like this, when so much of the market is down, it's tough to--JOSH LIPTON: There's a lot of cross-currents. I will say, folks are also pointing out that Fusion Pharmaceuticals surging today. And that's a peer to Point Biopharma. So many people are trying to sniff out the next target.]"

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapIs Royal Caribbean Group a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Royal Caribbean Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.65, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years. These indicators suggest that Royal Caribbean Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap.

GIII has been doing well, thanks to its robust strategies, including digital expansion and brand strength, and sound fundamentals. The company has been undertaking several strategies, including acquisitions and the licensing of well-known brands, to expand its product portfolio. Management is optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio of key brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston.Buoyed by such endeavors, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged a whopping 80.9% year to date. Meanwhile, the industry fell 6.6% in this year so far.Let’s Delve DeeperG-III Apparel’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via the ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding its global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing the inventory.We note that the company has numerous growth opportunities including the repositioning and expansion of the Donna Karan label and a long-term license for the Nautica brand. G-III Apparel will produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. First deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall. Management has announced a new multi-year license agreement with HanesBrands to manufacture an outerwear collection for the Champion brand. The company will create quality heritage pieces to expand Champions' lifestyle offering. The product will be distributed via its diverse channels across North America and Champions' global network with the first deliveries scheduled for fall of 2024.With respect to the company’s brand progress, the key brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston are likely to perform well. Expanding the company’s owned brands, which include DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin, is a priority as these brands represent an important long-term profit. Also, these brands enable the company to further widen its global reach. In fiscal 2024, with the ownership of the whole Karl Lagerfeld brand, the company’s international sales will be up 20% versus the prior year. Management believes this business can expand to more than $3 billion in annual revenues over time.Story continuesWhat’s More?G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and improved year over year. For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales to be about $3.30 billion and net income to be $145-$150 million, or between $3.05 per share and $3.15 per share. This compares favorably to net sales of $3.23 billion and a net loss of $(133.1) million, or $(2.79) per share, for fiscal 2023. It expects continued gross margin improvement for the rest of the fiscal year, and projects ending the year with the gross margin up nearly 450 bps year over year. The second half of fiscal 2024’s gross margin will benefit from moderated freight costs.Analysts seem optimistic about the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.30 billion and $3.27, respectively. These estimates show corresponding increases of 8% and 14.7% year over year. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 sales and EPS currently stands at $3.37 billion and $3.41, respectively, reflecting corresponding increases of 1.9% and 4.5% year over year.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.

(NASDAQ:ROST)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-ross-stores-113039319.html,1696419039,STORY,['ROST'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Ross Stores is US$120 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$112 suggests Ross Stores is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for ROST is US$129, which is 7.4% above our fair value estimateToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Ross Stores What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.47bUS$1.64bUS$1.75bUS$2.00bUS$2.17bUS$2.31bUS$2.42bUS$2.52bUS$2.61bUS$2.69bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.08%Est @ 4.90%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.50%Est @ 3.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$53bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$26bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$112, the company appears about fair value at a 6.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ross Stores as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.030. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Ross StoresStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

Consequently, retailers proactively tackle logistical and inventory challenges, devising comprehensive strategies to ensure a seamless shopping experience, both in physical stores and online.To cater to consumers' product preferences, retailers focus on restocking shelves with high-demand merchandise and significantly invest in digitization. These efforts are expected to lead to the hiring of numerous seasonal associates who will play pivotal roles in managing curbside and in-store pickups of online orders, as well as doorstep deliveries.However, this holiday season might not be as exuberant as before, given that consumers are adopting a more cautious approach regarding their disposable income. They are grappling with various economic challenges, including inflation, elevated interest rates, the impending return of student loan obligations and depleting savings.As the once easily spent ""discretionary dollar"" becomes harder for consumers to part with, retailers must adapt to this evolving landscape. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are expected to increase 3.7% from the previous year during the traditional holiday period spanning from Nov 1 to Dec 24. To put this into context, holiday sales grew 7.6% last year.That said, we have highlighted four stocks from the Retail - Wholesale sector that look well-positioned based on their sound fundamentals.Past-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research4 Prominent PicksUrban Outfitters URBN is worth betting on.

The fourth quarter of any year historically remains favorable to U.S. stock markets as it deals with the holiday season. Notably, during the holiday season the retail sector gets maximum importance. This year too, the scenario remains the same.Retail sales have not been impacted much due to record-high inflationary pressures. U.S. consumption expenditure stayed buoyant despite the Fed pursuing an extremely high interest rate regime in the last one and a half years.Research firm Deloitte estimated that the total holiday retail sales in 2023 will be in the range of $1.54 to $1.56 trillion during the November to January timeframe. This marks an year-over-year improvement of 3.5% to 4.6% in 2023. Deloitte also forecast that within the total holiday retail sales, e-commerce sales will account for $278 billion to $284 billion. This marks a year-over-year improvement of 10.3% to 12.8%.Mastercard SpendingPulse estimated that holiday retail sales (excluding automotive) between Nov 1 and Dec 24, are expected to increase 3.7% year over year. E-commerce and online sales are likely to grow 6.7% and 2.9%, respectively.Bain &amp; Company forecasts nominal U.S. retail sales to grow 3% year over year in November and December, reaching nearly $915 billion, with 90% of the growth coming from non-store (e-commerce and mail-order) sales.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five retail giants that have strong growth potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has been benefiting from a strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate has contributed well. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio are positives for AMZN. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is also encouraging. Its advertising business is also making a robust contribution. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings are tailwinds for AMZN.Story continuesZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.1% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 43.9% over the last 60 days.Walmart Inc. WMT has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance store and online experience. WMT has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services. Increased market share in grocery continued to boost U.S. comps in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Strong comps growth globally, expense leverage and e-commerce growth across all units favored the company. WMT raised its guidance for fiscal 2024.Zacks Rank #2 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.3% and 2.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.Ross Stores Inc. ROST has benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings. ROST has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years.ROST operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores, which target value-conscious men and women, aged 25 to 54 in middle-to-upper middle-class households. ROST has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios.Zacks Rank #1 Ross Stores has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 19.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the last 60 days.Lithia Motors Inc.’s LAD diversified product mix and multiple streams of income reduce its risk profile and position it for long-term sales and profit growth. LAD is on a buyout spree, which is increasing its market share.Enhanced digital solutions — including the Driveway e-commerce program — are helping LAD to further boost profitability and market presence. Driveway generated $900 million in revenues in 2022 and expects to hit $9 billion in annual revenues by 2025, thus paving the path for LAD’s rapid growth.Zacks Rank #1 Lithia Motors has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.6% and 1.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s BABA solid momentum across the China and international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. Notably, China commerce retail business is driven by rising online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall. Further, International retail business is riding on solid combined order growth.BABA’s strength across the Cainiao logistics services, owing to robust domestic consumer logistics and international fulfillment solution services is a plus. This apart, cloud computing business and local services are acting as tailwinds. Considering these factors, we expect total revenues of BABA to grow 8.2% in fiscal 2024 from fiscal 2023.Zacks Rank #1 Alibaba Group Holding has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.7% and 14.9%, respectively, for the current year (ending March 2024).

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns.

Smith Music School in Nashville.""The premise, since the very beginning, is that children from some of the least advantaged areas of Nashville come in and take music lessons for 50 cents from volunteer teachers,"" said Harless, a longtime wealth advisor. ""Those teachers come from the music industry - many of whom are clients are mine. Or they're retired teachers or members of the (Nashville) Symphony.""As important as the learning is, most of these students come from unfortunate circumstances. So the W.O. Smith Music School becomes a safe place where they have an ally who teaches and encourages them.""William Oscar Smith was a noted African American jazz musician. In 1984, Smith, Music Row executive Buddy Killen and newspaperman Frank Sutherland met to forge a vision for what would become a nonprofit that provides lessons, instruments, sheet music and a future for thousands of Nashville youth.Jonah Rabinowitz has been the executive director of the school since 1995. Trained at the Manhattan School of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music, he still gets excited when the school calendar turns to a new academic year.Each year is different, but what remains the same is exhilarating: being creative, taking chances and opening yourself to new experiences that will change your world.Jonah Rabinowitz""Each year is different, but what remains the same is exhilarating: being creative, taking chances and opening yourself to new experiences that will change your world,"" Rabinowitz said.""But, more than anything, it's about developing trust. We build community, a place where our students feel safe and know they are cared about.""Story continuesRabinowitz pointed out that volunteers commit to weekly lessons for 35 weeks for a minimum of an hour each lesson.""The diversity (of volunteers) is scary in a good way,"" he added. ""We have professional musicians, about 25 percent of our teachers, as well as people who came to Nashville to be musicians or free lancers, then others who moved on to other things. We have a magistrate judge who teaches violin. And we rely on musicians at local colleges. They're closer to the age of students, so they have a similar perspective.""Harless remains a fixture at the school, as well, serving on the advisory council and helping ensure the school's future through fundraisers.""Lisa was not only a fantastic president, but she's also the one you go to when you truly need something because she's there with a solution,"" Rabinowitz. He pointed to a time where they had to hurriedly vacate the original school. ""Before I knew it, I had an office at Regions for two or three months.""For Harless, it's one of many nonprofits she works closely with. But this one will forever be special.""There's purpose here,"" Harless said. ""I've seen how these students are positively impacted for the rest of their lives.""Honoring Life Through ServiceLee and Jeff TaylorExecutive Administrative Assistant for Community Affairs | Head of Commercial Fraud Forensics""The Bell Center was a huge blessing at a time when we didn't know where to turn,"" said Lee Taylor.When Lee and Jeff's son Clay was born with a need for early intervention services at a time when those services were even more scarce than they are today, a friend connected them with The Bell Center, a Homewood, Alabama-based organization dedicated to maximizing the potential of children from birth to three years of age who are at risk for developmental delay.Founder Betty Bell was a family friend, and when Clay's struggles multiplied, she became an extended part of the family and was beside their side at the end.""Betty spent many nights with us at the hospital, and at home,"" Jeff said. ""Her legacy is being fulfilled by the work and service being done by the ladies of the Service Guild of Birmingham and the dedicated staff at the Bell Center.""September is a melancholy moment for Jeff and Lee. It's the month Clay was born and the month he passed away a year later. Lee also lost her mom in September.But their experience has led them to remain involved. Jeff is in his second year on the Bell Center board and Lee continues to support the organization by giving her time and resources.On a recent visit to Unless U, a community organization which fosters the growth of adults with disabilities, Lee ran into a young man she recognized. He had received early intervention services from the Bell Center years earlier when she was a volunteer. He told Lee that he was at Unless U to learn life skills. Lee believes it is because of the services he received when he was young that he is able to live a fuller life today. ""Early intervention can make all the difference in the world,"" she stated.""The Need to help is huge - especially from birth - and there aren't a lot of places that offer the kind of help or early intervention that the Bell Center does,"" Lee said.We support the Bell Center not just for what they did for us but because of what they do for so many other families.""Racing to Build HomesTeresa WalkerAdministrative Assistant with the R2 Transformation TeamTeresa Walker looks back at her time working in Gadsden, Alabama, with a smile.""Without lifting a hammer, I helped build six houses,"" she said.For six of her 10 years, Walker participated in the annual Habitat for Humanity Dragon Boat Festival, plying the Coosa River with 20 friends on various teams, including Rock the Boat Bankers, the Green Oarnets and the Regions Banccaneers.""It's the epitome of team effort and team building because you have to watch your front two oarsmen, match their timing, and everyone has to be in sync. And you only get one practice.""The annual fundraiser is one of this North Alabama city's biggest events due to the numbers of volunteers it produces and the fun that ensues. Each rower must raise $100, so it's a great event for the Habitat team, especially when there are 30-plus teams competing.""In Gadsden, we had the Gadsden Main, Rainbow City and Eastside branches, and we pulled others from branches in Anniston and Centre,"" Walker explained. ""We even had some people come in from Birmingham.It's a great way to get to know each other out of the office, because there's so much more than the race. You set up and decorate the tent, get the refreshments ready and watch all the other races.""And, when you're on the water, it's pretty cool when you get in a rhythm and feel the boat surging forward. And not once did we tip the boat over. That's a good thing!""Sharing the Joy of SuccessKalie StephensSenior Relationship Banker at the Hammond, Louisiana, Main BranchEvery customer is Regions' favorite. But In Hammond, Louisiana, there a few that Kalie Stephens holds near and dear to her heart.""I know all of our OPTIONS customers by name, and most of their caregivers,"" says Stephens.OPTIONS is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to provide people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, daily activities that help them to live and work in the community, build self-esteem and enjoy life.""My best friend's brother and my husband's oldest sister are both disabled. They are both near and dear to my heart, so having an organization that we help support as a bank means the world to me,"" explains Stephens.She looks forward to seeing customers who are in OPTIONS programs visit the branch. ""I love seeing the joy when they come into our branch and talk with all of our associates. Their faces light up when they speak about the special events the organization hosts.""One of my favorite customers recently invited me to go see Ballin' for OPTIONS, when he will be playing in a charity basketball tournament here in Ponchatoula.""Associates in the branch know when OPTIONS customers have events coming up, when they have birthdays, get promotions at work and even when they are elected as officials within OPTIONS organizations.""We share that common joy in watching them succeed in their endeavors.""Hammering for HabitatLaura WithersLoan Servicing Specialist for Real Estate ServicingHow do you make new friends, help a growing family and vent frustrations all in one fell swoop?It's simple. You demolish a house.Withers and her husband moved to Brandon, Mississippi from Georgia last March. Having worked at another bank that had no offices in Greater Jackson, she immediately pivoted to apply to Regions.""I'm from Birmingham originally, so I was already aware of Regions' reputation for being involved in the community and volunteerism,"" Withers said. ""When I got the job, I immediately looked for an opportunity to get involved.""That opportunity would come with a Habitat for Humanity build just 20 minutes away. And since Withers works remotely with teams based in Hattiesburg, it offered a great opportunity to meet her new (and more local) fellow associates in person.""In Georgia, we bought furniture from the Habitat for Humanity store, and I already loved the fact they were a Christian organization.""When we met up, I was the only one that works in the loan operations center. Everyone else I met worked in Treasury Management or as financial advisors in the Jackson area. Most of them had done this with Regions for years. I met some awesome people and got to hear their stories, which only reinforced that I made the right decision.""For this build, the local Habitat organizers bought an abandoned house. So the first order of business was to tear it down to the studs.""The building part is exciting, seeing everything come together,"" she said. ""But the demolishing is fun because I like to bust stuff up with a sledgehammer. But I was so sore the next day, I couldn't lift my shoulders for days.""There were other hardships: the temperature was 100 degrees when they started and 104 when they finished. Then there was an encounter with a backed-up toilet that sent everyone scurrying outside for fresh air.""We were the first to go in,"" she said. ""We tore down cabinets and walls and took out the old appliances. But we probably shouldn't have messed with the toilet.""These stories were sourced from associates who chose to share their answers to the question ""Do you have a story about a community group that Regions supports that made a difference in your life?""

However, American Express’s annual earnings estimates are slightly down over the last quarter making this steep discount less compelling.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWhile not at a far stretched premium to the benchmark, Visa’s stock trades at 26.7X forward earnings and nicely beneath Mastercard’s 32.6X.Furthermore, it's very noteworthy that Visa’s FY23 and FY24 earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last quarter offering further support to its reasonable P/E valuation while Mastercard’s FY23 EPS estimates are slightly down but FY24 estimates are modestly higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAmerican Express stock is certainly compelling in many aspects but currently lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) along with Mastercard shares while Visa’s stock sports a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

V recently teamed up with the well-established security operations provider, Expel, in a bid to equip its global clients to seamlessly detect and alleviate a varied array of cyber threats and therefore, ensure safe money movement across the world.  The initial reach of Expel’s solution will be limited to V’s clients across the United States and Canada, with further plans to introduce it later on a worldwide basis. The cutting-edge Managed Detection and Response (MDR) capabilities of Expel may have prompted Visa to choose it as its partner in countering cybercrimes. The key assets of clients are taken into consideration by the Expel solution and thereby, the identification of cyber vulnerabilities is prioritized. Subsequently, V’s clients will be imparted with enhanced threat detection and response capabilities, which seem to be of dire need amid continuously expanding frauds.Additionally, the clients will gain greater transparency across attack surfaces such as cloud, on-premises, SaaS applications, and Kubernetes. With the help of MDR services informed by external intelligence, trends and threat techniques, customers will need to invest lesser time in investigation of threats. Also, round-the-clock security monitoring and response facilities will be provided as a result of the newly announced collaboration.The recent alliance reflects Visa’s sincere efforts to bolster its internal cybersecurity capabilities and subsequently, upgrade its Risk and Identity Solutions portfolio to help create a more secure ecosystem. Risk and Identity Solutions form a part of V’s Value-Added Services offering suite. Portfolio upgradation often results in attracting new customers and the likewise may happen with Visa, thereby fetching it with higher revenues.The leader in digital payments also has other fraud prevention tools in place, such as Visa Advanced Authorization, Visa Secure, Visa Advanced Identity Score and Visa Consumer Authentication Service solutions, which advance payment security for financial institutions and merchants.Story continuesThe Expel solution may prove to be extremely beneficial for the new and existing clients of Visa across the network, considering a booming digital era across every sphere of life. While digitization does provide comfort and ease, the trend to go digital has led to a rise in cybercrimes. Cyber-attacks often result in the compromise of payments received by organizations and the breach of customer’s confidential data.According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global cybercrime costs are anticipated to reach $8 trillion in 2023 and register 15% annual growth over the next three years. This seems to be an alarming fact for businesses of all sizes. With partnerships similar to the latest one, the urgent need to create a safe payment ecosystem can be rightly taken care of by Visa.Shares of Visa have gained 24.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 18.4% growth. V currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are Shift4 Payments, Inc.

283,63fd50e5-6976-31ff-ae6b-8f699a384967,V,2023-10-04,All You Need to Know About Visa (V) Rating Upgrade to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-visa-v-rating-upgrade-160006256.html,1696348806,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Visa is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Visa imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for VisaThis global payments processor is expected to earn $8.65 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 15.3%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Visa. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.9%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Visa to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

284,54da8950-ebef-3bd6-b25b-bf934315073d,V,2023-10-04,Brokers Suggest Investing in Visa (V): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-visa-v-133006813.html,1696339806,STORY,['V'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Visa (V) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.9% and 17.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Visa, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in V?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $8.65.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Visa may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering Marriott International (MAR), which belongs to the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry.When looking at the last two reports, this hotel company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.78%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Marriott came out with earnings of $2.26 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 per share, representing a surprise of 3.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.86 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 12.37%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Marriott lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marriott currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.59%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Marriott International (MAR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.12 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 2, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.09 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Marriott International has an Earnings ESP of 1.59%.MAR is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ).Slated to report earnings on November 16, 2023, BJ's Wholesale Club holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.96 a share 44 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BJ's Wholesale Club is $0.96, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.48%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MAR and BJ could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company says that starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.The changes will impact any bulk sender, which Google defines as those who send more than 5,000 messages to Gmail addresses in one day. That could include virtually any business with a decently-sized mailing list, from large retailers to big tech companies to even smaller startups and B2C companies or newsletter writers looking to market themselves through email messaging.Google claims that it already leverages AI technology to stop more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware from reaching users' inboxes, and it blocks 15 billion unwanted emails per day. But as technology improves, so must Google's defenses for its now 20-year-old email system.For starters, Gmail will be building on a policy it introduced last year that requires emails sent to Gmail addresses to have some form of authentication to validate that the sender is who they claim to be. This change was necessary because many bulk senders don't properly secure and configure their system, which allows an attacker to ""easily hide in their midst,"" a Google blog post explains. While this reduced the number of unauthenticated messages Gmail users received by 75%, now, Google will require bulk senders to strongly authenticate their emails following a set of documented best practices by February 2024.It will also require bulk senders to allow users to unsubscribe in a single click and for those unsubscribe requests to be processed within two days.Perhaps more controversially, Google will also require bulk senders to stay under a clear spam rate threshold -- something the company notes is an industry first. This means that if enough users are marking a sender's emails as spam, the bulk sender could lose access to users' inboxes.Story continuesWhile Google is announcing the changes in advance of their 2024 arrival, it also notes it's working with industry partners to institute the new policies as well. Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch), is already on board.""No matter who their email provider is, all users deserve the safest, most secure experience possible,"" said Marcel Becker, senior director of Product at Yahoo, in a statement. “In the interconnected world of email, that takes all of us working together. Yahoo looks forward to working with Google and the rest of the email community to make these common sense, high-impact changes the new industry standard,"" he added.Google noted that many bulk senders already meet the new requirements and it will continue to offer clear guidance before the changes go into effect in February 2024.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/gmail-to-enforce-harsher-rules-in-2024-to-keep-spam-from-users-inboxes/]"

This new programming provides an opportunity for girls to develop innovative thinking skills, learn the importance of collaboration and teamwork, explore intellectual curiosity and achieve perseverance through project management and development skills.Stanley Black &amp; Decker advised GSUSA on the development of the Maker badges to ensure unique girl-powered programming for the new badge program. Whether a Girl Scout is interested in painting a still life image, crafting a birdhouse out of milk cartons, or brainstorming how to use solar energy to power a car, there's an activity for everyone through these new badges.The Maker badges include:Art and DesignThrough this badge, Girl Scouts will learn about the basics of art and design and learn how to find inspiration in anything! They'll gain the tools needed to translate the images and ideas in their mind onto a blank page or into a sculpture. Then they'll discover the magic of sharing creative work with others to spread joy.Craft and TinkerThis badge teaches Girl Scouts how to craft new objects to improve their functionality. By tapping into their imagination, Girl Scouts will see that they can make crafts from almost anything, including recycled materials found around their house, by turning milk cartons into paper or using egg cartons as pots for plants. In doing so, they'll learn how to create with users in mind, then ask for feedback from others to further improve their creations.Story continuesCreate and InnovateGirl Scouts have big dreams and ideas they want to bring to life.

All three stocks have helped lead the market’s rebound in 2023, delivering outsized gains. Let’s take a closer look at each.AppleApple has long been known as a cash-generating machine, reporting more than $110 billion in free cash flow throughout its FY22. As of its latest earnings report, the company had $62.5 billion in cash and equivalents.In fact, Apple has regularly been able to boost its dividend payout thanks to its cash-generating nature, currently boasting a 6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares currently yield a respectable 0.6% annually.It’s worth noting that AAPL shares remain relatively expensive, currently trading at a 28.7X forward 12-month earnings multiple. Still, the value is modestly off its 2023 high of 30.1X, and investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s favorable financial standing.TeslaWe’re all familiar with Tesla, the undisputed leader in EVs. The company exited its latest quarter with $23.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up slightly from the end of FY22. In addition, it’s worth noting that the company carries a minimal debt load.The company saw slight negative coverage yesterday following the release of its EV production and delivery numbers.

The wobbly tech markets failed to deter the data analytics firm, as Databricks has been cashing in on the rising popularity of artificial intelligence (AI).""The commitment from long-term focused strategic and financial partners reflects Databricks' continued momentum, the rapid customer adoption of the Databricks Lakehouse, and the success customers are seeing from moving to a unified data and AI platform,"" Databricks Co-Founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi stated in a press release.Don’t Miss:Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O'Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.This startup has already attracted over 1,000 early investors with an impressive 200% year-over-year growth in user engagement. Anyone can get involved.Prior Funding RoundsMore than 50% of all Fortune 500 companies use Databricks' Lakehouse platform, making it one of the most prominent players in the global data analytics space. The platform raised $1.6 billion during its last Series H funding round in 2021, giving the company a $38 billion valuation.The $5 billion rise in valuation over the past two years can be attributed to the issuance of new shares, which were distributed to employees.While some might see Databrick's stagnant valuation growth over the past couple of years as a cause for concern, it is important to note that similar cloud software stocks are grappling with a plummeting valuation. Databricks' biggest rival Snowflake lost nearly 45% of its value over the same period.Story continuesPartnership With NvidiaDatabricks has a long-standing history with Nvidia, as the former uses Nvidia graphic processing units in its software. Nvidia's investment in Databricks came as no surprise.""It made sense to partner more closely,"" Ghodsi said. ""At the core, we're in complementary markets.""""Databricks and Nvidia are building transformative AI technology, and we're excited about the business value and innovation we can bring to our customers,"" Ghodsi said.Databricks' acquisition of MosaicML in June has propelled demand for Nvidia's chips, as enterprise data often forms a stepping stone for generative AI.""Databricks is doing incredible work with Nvidia technology to accelerate data processing and generative AI models,"" Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said.Trending: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This Startup Is Automating The Trillion-Dollar Hospitality Market. AI Startup Looks To Put Airbnb Hosting And Property Management On AutopilotShocking Investment From Capital OneU.S.-based banking holding company Capital One also partook in Databricks' latest funding round last month, despite being the largest customer of Snowflake, one of its biggest competitors.In August 2022, Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli disclosed during an investor event that Capital One was annually allocating nearly $50 million to Snowflake. In November, he reiterated that Capital One is Snowflake's leading customer. Nonetheless, Capital One also employs Databricks technology to detect fraudulent activities or patterns.Robust Growth TrajectoryDatabricks boasts a customer base of more than 10,000 globally, including more than 300 customers generating annual revenue run rates of $1 million or more as of July 31. The firm also unveiled 20 new products and features during its sold-out Data and AI Summit in June.One of Databricks' priorities has been to cut down its costs while maintaining its growth rate. The company's primary cost-cutting avenues have been in technology usage and software subscriptions. This is in sharp contrast to the market view last year, where tech firms were laying off the majority of their workforce to curb their spending levels.""We spent $30 million on 300 pieces of SaaS (software as a service) software,"" Ghodsi said. ""I said, ‘Let's halve that.'""Databricks has experienced significant growth and achievements in the second fiscal quarter of 2023, which ended July 31, with over $1.5 billion in revenue run rate, marking over 50% year-over-year revenue growth. This period also saw the company achieve its highest-ever quarterly incremental revenue growth.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Olin is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Air Products and Chemicals has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that OLN is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.OLN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.73, while APD has a forward P/E of 21.68. We also note that OLN has a PEG ratio of 1.65. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. APD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.12.Another notable valuation metric for OLN is its P/B ratio of 2.49. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, APD has a P/B of 4.03.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to OLN's Value grade of A and APD's Value grade of C.OLN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

For one, according to analysts at HSBC, “We estimate $8 billion in federal stimulus could be unlocked over the next three years (2024-26) to support the U.S. hydrogen industry.” Two, the global hydrogen market could be worth $410.6 billion by 2030 from $242.7 billion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. Three, as I’ve mentioned before, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes the hydrogen market could be worth $1 trillion by 2050. And four, the U.S. Department of Energy just committed $48 million to advance clean hydrogen technologies.That said, investors may want to consider investing in the following hydrogen stocks, which could get quite explosive as the U.S. goes green.Hydrogen Stocks: Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) may not have the most attractive chart just yet, but give it time. At the moment, it’s oversold at double bottom support and was just given a Buy rating by analysts at HSBC, with an $11 price target. The firm noted the company could be at an “inflection point,” as noted by Barron’s. That is, “should sales align with 2023 guidance, as the government allocates more dollars to clean energy and an uptick in liquid hydrogen production lifts profitability at the company.” Even analysts at Jefferies just assumed a Buy rating on the PLUG stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBetter, the company did manage to post record revenues of $260.2 million in the second quarter — up 72% year over year. It even forecasted full-year revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion — all thanks to partnerships. Unfortunately, while revenue has gained momentum, so have costs and operating expenses. While disappointing, it does appear the negativity has been fully priced into the stock.Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (HDRO)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy.

Not only do they allow you to diversify with top names, but they’re also offered at less cost. Look at the Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEARCA:HDRO), for example. With an expense ratio of 0.30%, the ETF tracks the performance of 28 stocks, which generate at least 50% of their revenue from hydrogen-based energy sources.Story continuesSome of its top holdings include Plug Power, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE), Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP), ITM Power (OTCMKTS:ITMPF), and Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) to name a few.

That was on Aug. 11. At the time, I said, “With the negativity priced into the gap, I’d use weakness as an opportunity. For one, APD is now technically oversold on relative strength, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Two, the last time APD became this technically oversold, it bounced from about $270 to $304.”By Sept. 18, APD was up to $307.71. Now, back to $286.70, we’re being offered another opportunity to trade it again. Not only are RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R over-extended again, but the stock is sitting at strong support again.Even better, APD yields 2.44% and recently posted solid earnings. In fact, for its third quarter, the company posted EPS of $2.98, which was 16% year-over-year growth. EBITDA of $1.2 billion was also up 12% year over year. Moving forward, analysts have high expectations for the APD stock thanks to several new projects that should become operational.In short, when it comes to APD, use the weakness as an opportunity. From its current price, I’d like to see the stock initially retest $307.50 again soon.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

309,3c18a2a1-dee7-3f68-92a7-82ba1216a51f,DIS,2023-10-04,Why Netflix is reportedly looking to raise prices for ad-free tier,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-netflix-reportedly-looking-raise-212729609.html,1696368449,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'DIS', 'WBD']","[Netflix (NFLX) is considering raising the price of its ad-free plan after the SAG-AFTRA strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other streamers such as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS), have raised the prices of their ad-free tiers. Third Bridge Analyst Jamie Lumley joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the latest on Netflix and where the price hikes could start.“On the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive,” Lumley says. As Netflix thinks “about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position, price hikes is one way to really do that.”Lumley notes that streamers are finding increased value “in driving people to the ad-supported tiers.” Ad-supported plans for a lot of streamers have not increased in price so “by raising the price on the ad-free, they’re hoping they can drive further traffic there,” Lumley states.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Another company that we're watching today in a story we're following is Netflix, reportedly eyeing further price hikes for its ad-free platform following the conclusion of the actor's strike, whenever that happens. According to the Wall Street Journal, the streamer is discussing hikes in several markets globally, but will likely begin with the United States and Canada.With more on this is James Lumley, sector analyst at Third Bridge Group. Obviously, Jamie, we don't know when the strike is going to end. But what kind of pricing power do you think Netflix has?JAMES LUMLEY: It's a great question. And thanks for having me on today. As we look at the news today regarding whether or not Netflix will be raising these prices at the conclusion of the actors' strike, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. One, if we just first look at as the why that they're doing this, on the backs of the writers' strike finishing, whenever the actors' strike finishes, content prices will likely be more expensive as Netflix really thinks about their balance sheet, they think about their underlying profitability, finding a way to really strengthen their position. Price hikes is one way to really do that.Story continuesAnother thing is just also something we've been hearing from our experts for a while now and is the increasing value in driving people to the ad-supported tiers. Most of the ad-supported tiers for Netflix and competitors alike have not seen prices be shifted in the last year or so. So by raising the price on the ad-free, they're hoping they can drive further traffic there as basically the underlying economics are increasingly attractive on the ad tier.When it comes to pricing pressure, we know certainly Netflix is often viewed as one of the leader in this industry, the early mover, the only profitable streaming company. So what they can command on pricing is definitely an interesting question. By and large, they are viewed as one of the key platforms by consumers to keep when they're looking through which platforms are worth their time, which ones are seeing high engagement, but necessarily how much that will translate in their ability to raise prices from where they are now remains to be seen.- And Jamie, let's say they roll this out, they raise prices. Where do you think they would do that, Jamie? What geographies? I mean, do you think that would be US? Do you think it would be Europe? Do you think it'd be both?JAMES LUMLEY: It's a good question. If we look at where they might do this, it might be good to draw some parallels to where they first experimented with the rollout of password sharing or the crackdown on password sharing because what we've heard from our experts is Netflix is incredibly deliberate when it rolls out something new, it tries to put in changes, to make sure that this doesn't have any negative impacts on its most important markets. For the password sharing, they initially had a crackdown in South America, then in Canada, before being rolled out in the US and other major markets.But for this, on the flip side, if this is an effective way, does not drive increased churn from Netflix, rolling it out in some of those larger markets will have the largest impact, as Netflix looks to either further strengthen its positioning with increased content costs or just to really see the most traffic driven to the ad-supported tier. They could very well try that in some of the larger markets like the US or Europe.]"

The company declined to comment on the report when asked by Yahoo Finance.SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world, is currently engaged in contract negotiations with studios, and a deal could be imminent.Although the Journal said the exact timeline for a potential Netflix price hike and the amount by which its monthly $15.49 plan would go up is still unknown, the rumored increase echoes recent moves by competitors.Streaming prices rival cable bundleWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which raised the price of its ad-free Max offering earlier this year by $1 to $15.99, announced that it would raise the price of its ad-free Discovery+ streaming platform by $2 to $8.99, effective Tuesday.The ad-free versions of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will rise by more than 20% effective Oct. 12 as Disney (DIS) works to narrow its direct-to-consumer losses and reach streaming profitability by the end of its fiscal 2024. It's the second time this year that Disney has raised the prices of its plans.Meanwhile Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) upped the cost of its ad-supported plan by $1 to $5.99 and its ad-free plan by $2 to $11.99 in August. It was the first time Peacock had raised its streaming prices.In June, Paramount (PARA) launched its Paramount+ with Showtime streaming offering for $11.99 a month — $2 more than the previous price for a Paramount+ subscription. It also raised the prices of its ad-supported tier by $1 to $5.99.Even cable replacement services like Alphabet's YouTube TV (GOOGL) and Disney's Hulu + Live TV have seen prices leap from prior levels.Story continuesYouTube TV jumped to $72.99 from $64.99 in March while Hulu + Live TV with ads will see prices increase from $69.99 to $76.99 next week. The ad-free version will cost $89.99, up from the prior $82.99.Netflix, the only profitable streaming service on the market, remains the sole platform that hasn't raised prices this year, choosing to focus on revenue initiatives like the crackdown on password sharing and its recently launched ad-supported tier instead.On Tuesday, the company announced an executive shakeup within its advertising unit with Jeremi Gorman, who helped build the ad business from scratch, exiting the company after just over a year in the job. Amy Reinhard, who previously served as VP of studio operations, will succeed Gorman as the new president of advertising.Netflix also announced Eunice Kim will be promoted to chief product officer while Elizabeth Stone will serve as chief technology officer.The leadership changes come as Netflix revamps the company for its next stage of growth with pricing top of mind amid the competitive landscape.The company last hiked prices in early 2022, bumping its Standard plan to $15.49 from $13.99 and increasing the cost of its Premium plan to $19.99 from $17.99. However, Netflix did quietly remove its ""Basic"" $9.99 plan in July — a bid to lure more users to its cheaper, $6.99 ad-based offering.Streaming prices have ballooned across the board with Netflix the latest platform that will reportedly raise prices as profitability and engagement become top of mind for media companies. (Getty Images)Added up, the cost of these services now rival the dreaded cable TV bundle of years past — the very thing that streaming set out to undo.Consumers are taking notice with subscribers canceling more of their plans to combat rising costs.Subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined following this latest earnings season.Despite the overall slowdown, growth was aided by Netflix's password sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter with more users signing up for their own plans. Wider crackdowns on password sharing will likely become the norm as media giants prioritize profitability over subscriber count.Disney said it would be implementing its own crackdown at some point in 2024.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

314,63c2be42-9ad4-3ead-a8f4-1d540a743ce1,DIS,2023-10-04,Netflix considers raising price of ad-free tier: Report,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-considers-raising-price-ad-163136751.html,1696350696,VIDEO,"['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'WBD']","[Netflix (NFLX) is considering raising prices for its ad-free streaming plan after the conclusion of the Hollywood actors' strike, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal details the streaming service's price hike decision, examining rising subscription costs in the streaming space over the past decade.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Netflix is reportedly eyeing further price hikes for its ad-free platform following the conclusion of the actor's strike. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us with the details. Allie, more pricing-- more pricing increases. We're struggling here.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, it's another day, another announcement that probably we're going to get more price increases for these streaming services. Now, the Wall Street Journal says that Netflix plans to do this a few months after the conclusion of the actor's strike. The Actors Guild SAG-AFTRA is currently in ongoing negotiations with studios, so we could see the end to that strike relatively soon, especially on the heels of the writers strike conclusion. But ultimately TBD when these price hikes would hit and by how much those prices would go up by.The Wall Street Journal said there are discussions to raise prices in several territories around the globe, that it would first start in the US and Canada. And like you've said, we've seen these price increases across the board. Just about 20 minutes ago, Warner Brothers Discovery revealed that Discovery+, the monthly price for that ad free plan will be going up by $2 to $8.99 a month, up from the prior $6.99.The ad-free versions of Hulu, ESPN+, and Disney+ will also go up next week. And this is coming as companies are racing towards profitability. Netflix is the only profitable streaming service out there and is the only streaming service so far this year to not raise prices. That last price hike came in January of 2022. But according to this report, we're going to see it come very soon.But besides just profitability, engagement has been really important, and that's why we're seeing a lot of streamers really lean on sports and really utilizing that opportunity to offer different types of tiers to get more people to subscribe to the platform and pay different types of amounts. So Max is going to unveil its sports tier on Thursday. That's going to be free to subscribers until March of 2024 where then it will be an add-on cost of $10 a month.Disney+ is reportedly looking at a sports option as well, which would be outside of ESPN+. We have Apple reportedly looking at the rights to F1, so sports has become really a big driver to try and increase that stickiness for those subscribers and the consumers. So we'll see where all this leads, but ultimately, unfortunately, that just means more prices that we, the consumer, are going to have to cough up at the end of the day.]"

316,bd5e5be8-e924-3516-85d0-3ccbcc937905,DIS,2023-10-04,How Disney turned Halloween into a money-making machine,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-turned-halloween-money-making-160805294.html,1696349285,STORY,['DIS'],"[For devoted Disney fans, there’s often no better treat than spending Halloween at its theme parks — and more specifically, at its after-hours parties, where visitors can trick-or-treat through Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room and watch a Halloween-exclusive parade, among other experiences.But tickets are neither cheap nor easy to acquire. The parties are held on multiple nights throughout the season, and the version at Disney’s California resort, the “Oogie Boogie Bash,” is so popular that the 2023 event sold out the first day tickets went on sale. Fans reported trouble with virtual queues and website crashes.Florida’s version is Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, and it’s so in demand that the first night of the 38-night 2023 party was held on Aug. 11. That date is closer to July Fourth than to Halloween.Tickets to Disneyland’s California party went for as much as $189, while tickets to the Florida version at Walt Disney World can cost about $210 on some nights.Holding a party ticket doesn’t even gain access to the parks in the morning. Since party tickets only allow entry as early as mid-afternoon, a separate theme park ticket (which typically costs over $100) is necessary for those who want to spend the whole day inside the parks.For cost-conscious Disney visitors, the real fright is how prices have crept up every year since these parties began.DISNEY’S HALLOWEEN PARTY HISTORYDisney started with small-scale Halloween festivities. In 1959, Disneyland had a pumpkin-carving contest. In 1979, Walt Disney World hosted a party featuring musical performances by popular artists, which was ticketed separately from traditional theme park entry.But things didn’t take off until 1995, when Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom theme park hosted a Halloween night party, which has since morphed into the annual tradition that today is a sold-out, multimonth palooza.Tickets for 1995’s after-hours event were $16.95 (about $34 in today’s dollars), according to historian Jim Hill. By 2005, the event’s run had grown to 15 nights, with ticket prices doubling to $37, according to Disney fan site AllEars — but that’s still just $57 in today’s dollars.Story continuesWhen adjusted for inflation, tickets for today’s Halloween party at Disney World are 469% more expensive than 2005’s prices.HALLOWEEN IS A HUGE HOLIDAY FOR DISNEYHalloween likely is a big revenue generator for Disney, according to outside calculations. Len Testa, president of Disney vacation planning website TouringPlans, estimates that Disney’s Halloween party in Florida alone generates about $3.3 million in revenue for the company per night (and about $125 million across the season). And because the parties are held after-hours, Disney also is able to sell theme park entry tickets.“This after-hours party is Disney’s way of selling admission to the same park, on the same day, twice,” he says.Even if travelers don’t pay extra for the after-hours party, Disney makes additional revenue on themed merchandise and food in the parks during the day. There’s a paid pumpkin scavenger hunt at California’s Downtown Disney District and limited-time food, like Mickey-shaped pumpkin cheesecake and ghost pepper nachos.Disney’s ornate Halloween popcorn buckets are so popular that Disney limits sales for certain designs to two per person. Plus, fans clamoring for Halloween merchandise might even pick them up on the resale market. Popcorn buckets that retail for about $30 (including popcorn) in the parks can sometimes sell for more than $100 on resale websites — and that’s not including the popcorn.COMPETITORS FOLLOW SUITNearby tourist attractions have carved out their own opportunities to cash in on Halloween. For example, Pirates Dinner Adventure runs a “Vampirates” show in Orlando, Florida. Both SeaWorld in Orlando and San Diego host two Halloween-themed events: the family-friendly SeaWorld Spooktacular and the intentionally terrifying Howl-O-Scream nighttime event. Orlando even brands itself the “Halloween Vacation Capital.”But competitors generally don’t charge as much as Disney — nor do their tickets sell out as quickly. Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood operates similarly to Disney, where visitors purchase a separate party ticket to the event, and it still has plenty of tickets available. Universal tickets cost far less, with peak nights commanding $114, which is about 40% cheaper than Disneyland’s priciest ticket. Tickets run as low as $74 on some nights.WHY HALLOWEEN HITS DISNEY’S SWEET SPOTFor fans of Disney’s after-hours Halloween parties, the main draw isn’t usually the rides (though shorter wait times can be alluring).Instead, many visitors come for trick-or-treating, party-exclusive parades and unique photo-ops.The costumed characters are wildly popular, too. That includes meeting Mickey Mouse dressed up in Halloween garb, plus rare or new characters. The Oogie Boogie Bash has an entire section devoted to rarely-seen villains, including Madam Mim from “The Sword in the Stone.” According to TouringPlans.com, wait times to meet Jack and Sally from “The Nightmare Before Christmas” have exceeded four hours.For trick-or-treating, Testa says there’s no better spot than Disney. Visitors are given trick-or-treat bags that he says can hold four pounds of candy.“They hand out candy with garden trowels,” he says. “You’re getting fistfuls of chocolate at each stop.”The fact that the parties run during shoulder season is also potentially advantageous, offering travelers lower hotel and flight prices, plus cooler weather versus the summer.“There are low crowds this time of year,” Testa says. “You get the special Halloween party one night, and shorter waits for rides during the day. It’s a compelling value proposition.”_________________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

In August 2023, Duke Energy teamed up with General Motors, Ford Motor Company and BMW of North America to roll out a flat fee residential charging subscription pilot.DUK’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is pegged at 6.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an increase of 1.3% over 2022’s reported figure.Entergy’s Electric Technology Program provides incentives to purchase EVs and charging infrastructure. The EV program provides information on choices, economic considerations and the benefits of the same. In September 2023, Entergy partnered with First Student, the largest school transportation company in North America, to pilot the first vehicle-to-grid project inside its service territory.ETR’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.7%.

""The expansion of Midwest’s largest public EV charging hub at Millennium Garages complements the City’s ongoing efforts to build out EV infrastructure and will help make going electric a more convenient option for Chicago’s residents and visitors.""""IACT encourages the use of clean fuel vehicles, clean fuels, and advanced vehicle technologies to promote cleaner air, improve the environment, energy efficiencies, domestic and renewable fuels, and a reduction in the use of imported petroleum,"" said John Walton, Chair of Illinois Alliance for Clean Transportation (IACT). ""Millennium Garages’ EV charging program and the collaboration with ComEd to expand electrification across northern Illinois will play a role in helping us to achieve all of the above.""EV charging at Millennium Garages follows ComEd’s ongoing work across the region as they develop solutions to electrify fleet vehicles and embrace cleaner technologies. To accelerate EV adoption and to help more customers achieve their sustainability goals, ComEd recently announced a $231 million investment in electrification, with plans for new rebates, rates and pilot studies to help more customers move toward EVs and higher efficiency technology upgrades, like heat pumps, at home.""The commitment today by Millennium Garages and ComEd serves as a great model in how we can leverage our parking infrastructure to decarbonize in a way that provides real benefit to all,"" said Brian Imus, Executive Director of the Illinois Green Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes green building technology and design.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.92bUS$3.24bUS$3.48bUS$3.69bUS$3.87bUS$4.02bUS$4.16bUS$4.28bUS$4.40bUS$4.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Est @ 7.48%Est @ 5.88%Est @ 4.76%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.7kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$28bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$115bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$115b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$64bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$91b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$70.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

He suggested there might even be a rate hike by the end of 2024.His words were more than a solace for longs in commodities and equities, desperate for a break from the fear factor of a super hawkish Fed that has gripped the investing world again after a respite in the second quarter. Coming ahead of a widely expected rate hike in either November or December — and after September’s pause — it was a sign the central bank might be done with new increases, after its 11 hikes between March 2022 and July 2023.Bostic also helped offset an utterly bearish mood that gripped markets shortly after the Labor Department reported earlier on Tuesday that the number of job openings in the United States rose more than expected in August, chipping away at some of the confidence the Fed may have had in its fight against inflation.An estimated 9.61 million jobs opened up in August, according to the Labor Department's latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report. In July, there were just 8.92 million openings. Wall Street economists' consensus for August job openings were just around 8.8 million.The JOLTS report came ahead of the more important September non-farm payrolls  report scheduled for release on Friday. The Fed will be watching that closely to help steer its decision on rates. The central bank has repeatedly said that jobs and wage growth have to cool in order to moderate inflation.Story continuesWTI needs to go well above $91 for rebound to gain steam; OPEC meet awaitedNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November settled at $89.23 per barrel, up 41 cents, or 0.5%. The US crude benchmark hit a three-week low of $87.77 earlier, after losing more than 5% over three prior sessions.“WTI’s decline paused at around the $86 horizontal support and is beginning to show some recovery to $90,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. “Short term, however, a decisive breakout well above $91 will be required to give the rebound steam.”London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract settled at $90.92, up 21 cents, or 0.2%. The global crude benchmark plunged to a three-week low of $89.56 earlier, after losing more than 6% in three previous days of trading.Aside from Bostic’s messaging on rates, crude prices were also supported by news of a further delay in efforts to restart Iraqi oil exports via a Turkish pipeline and expectations that producer OPEC+ at its meeting on Wednesday would say something supportive for longs in the game.“Today was more a borrowed fundamentals day for oil, with the slightly dovish outlook on rates from Bostic tempering some of the might in yields and the dollar that had been clobbering risk markets for days on end,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Market participants were also on the lookout for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Sept. 29. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile build of 0.05 million barrels, versus the 2.170M barrel drop reported during the prior week to Sept. 22.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 0.3M barrels over the 1.027M-barrel build in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a decline of 0.068M, versus the prior week’s gain of 0.398M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Related ArticlesOil up as Fed’s Bostic hints at another hold on rates and likely 2024 cut US crude stocks down 4.2M barrels; Gasoline up 3.9M, Cushing builds too - APIOil rebounds from 3-week low, settles up despite stronger dollar]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns.

The company declined to comment on the report when asked by Yahoo Finance.SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world, is currently engaged in contract negotiations with studios, and a deal could be imminent.Although the Journal said the exact timeline for a potential Netflix price hike and the amount by which its monthly $15.49 plan would go up is still unknown, the rumored increase echoes recent moves by competitors.Streaming prices rival cable bundleWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which raised the price of its ad-free Max offering earlier this year by $1 to $15.99, announced that it would raise the price of its ad-free Discovery+ streaming platform by $2 to $8.99, effective Tuesday.The ad-free versions of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ will rise by more than 20% effective Oct. 12 as Disney (DIS) works to narrow its direct-to-consumer losses and reach streaming profitability by the end of its fiscal 2024. It's the second time this year that Disney has raised the prices of its plans.Meanwhile Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) upped the cost of its ad-supported plan by $1 to $5.99 and its ad-free plan by $2 to $11.99 in August. It was the first time Peacock had raised its streaming prices.In June, Paramount (PARA) launched its Paramount+ with Showtime streaming offering for $11.99 a month — $2 more than the previous price for a Paramount+ subscription. It also raised the prices of its ad-supported tier by $1 to $5.99.Even cable replacement services like Alphabet's YouTube TV (GOOGL) and Disney's Hulu + Live TV have seen prices leap from prior levels.Story continuesYouTube TV jumped to $72.99 from $64.99 in March while Hulu + Live TV with ads will see prices increase from $69.99 to $76.99 next week. The ad-free version will cost $89.99, up from the prior $82.99.Netflix, the only profitable streaming service on the market, remains the sole platform that hasn't raised prices this year, choosing to focus on revenue initiatives like the crackdown on password sharing and its recently launched ad-supported tier instead.On Tuesday, the company announced an executive shakeup within its advertising unit with Jeremi Gorman, who helped build the ad business from scratch, exiting the company after just over a year in the job. Amy Reinhard, who previously served as VP of studio operations, will succeed Gorman as the new president of advertising.Netflix also announced Eunice Kim will be promoted to chief product officer while Elizabeth Stone will serve as chief technology officer.The leadership changes come as Netflix revamps the company for its next stage of growth with pricing top of mind amid the competitive landscape.The company last hiked prices in early 2022, bumping its Standard plan to $15.49 from $13.99 and increasing the cost of its Premium plan to $19.99 from $17.99. However, Netflix did quietly remove its ""Basic"" $9.99 plan in July — a bid to lure more users to its cheaper, $6.99 ad-based offering.Streaming prices have ballooned across the board with Netflix the latest platform that will reportedly raise prices as profitability and engagement become top of mind for media companies. (Getty Images) (Wachiwit via Getty Images)Added up, the cost of these services now rival the dreaded cable TV bundle of years past — the very thing that streaming set out to undo.Consumers are taking notice with subscribers canceling more of their plans to combat rising costs.Subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max, and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined following this latest earnings season.Despite the overall slowdown, growth was aided by Netflix's password sharing crackdown, which helped the streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter with more users signing up for their own plans. Wider crackdowns on password sharing will likely become the norm as media giants prioritize profitability over subscriber count.Disney said it would be implementing its own crackdown at some point in 2024.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

330,2545e625-83d7-3de6-8cfa-5267e8bdc1a8,DVN,2023-10-04,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-devon-energy-130011238.html,1696338011,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -13.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 7.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.69 points to a change of -31.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 indicates a change of +18.8% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -26.7%. The $15.39 billion and $16.21 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.7% and +5.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $3.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.6%. EPS of $1.18 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.23%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Further, 53% of executives stated that they face budgeting issues when it comes to implementing innovative solutions. However, 95% of respondents are still turning to innovation to mitigate macro risks.The findings suggest that even in today’s challenging economic environment, U.S. executives still prefer to combat risk by augmenting their competitiveness through innovation:The most common innovation strategy was technology and systems innovation, cited by 60% of executives.55% of those leaders cited becoming more competitive as the reason to pursue innovation in their technology and systems.Meanwhile, 53% of surveyed leaders reported that they’re pursuing artificial intelligence (AI) to be more competitive, and 52% are pursuing generative AI tools to be more competitive.149% reported the pursuit of embedded finance capabilities to improve their competitiveness, and 49% reported competitiveness as their reason for pursuing open banking capabilities.Story continues""U.S. financial services firms have been leading the charge in adopting innovative technology to enhance security, customer experience and overall competitiveness,"" said John Durrant, Banking Solutions President at FIS. ""Now, as the findings in this report suggest, business leaders everywhere are shifting from a ‘wait-and-see’ approach to a deliberate investment and experimentation strategy. FIS believes this trend will continue as automation and AI pose unique opportunities to streamline operations and enhance customer service while future-proofing against competitors who are diving into digital head first.""The report also sought to explore the variables that are impeding executives’ ability to implement innovative solutions in response to their respective risks. While budget constraints were the top reported issue with 48% of firms experiencing it, a large portion of U.S. respondents also expressed internal struggles that pertain to talent and infrastructure.The talent gap and a change-resistant culture are putting pressure on industry leaders who seek to proactively mitigate risk through technology:50% of firms reported a lack of in-house expertise/knowledge.49% reported resistance to change among employees.48% reported a lack of internal technology and/or data.44% reported a resistance to change among top management.""While the adoption of emerging technology is key for growth, leaders must double-down on closing the talent gap in tech in order to realize the full potential of their investments,"" added Durrant. ""As leaders lean on internal talent to help digitally transform their organizations, it is critical that it comes with a focus on up-skilling and building a culture of innovation that has employees rallying around change instead of running from it. Meanwhile, companies can close the skills gap faster by finding the right partners that can help them launch the innovative capabilities they seek.""About the FIS Global Innovation Report ResearchFIS’ Global Innovation Report surveyed more than 2,000 business leaders around the world.

BrandsTaco Bell BlogNational Hispanic/Latin Heritage Month, which runs from September 15 to October 15, is dedicated to showcasing the brilliant Hispanic/Latin culture. These grand celebrations include art exhibitions, music performances, parades, street fairs and more!The observation started on September 15, 1968 as a weeklong celebration and expanded in 1988 to a monthlong commemoration. But why September 15? This date is the anniversary of the independence days shared by Latin American countries Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, also falling close to Mexico and Chile's independence days on September 16 and September 18.To honor this momentous month, we're spotlighting members of the Hispanic/Latin community and their inspiring career and life journeys.David P. (he/him/his) - Manager, Global OperationsDavid, manager of global operations, has been with Yum! Brands since 1989... you could say he has seen it all. David currently leads the implementation of critical operations projects and programs that facilitate the growth of Taco Bell around the world. However, he first got his start with chicken, not tacos!""Born in Mexico, I first moved to United States as a toddler, but returned home six years later to complete elementary and middle school in my native country. I relocated to the U.S. again at age 15 where I joined KFC the following year as a cook, hand-breading and frying the Original Recipe chicken.""Over the next couple of years, David held a series of roles including cashier, shift lead, assistant manager and restaurant GM at KFC. He then transferred to the Taco Bell Restaurant Support Center in 1999, supporting the service desk and working in data and project management, which led him to his current position. It wasn't long before Taco Bell became a second home to him.""For many long-term employees like me, working at Taco Bell can become a part of our identity. We often develop a sense of pride and loyalty toward the company due to the experiences, skills, and friendships we have gained over time,"" said David.Story continuesAlongside building close relationships and embracing the fiery spirit of Taco Bell, David has seen an upward career trajectory amongst peers and his own journey.""Taco Bell offers various opportunities for career growth and skill development. Some employees start from entry-level positions and work their way up the ladder, eventually becoming managers or even franchise owners.""He's been a proud part of the growth process, but it's not come short of some obstacles.""As a Hispanic/Latin individual, I have faced stereotypes and challenges, but focusing on my own strengths, accomplishments, and expertise to challenge these preconceptions has helped me overcome them.""These instances have made David's connection to his heritage even stronger. To him, Hispanic/Latin Heritage Month celebrates the rich cultural diversity, contributions, and achievements of Hispanic and Latin Americans. Amongst the vibrant events, gatherings and affairs, Hispanic/Latin Heritage Month serves as a valuable time for reflection and appreciation of the culture and its notable impact on various aspects of society. Over the years, David has seen this awareness come to life through Taco Bell's involvement within the community.""Taco Bell's initiatives of highlighting our community and culture has taken a bigger stage than before. I am very excited and honored to share that I'm a founding member of Live Más LUCHA, Taco Bell's first-ever Hispanic Business Employee Resource Group (BERG) which launched in 2020.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Paccar (PCAR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.13 a share, just 21 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.06 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Paccar has an Earnings ESP of 3.34%.PCAR is one of just a large database of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Ferrari (RACE).Slated to report earnings on November 2, 2023, Ferrari holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.69 a share 30 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ferrari is $1.64, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.26%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, PCAR and RACE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

However, American Express’s annual earnings estimates are slightly down over the last quarter making this steep discount less compelling.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWhile not at a far stretched premium to the benchmark, Visa’s stock trades at 26.7X forward earnings and nicely beneath Mastercard’s 32.6X.Furthermore, it's very noteworthy that Visa’s FY23 and FY24 earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last quarter offering further support to its reasonable P/E valuation while Mastercard’s FY23 EPS estimates are slightly down but FY24 estimates are modestly higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAmerican Express stock is certainly compelling in many aspects but currently lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) along with Mastercard shares while Visa’s stock sports a Zack Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Industry: Concrete &amp; AggregatesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2159147/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-promising-concrete-aggregates-industryA boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act collectively signify a substantial commitment to bolstering American competitiveness. These three recently enacted laws are aimed at revitalizing American infrastructure, expediting the shift toward a sustainable economy, and fortifying the domestic semiconductor sector.Story continuesThese bills comprise new investments in almost every infrastructure sector, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #107, which places it in the top 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates impressive near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since June 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased 9.6% and 7.3% to $2.06 and $2.34 per share, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 30.6% versus the broader sector’s rise of 30% over the past year.

361,a4b7fc75-5293-3796-811b-efd086524d00,MLM,2023-10-04,3 Stocks to Watch From the Promising Concrete & Aggregates Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-promising-concrete-154600241.html,1696347960,STORY,"['MLM', 'VMC', 'SUM', '^GSPC']","[A boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act collectively signify a substantial commitment to bolstering American competitiveness. These three recently enacted laws are aimed at revitalizing American infrastructure, expediting the shift toward a sustainable economy, and fortifying the domestic semiconductor sector. These bills comprise new investments in almost every infrastructure sector, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector.

This comprehensive approach ensures that Petrobras receives not only top-quality products but also the necessary support to ensure project success.Story continuesBenefits of Flexible Pipes for Pre-Salt FieldsFlexible pipes are particularly well-suited for use in the pre-salt fields for a number of reasons. First, they are able to withstand the high pressures and temperatures that are found in these fields. Second, they are flexible and can be easily installed in complex subsea environments. Third, they have a long service life and require minimal maintenance.The Pre-Salt ChallengeThe pre-salt fields, located deep beneath the ocean floor, are known for their impressive productivity but present unique challenges due to their extraordinary depth and complexity.

364,534a0825-336e-3dfc-a1d9-246ad5100286,RMD,2023-10-04,Here's Why Investors Should Retain ResMed (RMD) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-resmed-125600247.html,1696337760,STORY,"['RMD', 'HAE']","[ResMed Inc. RMD is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the strength of the respiratory care business, led by the ongoing adoption of non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilator solutions. Progress made in terms of several digital health technology initiatives garners appreciation. The company is also well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for outside hospital care globally.However, ResMed’s balance sheet is burdened with high debt, which is concerning. The unfavorable impacts of global macroeconomic conditions may also affect the company’s results of operations.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 36% compared with the 0.5% decline of the industry and a 16.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $21.75 billion. RMD has an earnings yield of 4.75% against the industry’s yield of -1.61%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, matched once and missed in another quarter. It has an average earnings surprise of 1.64%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesRespiratory Care Products Continue to Flourish: ResMed’s respiratory care business continues to drive growth and the adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions worldwide. The company is investing in newer-to-market technologies for patients, including home-based high-flow therapy for treating a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD at home.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough still early for market development, ResMed continues to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support the broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease at home. Given the high incidence of respiratory insufficiency due to COPD and neuromuscular disease, ResMed aims to develop low-cost, high-quality solutions to address this health epidemic.Potential in Digital Health: ResMed is leading the market in digital health technology, with more than 15.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and nearly 21.5 million cloud-connectable medical devices on people's bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide.Story continuesIn the coming quarters, the company is introducing several artificial intelligence-driven coaching features in the AirView system and on the myAir app. These AI-driven data products will provide personalized suggestions to increase patient therapy adherence and ultimately improve patient outcomes.Strategic Pacts to Boost the SaaS Business: The company tends to opt for strategic buyouts to boost SaaS revenues. The Brightree ReSupply program continues to demonstrate synergies between the SaaS business and the core SRC business. The Home Medical Equipment (“HME”) SaaS business under the Brightree brand is growing at a very rapid pace.MEDIFOX DAN is surpassing the company’s initial expectations with an accelerated contribution. Investing in the leading German healthcare is synonymous with ResMed’s vision of lower-cost, lower-acuity and highest-quality outcome care for patients. ResMed’s recent acquisition of Somnoware complements its current ecosystem of software solutions, including AirView for providers and physicians and Brightree for home care providers.DownsidesEscalating Debt Level: The company’s high debt level remains a concern. As of Jun 30, 2023, the long-term debt was $1.43 billion, while the cash and cash equivalent balance was only $228 million. A higher debt level induces higher interest payments, which come along with the risk of failure to pay the same.A Challenging Macroeconomic Scenario: Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply-chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and volatility in capital markets could continue to adversely affect RMD’s results of operations.  A decline in the global economic environment may reduce the demand for the company’s products, resulting in lower sales, lower product prices and reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payers while increasing the cost of operating the business.Apart from these impacts, ResMed’s gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was further affected by the lower-than-expected product mix benefit.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RMD’s fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has moved down from $7.07 to $7.03 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $4.65 billion, up 10.04% from the year-ago reported figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Align Technology ALGN and Quanterix QTRX.Haemonetics has an estimated earnings growth rate of 26.1% in fiscal 2024 compared with the industry’s 18.7%. HAE’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%. Its shares have rallied 16.2% against the industry’s 0.5% fall in the past year.HAE carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

MDLZ has been focused on reshaping its portfolio. The company concluded the divestiture of its developed-market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe (excluding Portugal) to Perfetti Van Melle Group.As of now, Mondelez will keep the portion of the business in Portugal until it receives regulatory approval in that jurisdiction. Following the approval, the Portuguese part of the business will be offloaded and transferred to Perfetti Van Melle Group, which is a global gum and confectionery company.The divestiture marks another step toward MDLZ’s commitment to strengthening its core categories, including chocolates, biscuits and baked snacks. Mondelez aims to generate 90% of its revenues from these core categories.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInside the HeadlinesThe divestiture encompasses the Rockford, Illinois and Skarbimierz and Poland manufacturing facilities as well as gum brands, including Trident, Dentyne, Stimorol, Chiclets, Bubbaloo, Hollywood, V6 and Bubbalicious in the United States, Europe and Canada. Additionally, the divestiture includes European candy brands like Cachou Lajaunie and La Vosgienne.However, Mondelez will continue to run its gum business outside the United States, Canada and Europe, led by Stride in China, alongside all other candy brands and products.This deal goes in tandem with Perfetti’s goal of becoming a worldwide leader in the gum industry. As for Mondelez, the sale of the developed-market gum business to Perfetti helps the company in its pursuit of becoming a major player in the global snacking space (especially chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks).Focus on Core CategoriesMondelez has been expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.The company’s core chocolate and biscuit categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2023. Management is focused on expanding these categories as they have considerable scope for growth (in terms of penetration and per capita consumption). On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects solid volume momentum for both these categories as it moves forward in 2023.Mondelez expects 2023 organic net revenue growth of more than 12%.

Studies have shown that by 2050 roughly half the land currently used to grow coffee could be unproductive thanks to climate change.""Coffee is causing deforestation at a pretty alarming rate - almost up to ten (New York) Central Parks a day,"" said Atomo's CEO and co-founder Andy Kleitsch ahead of the firm's beanless coffee launch at the New York Coffee Festival on Friday.""We're talking about a machine, a coffee machine that's never stopping, always looking for more land, and that's what we're trying to prevent,"" he said.Atomo says its initial ""proof-of-concept"" cold brew beanless coffee caused 93% fewer carbon emissions and used 94% less water than regular coffee. Time Magazine named it one of the 200 best inventions of 2022.The firm expects to see similar figures for its new hot beanless coffee which is also made using mostly upcycled ingredients like date pips, which tend to be discarded in the commercial production process.Story continuesAtomo is initially targeting coffee shops as opposed to stores and supermarket chains as its roasted coffee will wholesale for $20.99 per lb, versus the $10-14 per lb paid by the average U.S. coffee shop.After rapid initial growth, some manufacturers of meat alternatives have struggled more recently as inflation-hit shoppers cut back on their often pricier products.However, Atomo says it is in talks with most of the world's major coffee firms about how it might scale up and supply them.""They (coffee majors) all know they have a problem with coffee availability in next 20-30 years, and they're trying to get ahead of the problem,"" said Kleitsch.

Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O'Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.This startup has already attracted over 1,000 early investors with an impressive 200% year-over-year growth in user engagement. Anyone can get involved.Prior Funding RoundsMore than 50% of all Fortune 500 companies use Databricks' Lakehouse platform, making it one of the most prominent players in the global data analytics space. The platform raised $1.6 billion during its last Series H funding round in 2021, giving the company a $38 billion valuation.The $5 billion rise in valuation over the past two years can be attributed to the issuance of new shares, which were distributed to employees.While some might see Databrick's stagnant valuation growth over the past couple of years as a cause for concern, it is important to note that similar cloud software stocks are grappling with a plummeting valuation. Databricks' biggest rival Snowflake lost nearly 45% of its value over the same period.Story continuesPartnership With NvidiaDatabricks has a long-standing history with Nvidia, as the former uses Nvidia graphic processing units in its software. Nvidia's investment in Databricks came as no surprise.""It made sense to partner more closely,"" Ghodsi said. ""At the core, we're in complementary markets.""""Databricks and Nvidia are building transformative AI technology, and we're excited about the business value and innovation we can bring to our customers,"" Ghodsi said.Databricks' acquisition of MosaicML in June has propelled demand for Nvidia's chips, as enterprise data often forms a stepping stone for generative AI.""Databricks is doing incredible work with Nvidia technology to accelerate data processing and generative AI models,"" Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang said.Trending: Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This Startup Is Automating The Trillion-Dollar Hospitality Market. AI Startup Looks To Put Airbnb Hosting And Property Management On AutopilotShocking Investment From Capital OneU.S.-based banking holding company Capital One also partook in Databricks' latest funding round last month, despite being the largest customer of Snowflake, one of its biggest competitors.In August 2022, Snowflake CFO Mike Scarpelli disclosed during an investor event that Capital One was annually allocating nearly $50 million to Snowflake. In November, he reiterated that Capital One is Snowflake's leading customer. Nonetheless, Capital One also employs Databricks technology to detect fraudulent activities or patterns.Robust Growth TrajectoryDatabricks boasts a customer base of more than 10,000 globally, including more than 300 customers generating annual revenue run rates of $1 million or more as of July 31. The firm also unveiled 20 new products and features during its sold-out Data and AI Summit in June.One of Databricks' priorities has been to cut down its costs while maintaining its growth rate. The company's primary cost-cutting avenues have been in technology usage and software subscriptions. This is in sharp contrast to the market view last year, where tech firms were laying off the majority of their workforce to curb their spending levels.""We spent $30 million on 300 pieces of SaaS (software as a service) software,"" Ghodsi said. ""I said, ‘Let's halve that.'""Databricks has experienced significant growth and achievements in the second fiscal quarter of 2023, which ended July 31, with over $1.5 billion in revenue run rate, marking over 50% year-over-year revenue growth. This period also saw the company achieve its highest-ever quarterly incremental revenue growth.

Prior to VX-880 treatment, all six patients enrolled had long-standing T1D with no endogenous insulin secretion, required an average of 34.0 units of insulin per day, and had a history of recurrent severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) in the year prior to screening.All patients in Part A and B now have more than 90 days of follow-up and have demonstrated islet cell engraftment and endogenous glucose-responsive insulin production on the Day 90 mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT). All patients demonstrated improved glycemic control across all measures, including decreases in HbA1c, improved time-in-range on continuous insulin monitoring, and reduction or elimination of exogenous insulin use.The two patients with at least 12 months of follow-up after VX-880 infusion, who were therefore evaluable for the study’s primary efficacy endpoint, met the criteria for the primary endpoint of elimination of SHEs between Day 90 and Month 12 with an HbA1c &lt;7.0%. The first patient achieved insulin independence at Day 270 through Month 24. This is a patient who has had T1D for nearly 42 years and prior to trial enrollment was on 34 units of daily exogenous insulin. The second patient achieved insulin independence at Day 180 through Month 12. This is a patient who has had T1D for 19 years and prior to trial enrollment was on 45.1 units of daily exogenous insulin. Starting at Month 15, this patient was started on four units of basal insulin daily, at the investigator’s discretion. After the data cut-off date, a third patient achieved insulin independence at Day 180.Story continuesVX-880 has been generally well tolerated in all patients dosed to date. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, and there were no serious AEs related to VX-880 treatment. As previously reported, one subject had SHEs in the perioperative period. There have been no other SHEs in the study.""We continue to marvel at the impressive data from the VX-880 program as evidenced by the improvements in all treated patients across all glycemic measures,"" said Trevor Reichman, M.D., Department of Surgery, University of Toronto. ""This represents an incredibly promising investigational therapy, one with far-reaching potential.""""These data are particularly meaningful in the context of our overall investigational T1D program, as these same VX-880 cells are the foundation for our VX-264 cells-plus-device program, and our hypoimmune islet cell program,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. ""We are moving with urgency to bring these potentially transformative therapies to patients who are waiting.""These data were presented during the European Association for the Study of Diabetes 59th Annual Meeting on October 3, 2023, in Hamburg, Germany as an oral presentation, ""Glucose-Dependent Insulin Production and Insulin-Independence in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Infused with Stem Cell-Derived, Fully Differentiated Islet Cells (VX-880)"" (abstract/publication #449).About Vertex T1D Programs in Clinical DevelopmentAbout VX-880VX-880 is an investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell therapy manufactured using proprietary technology. VX-880 is being evaluated for patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. VX-880 has the potential to restore the body’s ability to regulate glucose levels by restoring pancreatic islet cell function, including glucose responsive insulin production. VX-880 is delivered by an infusion into the hepatic portal vein and requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. The VX-880 trial has expanded to additional sites that are currently active and enrolling in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands, and France.VX-880 was recently granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency in March 2023, in addition to Fast Track Designation by the U.S. FDA in March 2021. PRIME designation is granted to innovative new therapies that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need.About the VX-880 Phase 1/2 Clinical TrialThe clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. This study is designed as a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-880. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the clinical trial. Enrollment in Part C of the study is ongoing and multiple patients have been dosed.About VX-264VX-264 is an investigational cell therapy in which allogeneic human stem cell-derived islets are encapsulated in a channel array device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system. VX-264 is designed to be surgically implanted and is currently being evaluated for patients with T1D.About the VX-264 Phase 1/2 Clinical TrialThe clinical trial is a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label study in patients who have T1D. This will be a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of VX-264. Approximately 17 patients will be enrolled in the global clinical trial. Enrollment is ongoing in this study.About Type 1 DiabetesT1D results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas, leading to loss of insulin production and impairment of blood glucose control. The absence of insulin leads to abnormalities in how the body processes nutrients, leading to high blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and, over time, to complications such as kidney disease/failure, eye disease (including vision loss), heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, and even death.Due to the limitations and complexities of insulin delivery systems, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain balance in glucose control in people with T1D. Current standards of care do not address the underlying causes of the disease, and there are limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D; there is currently no cure for diabetes.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has multiple approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) — a rare, life-threatening genetic disease — and has several ongoing clinical and research programs in CF. Beyond CF, Vertex has a robust clinical pipeline of investigational small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies (including gene editing) in other serious diseases where it has deep insight into causal human biology, including sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, acute and neuropathic pain, type 1 diabetes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Founded in 1989 in Cambridge, Mass., Vertex's global headquarters is now located in Boston's Innovation District and its international headquarters is in London. Additionally, the company has research and development sites and commercial offices in North America, Europe, Australia, and Latin America.

However, lingering supply-chain challenges might continue to delay deliveries and thereby remain a threat to the industry players.Nevertheless, improved projections for air travel, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for companies that are engaged in commercial aerospace operations. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Textron.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 26.2% year over year in July 2023, thereby reaching 95.6% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019.Story continuesLooking ahead, IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, as stated in its latest global outlook for air transport. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in June 2023, the U.S. defense bill for fiscal 2024, reflecting a 3.6% increase over the fiscal 2023 enacted level, got its approval. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business.Although the global economy has started to improve, aircraft manufacturers project supply-chain issues to continue to delay aircraft production and deliveries, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in commercial aerospace.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Textron (NYSE:TXT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Textron How Quickly Is Textron Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, Textron has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 39%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Textron achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 5.6% to US$13b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Textron.Are Textron Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Textron, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$69m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Story continuesDoes Textron Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Textron's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, Textron is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Textron by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.Although Textron certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services, and supply-chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 26.2% year over year in July 2023, thereby reaching 95.6% of the traffic numbers seen in 2019. Looking ahead, IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, as stated in its latest global outlook for air transport. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in June 2023, the U.S. defense bill for fiscal 2024, reflecting a 3.6% increase over the fiscal 2023 enacted level, got its approval. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace, and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, aircraft manufacturers project supply-chain issues to continue to delay aircraft production and deliveries, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in the commercial aerospace.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector.

376,06b70d36-bf77-3dd7-ba5f-4fb55601ad18,KO,2023-10-04,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 62% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-120025179.html,1696420825,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Coca-Cola implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Coca-Cola, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.0% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Coca-Cola Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.6b worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Coca-Cola. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 9.2% of the Coca-Cola shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Coca-Cola  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

377,b70930b7-3968-34ca-bfd9-c0d6cc30c174,KO,2023-10-04,Why Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coca-cola-europacific-partners-093948126.html,1696412388,STORY,['KO'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is:22% = €1.7b ÷ €7.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn €0.22 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a better ROE than the average (10%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCoca-Cola Europacific Partners' Debt And Its 22% ROECoca-Cola Europacific Partners clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.46. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Coca-Cola Europacific Partners may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(Nasdaq: WIX), a leading global SaaS platform to create, manage and grow an online presence, as well as an integration with Buy with Prime, enhanced generative AI (genAI) and SMS features, bringing marketers more tools and data than ever to better target, personalize, and automate their marketing during the holiday shopping season. Intuit is the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231003376910/en/Four in five customers prefer email over any other form of communication, according to a new holiday report from Mailchimp, ""This Holiday, It’s Personal."" (Graphic: Business Wire)All of these new features and enhancements will debut today at Mailchimp’s annual Marketing Success Season, a three-day virtual conference designed to equip marketers with the tools, education, and inspiration they need to create and implement successful marketing strategies this holiday season. Notable speakers include e-commerce author and podcast host Ian Hammersly and Rohit Bhargava, author, multiple-startup founder and marketing expert, among others.This Year, It’s PersonalOver the next three days, Ian, Rohit, and various Mailchimp leaders and experts will be sharing the importance of personalization, so growing businesses can use marketing that fits their customer wants and needs, regardless of the size of their audience–or ""personalization at scale."" This customization makes consumers feel valued and helps brands build trust with their customers, which is especially important around the holidays. In fact, over 70% of customers feel more valued when they receive personalized emails, and they have more trust in companies that send them personalized emails, according to a new holiday report from Mailchimp, ""This Holiday, It’s Personal.""Story continuesFor many marketers, the holiday season is critical to their bottom line. According to the survey of e-commerce professionals and consumers conducted by Edelman DxI on behalf of Mailchimp in June of 2023, two-thirds of marketers estimate that the holiday season drives between 21%-40% of their company’s annual revenue. During the 2022 Black Friday weekend, Mailchimp customers sent more than 8 billion emails.With so many businesses vying for the attention of customers, it can be difficult to break through the noise—especially in inboxes that are already crowded. A common response from time-strapped marketers is to send as many emails as possible to as many people as possible, but marketers actually see better business results when they take a more focused, personalized approach. In fact, customers are 87% more likely to click into an email if it’s personalized to them, and 71% of customers are more likely to purchase from a company that sends them personalized email. †We know, however, that marketers have a lot on their plates, and learning (and adopting) new techniques or strategies isn’t always easy. Nearly 3 in 4 marketers feel overwhelmed by all the different [personalization] capabilities offered and the same percentage don’t have the time to explore all of those capabilities. †""No matter the size of your business, whether you’re speaking to an audience of 15 or 150,000, delivering personalization at scale is challenging. In one single platform, our users can manage customer engagement from attraction to purchase so they reach their customers at the right place and time this holiday season,"" said Kenneth Chestnut, Global Head of Ecosystem at Intuit Mailchimp. ""We’re thrilled to announce a multi-year, strategic partnership with Wix to deliver a single source of truth for marketers and small businesses. Marketers can tap into a wealth of marketing best practices when connecting their Wix accounts to Mailchimp, getting recommendations and generated content that are built with insights derived from an international data footprint at their core.""Partnering with Wix to Help Businesses GrowComing soon, Mailchimp users with a Wix account will be able to seamlessly sync and organize their customer data with a Mailchimp and Wix collaboration. This will help marketers using Wix customize their campaigns based on Mailchimp's real-time behavioral data with segmentation and customer journey tools to drive better engagement and use AI-powered features that automate and offer performance suggestions for strategy optimization.Marketers can set themselves up for success when they can integrate their customer data. Through the upcoming integration between Wix and Mailchimp users will benefit from stronger functionality and ease of use between marketing and business management.Intuit’s substantial solutions combined with Wix's comprehensive online platform will provide mutual users with the necessary tools needed to manage and grow businesses through this strategic partnership. For self-creators using Wix, the integration will provide greater functionality and ease of use. Agencies and freelancers using Wix Studio will benefit from offering their clients a complete email marketing suite with industry-leading marketing tools.""We see great strategic value in this partnership with Intuit and the positive impact it will have on our complementary users,"" said Anthony Scaglione, EVP of Global Partners at Wix. ""This partnership is a true collaboration of best-of-class solutions to support the ever-changing needs of businesses and will give users more tools to grow their businesses and thrive in today’s digital landscape.""The cross-platform integration will have a gradual global rollout in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom soon.Boosting Conversions with Buy with PrimeThe Mailchimp for Buy with Prime app, built by Alloy Automation, is an integration that helps boost conversions and enhance merchant-customer relationships. It transfers Buy with Prime events — such as an abandoned checkout — and the shopper’s contact details to Mailchimp, enabling automated personalized checkout recovery campaigns built by Mailchimp’s Customer Journey Builder, whose automations generate up to 7x more order for users with connected stores than bulk emails.2 In fact, Mailchimp customers see an average lift of 21% in their click-rates in one week after connecting their store with Mailchimp's e-commerce integrations.3Shown to help increase shopper conversion, Buy with Prime helps independent e-commerce sites grow their businesses using the trusted, convenient experience and benefits of Prime, including fast, free shipping, seamless checkout, and easy returns. Together, these powerful tools equip marketers with unsurpassed access to actionable insight for advanced opportunities to re-engage and cultivate relationships with customers with automated reminders or incentives that lead to complete purchase cycles.Enabling Personalization at Scale with Generative AI, SMS, and MoreMailchimp’s Holiday Report found that more than 1 in 4 customers say they want more content that feels personalized to them.† As we approach a holiday season in the midst of economic change and evolving consumer preferences, the purchasing power that personalization can unlock for marketers is invaluable. In addition to the new integrations, Mailchimp is enabling customer personalization with new genAI and SMS features*, including advanced segmentation, automations, and email build and text generation.Just when marketers need the extra support, Mailchimp customers in Standard and Premium plans can leverage their customer data and the power of Intuit Assist to unlock a new level of personalization in their marketing. Intuit Assist for Mailchimp is a genAI-powered marketing assistant that helps marketers generate content, deeply personalize their marketing, and optimize their marketing strategy by unlocking insights from all of their customer data. Intuit Assist is currently available in beta to select customers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia, with broader global availability coming soon.Furthermore, US-based Mailchimp customers on paid plans can now automate their SMS outreach in Campaign Manager and Customer Journey Builder and manage 1:1 conversations with SMS in their Mailchimp Inbox, bringing all their customer communications in one place. By adding SMS to their marketing strategy, marketers can reach even more customers at scale — attaining peak levels of engagement while also building and maintaining 1:1 connections.Intuit Mailchimp is the AI omnichannel platform marketers need to succeed through the holiday shopping season—and now with the Mailchimp app available in Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese, more marketers than ever can take advantage of Mailchimp to optimize their performance*.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears. Some companies pay dividends, but they haven't consistently kept up with them, and some have even reduced or stopped paying them altogether.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns. We’re attracted to RSG’s leading position in a stable business with a high degree of recurring revenue, and we believe the company is at an inflection point with its pricing strategy and landfill asset utilization.

The company is known for its strong value proposition driven by high-quality low-cost offerings including a well-regarded private-label brand. Costco regularly ranks at the top of customer surveys related to brand trust, product price and quality, and all-around experience.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for LyondellBasell Industries, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$37b - US$7.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for LyondellBasell Industries compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LyondellBasell Industries.What Does the ROCE Trend For LyondellBasell Industries Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at LyondellBasell Industries doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 11% from 27% five years ago. Given the business is employing more capital while revenue has slipped, this is a bit concerning. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayFrom the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for LyondellBasell Industries have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 26% in the last five years. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

SUM.Industry: Concrete &amp; AggregatesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2159147/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-promising-concrete-aggregates-industryA boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act collectively signify a substantial commitment to bolstering American competitiveness. These three recently enacted laws are aimed at revitalizing American infrastructure, expediting the shift toward a sustainable economy, and fortifying the domestic semiconductor sector.Story continuesThese bills comprise new investments in almost every infrastructure sector, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector.

This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This oil refiner has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.26%.For the most recent quarter, Valero Energy was expected to post earnings of $5.08 per share, but it reported $5.40 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.30%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.24 per share, while it actually produced $8.27 per share, a surprise of 14.23%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Valero Energy. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.94%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

VLO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VLOValero Energy Corp (NYSE:VLO) is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. It operates 15 refineries with a total throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels a day in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Valero also owns 12 ethanol plants with capacity of 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol a year and holds a 50% stake in Diamond Green Diesel, which has capacity to produce 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel. With a current stock price of $133.06 and a GF Value of $132.95, Valero Energy appears to be fairly valued. The following sections delve deeper into the company's value.Valero Energy (VLO): A Deep Dive into Its Fair Market ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is an estimation of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair trading value of a stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it's overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO)'s stock appears to be fairly valued according to the GF Value calculation. At its current price of $133.06 per share, Valero Energy has a market cap of $47 billion. As the stock is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesValero Energy (VLO): A Deep Dive into Its Fair Market ValuationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Valero Energy has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.45, which ranks worse than 51.66% of 1026 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Valero Energy's financial strength as 8 out of 10, suggesting a strong balance sheet.Valero Energy (VLO): A Deep Dive into Its Fair Market ValuationProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Valero Energy has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $157.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $29.03. Its operating margin is 9.48%, which ranks better than 51.89% of 979 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Valero Energy is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Valero Energy is 19.4%, which ranks better than 69.3% of 860 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 45.7%, which ranks better than 80.99% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Valero Energy's ROIC is 28.86 while its WACC came in at 10.27.Valero Energy (VLO): A Deep Dive into Its Fair Market ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) appears to be fairly valued.

With this, 2023 marked the fourth year in a row that the S&amp;P 500 logged losses in September, per data from Deutsche Bank.Fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period took the sheen away from stocks in the month. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, shed 3.1% last month. Despite the losses, some stocks in the ETF stood tall.We have highlighted five stocks that are in green and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). These include Centene Corporation CNC, WestRock WRK, CF Industries Holdings Inc CF, Valero Energy VLO and Charter Communications CHTR.The Fed, in its latest meeting, kept interest rates steady at a 22-year high, in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, but signaled one more hike this year. Though inflation is easing, it remains elevated and above the Fed’s 2% target (read: Bet on Quality ETFs as Fed Keeps Rate Steady, View Hawkish).Meanwhile, the latest bouts of weak economic data have sparked fears of a slowdown. U.S. consumer sentiment slipped for the second straight month in September as the University of Michigan's preliminary reading of its Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to 67.7 from the final reading of 69.5 in August. Meanwhile, new home sales declined 8.7% in August from July and home prices continued to ascend, with the Case-Shiller Index growing 1% year over year in July.  Further, the combination of a steadily appreciating U.S. dollar, escalating yields, and surging oil prices presents a trio of challenges that could potentially impede the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy, posing concerns for investors. In fact, surging oil prices threaten to revive inflationary pressure. Moreover, Wall Street is grappling with global economic uncertainties, U.S. auto workers' strike that may intensify inflation, and the reinstatement of U.S. student loan repayments that could impact household spending.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $402 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 67 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors.

392,a7d93478-2042-34a1-bd16-771724b31375,VLO,2023-10-04,5 Energy Stocks That Crushed the S&P 500 in a Bleak Q3,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-energy-stocks-crushed-p-134300363.html,1696340580,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'VLO', 'PSX', 'HAL', 'MPC']","[The third quarter of 2023 was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 4% in what was brought about by a severe setback consecutively in August and September.Market participants expressed significant worry as the Fed warned of an additional 25 basis point rate hike before the year-end, indicating a prolonged period of higher interest rates to fight the stubborn inflation. Consequently, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to drag on.But through the stock market’s first quarterly loss of 2023, the Oil/Energy sector stood out, with oil prices within spitting distance of the $100-a-barrel threshold and some of the companies being the biggest winners of the July-September period. The standout performers of the third quarter were Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Halliburton HAL, Valero Energy VLO and APA Corporation APA.Energy Stands Tall Amid Broad-Based DeclineAlthough the S&amp;P 500 finished the quarter in the red, a particular group of stocks stood out.On the sectoral front, it was energy that topped the S&amp;P standings for the period with an outsized gain, while most others lost value. The space has comprehensively outperformed the market, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR’s (an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies, popularly known by its ticker, XLE) impressive gains, primarily fueled by a tight supply picture and the geopolitical premium. To be precise, the energy index generated a total return of 11.3% in the third quarter against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 3.7%.Much of this can be attributed to Saudi Arabia's June declaration of a unilateral reduction in oil output by 1 million barrels per day. This production cut, initially extended through August and September and subsequently continued for the rest of 2023, has served as the primary driver of the increase in oil prices.In addition to Riyadh's efforts, recent data from the Energy Information Administration revealed a significant decrease in U.S. commercial crude inventories. Since July, these inventories have fallen by almost 42 million barrels. To put that in context, total domestic stock now stands at 416.3 million barrels — 3.3% less than the year-ago figure and 4% less than the five-year average.Furthermore, supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) have now dropped to 22 million barrels — the lowest since July 2022.In response, WTI oil prices topped $95 last week for its highest intraday level since August of last year. While there are jitters over high inflation and stuttering economic growth, these have more than offset the tightening supply outlook.Most energy investors have had something to cheer about in the September quarter, but some stocks certainly performed better than others. The five largest contributors to the quarterly sectoral gains were Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Halliburton, Valero Energy and APA Corporation.Will these winners maintain their run in the last quarter of 2023, too, or will they eventually run out of steam? Here's a summary of them:Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to a lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC handily outperformed all but one stock and was up 29.8% during the period, ranking second on the S&amp;P 500 list. While Marathon continues to generate strong cash flows amid a disciplined capital strategy and increasing shareholder returns, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) downstream operator’s further price gains could be limited by operational issues and an unpredictable refining macro backdrop.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Phillips 66: Another major refiner in terms of size, efficiency and strength, Phillips 66 buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Phillips 66, carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, rallied 26% last quarter. With its vast pipeline network, the company is also a big player in the midstream business, generating stable fee-based revenues. Higher commodity prices have driven upstream investments, thereby increasing volumes for midstream operators. However, due to lower demand for refined petroleum products, the firm might miss the potential gain in refining margins. Thus, Phillips 66 is likely to witness a decrease in its total capacity utilizations. Hence, we expect pre-tax income from refining business to be lower this year.Halliburton: It is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial and government sectors. Halliburton operates in over 80 countries. Founded in 1919, Halliburton employs more than 40,000 people and operates under two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.This stock was the third-best sector performer on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares appreciating 22.8% in the past quarter. But it will be a bumpy ride in the near-to-medium term. While the company’s significant global presence exposes it to worldwide geopolitical risks, the rapidly rising labor and material costs are cutting margins. Finally, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) energy company’s above-average debt-to-capitalization and low dividend yield are other negatives in the HAL story.Valero Energy: Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of VLO’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to export facilities.This Zacks Rank #3 stock ended 20.8% higher in the last three-month period. The Gulf Coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero is expected to capitalize on the rising demand for distillate fuel. However, there are concerns about Valero’s high debt levels, which leave it vulnerable to any volatility in commodity prices. Also, higher oil and gas prices can lead to increased input costs for Valero, thereby putting pressure on the profit margins. This suggests a tricky risk/reward profile and limited upside potential VLO.APA Corporation: It is one of the world's leading independent energy firms engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Geographically, the company’s operations are in the United States, Egypt and the North Sea of the United Kingdom. APA also holds acreage in offshore Suriname (South America) and other international locations.This stock, with a Zacks Rank of 3, ended 20.3% higher in the July-September period. APA’s slew of discoveries in offshore Suriname, through its joint venture with TotalEnergies, is a major positive catalyst for the company. Over time, Suriname is expected to become one of APA’s major assets with significant cash flow potential. However, the company's high leverage restricts its financial flexibility. Moreover, APA’s significant exposure to forex currency and the associated risks might put off some investors.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

397,bea55e1f-551d-3bc8-bebe-16e16152e90c,EL,2023-10-04,The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) Has A ROE Of 16%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-inc-120036695.html,1696420836,STORY,['EL'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:16% = US$1.0b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.16 in profit.Does Estée Lauder Companies Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Estée Lauder Companies has a similar ROE to the average in the Personal Products industry classification (13%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Story continuesWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining Estée Lauder Companies' Debt And Its 16% Return On EquityEstée Lauder Companies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.28. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 10th of October, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders may still be hesitant of being overly generous with CEO compensation. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble Comparing The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's CEO Compensation With The IndustryOur data indicates that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company has a market capitalization of US$342b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$22m for the year to June 2023. We note that's an increase of 23% above last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.6m.For comparison, other companies in the American Household Products industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$8.4m. Hence, we can conclude that Jon Moeller is remunerated higher than the industry median. What's more, Jon Moeller holds US$45m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.Component20232022Proportion (2023)SalaryUS$1.6mUS$1.5m7%OtherUS$20mUS$16m93%Total CompensationUS$22mUS$18m100%Speaking on an industry level, nearly 15% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 85% is other remuneration. In Procter &amp; Gamble's case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationA Look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's Growth NumbersOver the past three years, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 5.9% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 2.3%.We'd prefer higher revenue growth, but it is good to see modest EPS growth. It's clear the performance has been quite decent, but it it falls short of outstanding,based on this information. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..Has The Procter &amp; Gamble Company Been A Good Investment?The Procter &amp; Gamble Company has generated a total shareholder return of 12% over three years, so most shareholders would be reasonably content. But they probably don't want to see the CEO paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.To Conclude...Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. However, if the board proposes to increase the compensation, some shareholders might have questions given that the CEO is already being paid higher than the industry.While CEO pay is an important factor to be aware of, there are other areas that investors should be mindful of as well. We did our research and spotted 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble that investors should look into moving forward.Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

Kicking off in October in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this effort aims to foster improved health and wellness practices within the U.S. Hispanic community by promoting the importance of proactive health care habits.Aflac's ""Remission with a Mission"" campaign confronts a stark reality - 1 in 4 adults have chosen to forgo essential health screenings due to a perception of good health, according to Aflac's Wellness Matters survey, conducted specifically among Hispanics. The survey also unveiled that 72% of Hispanic respondents diagnosed with cancer became aware of their condition during routine medical exams or regularly scheduled annual screenings, compared to 46% among the general population. Additionally, an alarming 31% of Hispanics reported they encounter language barriers that hinder their access to preventive care resources. These findings highlight the urgent need to bridge language gaps and amplify health education initiatives within the U.S. Hispanic community.""Joining forces with Aflac for the 'Remission with a Mission' campaign holds a personal significance for me. I discovered the importance of wellness checkups firsthand when I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the young age of 33. My journey has shown me the critical role that early detection and proactive health care play in saving lives,"" said Lopez. ""The troubling statistics regarding health habits within the Hispanic community deeply moved me - I want to urge my community to prioritize regular screenings to identify potential health concerns early and take charge of our well-being.""Story continues""The 'Remission with a Mission' campaign will blend Adamari's popularity with her authentic and inspiring journey to encourage proactive health care practices within the Hispanic community,"" said Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, senior vice president and chief communications officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""We need to bridge gaps, break down language barriers and empower individuals to take charge of their health. Together we will emphasize the value of early detection and promote regular health screenings. Like Adamari, Aflac is on a mission to help patients and families create better health habits.""Aflac's Wellness Matters Survey examined attitudes, habits and opinions about health and preventive care, uncovering that many adults are skipping wellness appointments and screenings that can help save their lives, including mammograms, blood tests, pap smears, STDs, skin cancer, and colonoscopies. These findings underscore the need for increased engagement and education within the U.S. Hispanic community, transcending language barriers and advocating for proactive health care practices.Additional insights from Aflac's Wellness Matters Survey:Loved ones carry high impact on promoting health: Many U.S. Hispanics (67%) say they benefit from friends and family who encourage them to go to the doctor for routine visits. Individuals are more likely to schedule checkups and prioritize wellness screenings as adults if their parents or caregivers demonstrated good habits, such as scheduling childhood wellness appointments, early in life.Gender dynamics: Hispanic men exhibit a more positive outlook on their current and future health compared to women.Generational divide: Younger generations, including Gen Z, feel less control over their health but are more likely to skip annual wellness visits.Aflac's collaboration with Adamari Lopez exemplifies its commitment to fostering a healthier future for the U.S. Hispanic community. Together, Aflac and Adamari are working to break down barriers, inspire positive change and prioritize wellness for all.

As part of the Hispanic population report, 200 Spanish-speaking respondents were added for a total of 580 respondents to ensure a robust understanding of this population.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that VEOEY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than AWK has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.75, while AWK has a forward P/E of 24.93. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 0.83. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.26. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

WTRG announced that it has completed the sale of its natural gas utility assets in West Virginia to Hope Gas, a company located in Morgantown, WV.The customer base of Peoples West Virginia, with a total of around 13,000, was the lowest among all the states where Essential Utilities works. WTRG’s decision of selling its natural gas operations to Hope Gas makes sense as the latter has larger operations in the state. This now allows WTRG to concentrate on the states where it performs the majority of its natural gas business.The transaction will allow Essential Utilities to prioritize the growth of Aqua, its water and wastewater business. With Aqua’s increasing presence Western Pennsylvania and long-standing involvement in the neighborhood, the Peoples Gas operation in the area continues to be a significant part of WTRG’s acquisition plan.The remaining gas operations will focus on conducting effective, safe operation, and lowering emissions through pipeline replacement and creating a local energy center that supports high-potential alternative fuels. WTRG is committed to lowering emissions from natural gas, water and wastewater operations. It also aims to reduce annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 60% within 2035 from the 2019 level.Water Industry’s Focus on InvestmentPer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet customers’ demand over the next 20 years.Post the sale of West Virginia gas utility assets, Essential Utilities will focus on its long-term strategy of infrastructure investment and growth with the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. The company has already invested $1.06 billion in 2022 and plans to invest $3.3 billion during 2023-2025 to fortify operations and efficiently serve the expanding customer base.Along with Essential Utilities, other water supply companies like American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, American States Water AWR and California Water Service Group CWT also aim to improve their infrastructure through investments.American Water Works aims to invest $2.9 billion in 2023 to strengthen and expand its water and wastewater infrastructure.

(FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-freeport-mcmoran-130006925.html,1696338006,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this mining company have returned -11.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.9% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has lost 11% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +42.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.17 indicates a change of +34.7% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.08 billion and $24.33 billion estimates indicate +1.3% and +5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +25%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

414,7193090d-2a62-35a4-a7fc-d746d4fac540,PEP,2023-10-04,PepsiCo (PEP) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-pep-reports-next-week-140002763.html,1696341602,STORY,['PEP'],"[The market expects PepsiCo (PEP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 10, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.2%.Revenues are expected to be $23.42 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo?For PepsiCo, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.09%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of $1.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.09, delivering a surprise of +7.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PepsiCo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has filed a lawsuit against Union Pacific over allegedly firing 21 train conductors and locomotive engineers who failed a company-administered vision test.The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota last Friday, alleges that UP (NYSE: UNP) violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because the railroad terminated employment on the basis of disability and used an unlawful qualification in screening those 21 individuals.The EEOC said in a Monday news release that the light cannon test created by UP doesn’t replicate real-world conditions or accurately assess whether someone can identify the color of railroad signals. Upon failing the test, UP placed the individuals on indefinite leave and also required some of the individuals to undergo “inappropriate” medical exams and questing, according to the EEOC.“It is illegal under the ADA to terminate an employee on the basis of a perceived disability,” said Diane Smason, acting director of the EEOC’s Chicago District. “Discrimination against disabled workers is a problem the EEOC will continue to vigorously address.”Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Chicago District, said, “Everyone wants railroads to be safe. However, firing qualified, experienced employees for failing an invalid test of color vision does nothing to promote safety, and violates the ADA.”EEOC reportedly filed the lawsuit after a failed attempt to go through the conciliation process with UP. The agency wants the individuals to be reinstated and receive back pay. EEOC also wants UP to pay for compensatory and punitive damages as well as change its policies.In response to the lawsuit, UP told FreightWaves that the vision tests it administers have been reviewed and approved by the Federal Railroad Administration.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) which saw its share price drive 113% higher over five years. In the last week shares have slid back 3.3%.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Ameriprise Financial achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 16% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Ameriprise Financial the TSR over the last 5 years was 137%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Ameriprise Financial has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 16% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 19% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

419,5bd2702e-c5db-379f-a0ff-23b8eda04ee7,GPS,2023-10-04,Ticking Time Bombs: 7 Consumer Stocks to Dump Before the Damage Is Done,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ticking-time-bombs-7-consumer-105032595.html,1695898232,STORY,"['GME', 'GPS', 'SAM', 'PLNT', 'BROS']","[With the potential for consumer spending to decrease in the months ahead, uncertainty is rising with consumer stocks. Sure, U.S. consumers have been resilient despite challenges such as high inflation and rising interest rates.However, this resilience may morph into weakness. Just this week, the Conference Board announced that the Consumer Confidence Index just hit a four-month low.According to the Conference Board’s chief economist, Dana Peterson, a pull back in consumer spending may be in store, as interest rates stay high, student loan repayments resume, and pandemic-era savings are depleted.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDon’t get me wrong, not all consumer stocks are on the verge of collapsing.Some consumer staples names could actually perform well, as another round of economic/stock market turbulence causes investors to cycle back into defensive stocks like consumer-focused blue-chips.But with consumer cyclical stocks, especially more speculative consumer cyclical names, all bets are off. With this in mind, you may want to make an exit/steer clear of these seven consumer stocks to sell.Dutch Bros (BROS)Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona.Source: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.comThe potential for a consumer spending slowdown/decline has already weighed on Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) shares, which have dropped by around 22.7% in the past month.The Grants Pass, Oregon-based drive-thru coffee chain has experienced a high level of growth in the years following the pandemic.Between 2020 and 2022, revenue more than doubled, and the company has finally reached the point of GAAP profitability.However, even as earnings forecasts call for earnings to keep steadily increasing, with Dutch Bros releasing an underwhelming update to guidance after its earnings release in August, coupled with the current consumer slowdown, more disappointment may be ahead.“Priced for perfection” at 138.5 times forward earnings, further bad news could drive another big drop for BROS stock. The company also earlier this month raised $300 million through a secondary offering. The resultant dilution could also have a negative impact on future returns.Story continuesGameStop (GME)An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.Source: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.comGameStop (NYSE:GME) may be known for being one of the top meme stocks, but the video game retailer is first and foremost a consumer discretionary stock.Shares may have already coughed back a large amount of their meme-era gains, yet it may just well be the consumer slowdown that knocks this “meme king” back to pre-2021 prices.With the company reporting satisfactory results last quarter, including lower-than-expected losses, it makes sense why GME stock is holding steady right now.However, if consumer resilience during the summer morphs into greater belt-tightening in the fall and winter, GameStop could report far more lackluster results over the next few quarters.Even worse, as InvestorPlace’s Thomas Yeung pointed out just after the Sep. 6 earning release, it appears that the company is in managed decline mode. This in turn points to my bearish “GameStop is the next Blockbuster thesis” playing out with GME.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockGap (NYSE:GPS) shares may be reasonably-priced, at around 14.7 times forward earnings.The entrance of a new CEO Richard Dickson and the subsequent planned ramping up turnaround efforts, may suggest that this retailer stock has nowhere to go but higher from here.Unfortunately, while GPS stock on the surface may sound like a potential contrarian buy, a closer look suggests it is instead one of the consumer stocks to sell.While Gap may seem cheap compared to stocks overall, comparable names trade at even lower valuations. The turnaround talk notwithstanding, before results could potentially improve, more pain may lie ahead.At least, that’s the view of InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer. After reporting declining sales during last quarter (6% year-over-year), declines during this quarter are expected to be even greater (10%).A further shattering of consumer confidence may lead to even more poor fiscal performance during the holiday quarter.Planet Fitness (PLNT)A Planet Fitness (PLNT) exterior in Roseville, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAs I recently discussed, an unexpected CEO ouster has driven a big price decline for Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT).Following this steep drop, shares in the fitness center franchising company may seem oversold to some today.My view? Err on the side of caution, and hold off on PLNT stock. Why? For one, shares have tanked, but almost entirely because of the uncertainty surrounding future leadership, as the company has appointed an interim CEO, yet is still searching for a permanent replacement.They may not fully factor the potential impact of a consumer pullback into PLNT’s valuation.Sure, as one Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, the low Planet Fitness membership price could serve as an economic moat.However, while this may keep the performance of existing operations steady, a low gym price isn’t going to solve the issues affecting franchisee growth, such as rising construction costs and high interest rates.Boston Beer Company (SAM)Boston Beer Co SAM stockSource: LunaseeStudios / Shutterstock.comBoston Beer Company (NYSE:SAM) is the beverage firm behind alcoholic brands like Samuel Adams, Angry Orchard, and Truly Hard Seltzer.One of the hottest consumer stocks during the pandemic, SAM has dropped in price considerably since then.Chalk this up to management’s overestimation of hard seltzer’s enduring popularity. More recently, however, investors have been warming back up to SAM stock.The success of a newer product, Twisted Tea, is helping to counter declining hard seltzer sales. However, analysts and investors may be overestimating how much Twisted Tea will lead Boston Beer back to levels last seen during the height of Truly’s popularity.Shares today trade for 50.1 times earnings, a steep premium to most other alcoholic beverage stocks.SAM shares may be cheaper today than they were nearly three years ago, but just like in late 2020/early 2021, this stock could be “priced for perfection” once again.Wayfair (W)Wayfair (W) sign on Wayfair office in Las Vegas, Nevada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWith around 27.6% of its outstanding float sold short, Wayfair (NYSE:W) is one of the most heavily shorted consumer stocks.With this high level of short interest, you may be curious as to whether there’s any strong “short squeeze potential” with shares in this online home furnishings retailer.Yet while anything’s possible, the short side of the trade with W stock has become very crowded for a good reason. After peaking during the 2020 lockdown era, sales for the company have continued to drop.The consumer slowdown, plus the slowdown in the housing market, are likely contributing to this post-pandemic hangover.Declining revenues have also swung Wayfair from marginally profitable, to extremely unprofitable.Over the trailing twelve months, the retailer has reported net losses of just over $1 billion. Although forecasts call for losses to narrow considerably next year, today’s consumer spending trends call this into question.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.Source: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.comWynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) may have avoided being a victim of the cyberattacks that recently hit leading casino operators such as Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), but that doesn’t make this gaming stock a buy.It’s likely best to consider WYNN stock a sell instead. Mainly, due to the stock’s “priced for perfection” vibes.Sure, a forward multiple of 28 might not seem extremely pricey, although this represents a premium to many other casino stocks. However, expectations could be too high right now. How so? Yes, gaming revenue in Wynn’s flagship market Macau has bounced back considerably.This comes despite post-Covid economic challenges in mainland China. Still, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff argued back in August, the upside from this may already be priced-in.A worsening macro picture in China could eventually affect the operating performance of the company’s three Macau casino properties.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Top 10 Dividend Stocks of 2023. The S&amp;P 500 didn't perform well in September and ended the third quarter on a low note mainly because investors were worried about the U.S. economy and the possibility of a government shutdown. Even with some positive economic news, the S&amp;P 500's value dropped by 4.5% last month. However, it's still up by 10.35% for the year so far, despite concerns about a possible U.S. recession. This is because inflation has eased, and rising interest rates didn't harm the economy as much as experts thought. Investors are hopeful that things will get better this month because historically, October has been a good month for the broader market. They are looking forward to a potential turnaround in the market during this time.This year, investors are shifting their focus toward assets that generate income. While tech stocks performed strongly in the first half of the year, the NASDAQ, which is dominated by tech companies, experienced a significant drop of nearly 6% in September. This decline marked the worst month for the index in 2023. The previous performance of these stocks also shows that the tech sector has always remained sensitive to interest rates.When comparing, dividend stocks have consistently stayed reliable over time, even when the economy goes through ups and downs. Not only this, but dividend growth has also outpaced inflation over the years. In one of our articles, we referred to BlackRock’s data which revealed that U.S. companies increased their dividends by 3.7% annually from 1971 to 2022, while inflation only grew by 2% each year. We also mentioned that S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, whereas inflation only rose by 3.68% during that time. This indicates that dividends have been beating inflation consistently.Story continuesAlso Read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked By Yield: Top 25Investing in dividend stocks is important, but it's not as straightforward as it appears. Some companies pay dividends, but they haven't consistently kept up with them, and some have even reduced or stopped paying them altogether. For this reason, companies that consistently raise their dividends are favored by investors. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks that have raised their payouts for decades, becoming top choices for investors.

It generates consistent, predictable cash flows with over 80% of its revenues being annuity-like. RSG holds almost 25% of the landfill capacity in the U.S. Industry consolidation and the limited availability of landfills, on top of high transportation costs, have created local duopolies for landfill owners in their respective markets and increased returns. We’re attracted to RSG’s leading position in a stable business with a high degree of recurring revenue, and we believe the company is at an inflection point with its pricing strategy and landfill asset utilization.
