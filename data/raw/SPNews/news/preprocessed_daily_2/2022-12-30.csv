Well, one fund that may not be worth investigating is Schwab International Core Equity (SICNX). SICNX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SICNX. Schwab International Core Equity made its debut in May of 2008, and since then, SICNX has accumulated about $592 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund's current manager, Wei Li, has been in charge of the fund since June of 2013.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of -0.27%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 1.31%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SICNX's standard deviation comes in at 20.34%, compared to the category average of 19.66%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 17.8% compared to the category average of 17.29%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.86, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. SICNX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -8.9, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SICNX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.86% compared to the category average of 1.15%. From a cost perspective, SICNX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab International Core Equity ( SICNX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab International Core Equity ( SICNX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NetApp NTAP, Avnet AVT, Broadcom AVGO and Texas Instruments TXN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Curb Market Volatility RiskThe broader equity market has been hammered by recession fears, inflationary pressure and soaring interest rates. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about the global economic recovery.The major stock indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500, have declined 9.5%, 34.7% and 20.6%, respectively, year to date (YTD).Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 30.2% of its value YTD.Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. Additionally, the sector is suffering from inflationary pressure, higher wages and currency fluctuations. Supply-chain disruptions due to an acute shortage of chips and several other components are affecting the profitability of the companies in the space.The aforementioned challenges are likely to persist in the near term, thereby negatively impacting the overall financial performances of the majority of tech stocks. We believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — NetApp, Avnet, Broadcom and Texas Instruments — amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.Story continuesA stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements. Dividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offer downside protection with a consistent increase in payouts.How to Identify Stocks?We ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks that have a dividend yield in excess of 2% with five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. Furthermore, we have narrowed down our search by considering stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

The company is well positioned to gain from data-driven digital and cloud transformations. Also, it is gaining from the higher clout of FAS hybrid arrays and storage systems portfolio. The rapid adoption of Azure NetApp Files, Amazon Web Services FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS is a tailwind. Recent collaborations with Kyndryl, NVIDIA and Alluxio bode well.NTAP has a dividend yield of 3.4% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 18%.

4,6aab5abc-386d-3a7c-9b46-6fdad90f0b1e,TXN,2022-12-30,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-texas-instruments-140002604.html,1672322402,STORY,['TXN'],"[Texas Instruments (TXN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -10.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Texas Instruments falls in, has lost 10%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 points to a change of +12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.02 indicates a change of -13.3% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TXN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Texas Instruments, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.97 billion and $18.39 billion estimates indicate +8.8% and -7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTexas Instruments reported revenues of $5.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.45 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Texas Instruments is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Texas Instruments. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Headwinds that are sure to buffet the markets with varying strength over the coming months include persistently high inflation, continued rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. These may be partially offset by a gradual reopening of the Chinese economy, as Beijing pulls back from its zero-COVID policies.Uncertainty is the only constant here. We don’t really know what will happen, and the current clouded picture makes forecasts even more difficult. As Yogi Bera was fond of saying, ‘it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.’ And right now, investors want to know about the future.Wall Street’s professional stock analysts are also looking toward the future – and they’re looking with an eye toward stocks that have been outperforming, and still have room to run. Now after the heavy market losses we’ve seen this year, ‘outperformance’ is a low bar – but RBC analyst Scott Hanold, who is ranked in the Top Ten of the Street’s analysts, is backing two stocks that managed to post robust gains this year. And he believes they each have potential to gain another 60% or more in 2023.Hanold is a top-ranked analyst whose record of success puts him head-and-shoulders above his peers. Over the past year, his recommendations have scored a 58% accuracy rate, and investors who followed them would have seen a 20% return.So let’s follow Hanold’s recommendations. We’ve looked up the latest data on these Buy-rated stocks from the TipRanks database, and we’ll add in some of Hanold’s comments.EQT Corporation (EQT)We’ll start in Pennsylvania, where Pittsburgh-based EQT operates as the largest of the independent ‘pure play’ natural gas producers on the US scene. The company’s assets are centered in the core of the natural gas-rich Appalachian region, and EQT is active in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. Its footprint in that region covers more than 1 million acres of land holdings and the company can boast of having some 20 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves.Story continuesOver the past year, while most stock sectors fell into the doldrums, natural gas firms were able to take advantage of rising prices and solid demand, twin factors that have supported the US gas industry. In the last reported quarter, 3Q22, net income came in at $683.7 million, a dramatic turnaround from the $1.97 billion loss reported in the year-prior period. The company had a net cash flow of $1.15 billion, up from $48 million in 3Q21.More recently, EQT has been hit by the freezing conditions which the company said caused a big temporary drop in production – of up to 30%. The shares dropped too following the news, but even factoring in the decline, EQT shares have gained 54% so far this year.The company uses its cash to return profits to shareholders, through a share repurchase program and a small dividend. The last declared dividend, of 15 cents per common share, was paid out on December 1; at this rate, it annualizes to 60 cents per share and yields a modest 1.76%. The company’s buyback authorization is currently set at $2 billion.In Hanold’s view, this company is strongly positioned to continue showing gains going forward, as it builds production to higher levels after facing supply chain headwinds earlier this year. The analyst writes: “EQT is not immune to the midstream and supply chain issues that are impacting Appalachia producers. It may take through mid-2023 to get back to the 500 Bcfe quarterly maintenance level but FCF should remain robust, and management appears committed to stock buybacks,” the 5-star analyst said. “EQT is well positioned with a large asset base focused in the Appalachian Basin. We think the company has some of the most economic natural gas assets in North America and benefits from low royalty rates, low operating costs, and premium geology.”Hanold has an Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, and his $55 price target implies an upside of 62% on the one-year time frame. (To watch Hanold’s track record, click here.)Overall, EQT maintains a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 13 recent reviews that include 11 to buy and just 2 to Hold. The shares are trading for $33.587and their $60.36 average price target indicates potential for a one-year gain of 78%.

Range is one of the major players in the Marcellus shale formation, which is spread across the Appalachian mountains of western New York State and Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. The Marcellus is the largest natural gas field in the United States, and Range has a leading position in it, of nearly one million acres in southwestern Pennsylvania.This extensive footprint in one of North America’s leading gas fields has put Range in a sound position to generate revenues, earnings, and cash. In the last quarterly financial release, for 3Q22, the company posted a top line of $1.11 billion, for an impressive 267% year-over-year gain, along with a non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.37. This EPS figure’s y/y gain was not as large as the revenue increase, but still strong at 163%. Range’s cash flow numbers were also robust during the quarter. The cash flow from operating activity was a company record, at $521 million.These results were supported by steady production, which averaged 2.13 Bcfe (billion cubic feet equivalent) per day. Approximately 70% of the production total was natural gas.Despite a recent pullback, the shares have provided returns of 38% in 2022. The company has supported its stock through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payments. In October of this year, Range’s Board increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, to a total of $1.5 billion. Hanold believes this is a sign the company is in a confident mood. Following the Q3 print, he wrote, “RRC stepped up conviction in its business with higher levels of buybacks and a big increase to its authorization. Debt reduction to $1.0-1.5 billion remains the priority but this can be achieved along with higher shareholder returns by early 2023. Management remains adamant that RRC shares remain attractive given the discount the stock trades to intrinsic value, which we agree.”Once again, we’re looking at a stock that this top analyst rates as Outperform (a Buy). His price target, which he’s set at $44, shows his confidence in a 75% upside potential in the next 12 months.Looking at the consensus breakdown, based on 5 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell, the analysts view this stock as a Moderate Buy. The average price target of $35.5 suggests a 42% increase from the current share price.

Growth in EFT Processing, epay and Money Transfer businesses are driving the stock. With its digital efforts and global expansions, the company has positioned itself for better returns in the future. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Headquartered in Leawood, KS, Euronet is a leading electronic payments provider. The company offers payment and transaction processing, and distribution solutions to financial institutions, retailers, consumers, and service providers. It has a market cap of $4.6 billion.Growth AheadThanks to Euronet’s systematic and strategic plan of action, the stock is expected to grow further in the coming days. Its earnings and revenue estimates give us an encouraging picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings per share is pegged at $6.34, signaling a 71.8% year-over-year increase, while our estimate suggests 72.5% growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.4 billion, indicating a 12.1% year-over-year rise, while our estimate suggests 11.8% growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s initiatives to boost its digital presence across countries are playing a crucial role in its growth. Moves like acquiring more clients for its Ren Payments Platform can increase utilization and set the company up for long-term growth. Per a recent deal, the platform is expected to work as the foundational technology for Indonesian digital bank Bank Neo Commerce or BNC’s digital payments transformation plan. This will bring more traffic to EEFT’s network.Euronets’ full-service payment provider epay recently launched an innovative QR code payment service with UnionPay, a major Chinese state-owned card payment network, in Europe. This move is expected to benefit epay’s strong distribution network and significantly increase Europe volumes. Going ahead, the segment is expected to witness higher transactions, and the expansion of digital media products and SaaS solutions.Story continuesWhile Europe contributes the lion’s share to Euronet’s top line, its expanding presence in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region will be a major growth driver. Our estimate for 2022 revenues from this region indicates 8% year-over-year growth. Further, our estimate for revenues from its North American business indicates 3.6% growth for this year.The EFT Processing segment is expected to continue witnessing significant increases in transaction volumes in the coming quarters, boosting profit levels. Adjusted EBITDA from the segment jumped 130.9% in 2021. Our estimate suggests the metric to be more than double this year.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that can play spoilsport. Rising expenses are weighing on EEFT's margins. Our estimate suggests 6% growth in the total operating costs for this year. Also, the forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 13.92X compares unfavorably with the industry average of 10.25X, triggering a concern regarding its valuation.Key Picks in FinanceSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are CI Financial Corp.

The estimate indicates 12.8% year-over-year growth.

Our estimate for Total Controlled, Affiliated Investment Income for 2022 suggests more than 220% year-over-year growth.Upper-middle market firms, with predictable operations having minimum risk and strong cash flows, are the major contributors to Owl Rock Capital’s solid portfolio health. Its diversified portfolio, with balanced weightage in different industries, is expected to ensure growth even in tough times. A hefty portion of its investments is in Senior Secured form, which can enable it to avoid the impacts of the recession.Story continuesThe company has a prudent inorganic growth story, with a far-sighted acquisition strategy. Deals like Baltimore Acquisition, Blue Owl Capital, the Wellfleet CLO business and others keep strengthening its portfolio, while generating substantial credit sources. It has solid merger and acquisition deals in the pipeline.ORCC’s dividend yield stands at 10.5%, much higher than the industry's average of 2.6%. It boasts a prudent capital deployment history in forms of share repurchases, and regular and supplemental dividend payments. The board of directors at the company increased regular dividends to 33 cents per share, up sequentially by 2 cents.Moreover, it introduced a supplemental dividend plan, where it intends to return a significant portion of excess earnings to investors. This shows the company’s confidence in its operations.ORCC’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings value stands at 7.1X, much lower than the industry average of 10.4X. This shows that the stock is undervalued and has more room left to run.Key RisksThere are a few factors that investors should keep in mind.Owl Rock Capital’s rising expenses might put pressure on margins. Our estimate for 2022 net operating expenses suggests more than 15% year-over-year growth. Also, a low return on equity compared with the industry can be worrisome. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive ORCC’s growth in the long term.Other Top-Ranked PlayersSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are CI Financial Corp.

10,fd1be6cd-754c-31ad-a43b-34a96b1a5e82,USB,2022-12-30,"With 67% ownership, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/67-ownership-u-bancorp-nyse-130033621.html,1672405233,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[If you want to know who really controls U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$109m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 3.3% of U.S. Bancorp. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with U.S. Bancorp , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Ultimately the future is most important.

( NYSE:WMT ) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  View our latest analysis for Walmart  Walmart Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Advisor, M. Biggs, sold US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$140 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$142). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 8.2% of M. Biggs's holding.Walmart insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

In total, insiders dumped US$9.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Walmart Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth close to US$380b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Walmart Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Walmart is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks,  we've identified 3 warning signs  with Walmart  and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Walmart Inc. WMT, Chico's FAS CHS, Shoe Carnival SCVL and Texas Roadhouse TXRH.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:These Retail Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying for 2023Decade-high inflation, increase in interest rates, and concerns about a looming recession, no doubt, have made consumers cautious this year. Consequently, sales at U.S. retailers dropped considerably last month, thanks to a broader pullback in consumer outlays.However, retail sales did bounce back during the holiday shopping season as consumers accommodated rising prices and latched onto steep discounts. The period from Nov 1 to Dec 24, which predominantly encompasses the holiday shopping season, saw retail sales climb 7.6% year over year, more than an expected 7.1% growth, per a Mastercard report.Some of the retail majors like Amazon.com, Inc. and Walmart Inc. were able to lure consumers by offering substantial discounts to do away with excess inventory. Such large discounts, undoubtedly, led to strong demand for all types of retail items, particularly during the five-day holiday period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.Notably, sales in the apparel and restaurant categories have jumped 4.4% and 15.1%, respectively, this holiday season, while online sales are up 10.6% compared to year-ago levels, added the Mastercard report. Moreover, retail sales during the cyber week soared nearly 11%, added a separate Mastercard SpendingPulse report, citing a businesstoday article.Meanwhile, consumer confidence has lately improved noticeably and that may certainly boost spending heading into the new year. And with households expected to continue spending, both in-store and online retailers are poised to benefit.Story continuesThe consumer confidence index climbed to 108.3 in December, up from November’s 101.4, and the highest reading since April, per the Conference Board. Lest we forget, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index too jumped to a preliminary reading of 59.1 in December from 56.8 in November.To top it, a resilient labor market and solid wage growth would certainly fuel spending, which is unquestionably a boon for retailers. Consumer spending, by the way, which accounts for the bulk of US economic activity, edged up in October.Thus, it would be judicious to invest in retailers like Chico's FAS, Shoe Carnival and Texas Roadhouse that not only have made the most of the holiday shopping season but also are positioned to gain next year, banking on encouraging spending trends.These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

17,e16f5753-851e-3b78-a48b-b6d557d470e2,WMT,2022-12-30,15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-companies-buying-back-stock-005623362.html,1672361783,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'NVDA', 'CI', 'PG', 'WMT', 'CMCSA', 'COP', 'MPC', 'MS', 'CVX']","[In this article, we take a look at 15 companies that are buying back stock. If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15.

Also, robust order and backlog levels along with effective pricing actions are expected to be beneficial in the quarters ahead.Steady demand in the industrial end market with strength in energy, mining and infrastructure markets, and robust municipal water businesses are benefiting its Fluid &amp; Metering Technologies segment. Solid business in semiconductor, analytical instrumentation, material processing and life sciences markets is supporting the Health &amp; Science Technologies segment.For the Fire, Safety &amp; Diversified product segment, solid momentum in dispensing business, supported by the delivery of North American project volume and continued strength in the global architectural paint market bode well.IDEX has been strengthening and expanding its businesses through asset additions for a while. The acquisition of Muon Group in November 2022, expanded IDEX’s growing platform of precision technology business within the Health &amp; Science Technologies segment. Also, the commercial synergy potential from the combined entities will likely boost offerings for new and existing customers.The company’s buyout of KZValve (May 2022) solidified fluid-management solutions in its Banjo Corporation business. The Nexsight, LLC acquisition and its WinCan, Envirosight, MyTana and Pipeline Renewal Technologies businesses (March 2022) drove IEX’s position in the intelligent water technologies market. Also, its purchase of Airtech Group, US Valve Corporation and other entities aided IEX’s Health &amp; Science Technology segment.IDEX remains committed to maximizing its shareholder returns. The company paid out dividends worth $132.2 million and repurchased shares worth $146.3 million during the first nine months of 2022. Its board also announced an 11% hike in its quarterly dividend rate in May 2022.However, IEX is experiencing weakness due to supply-related issues in the fire OEM market which in turn is affecting its Fire, Safety &amp; Diversified Products segment. The company is also facing challenges related to cost woes and higher discretionary expenses.Story continuesIn the  third quarter, IDEX’s cost of sales increased 10.5% and selling, general and administrative expenses grew 10% year over year. Escalating costs and supply-chain constraints might weigh on the stock’s performance in the near term.Given IDEX’s global presence, it is exposed to various environmental laws and regulations across the countries it operates in. Also, the company remains vulnerable to foreign currency and geopolitical issues. In third-quarter 2022, forex woes lowered Fluid &amp; Metering Technologies segment sales by 4%, Health &amp; Science Technologies segment revenues by 5% and Fire &amp; Safety/Diversified Products segment revenues by 6%. Forex woes are expected to lower sales by 5% in the fourth quarter and by 4% during 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, this current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 25.4% compared with the industry’s 17.4% rise.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:MRC Global Inc.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Monolithic Power has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MCHP has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MCHP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.42, while MPWR has a forward P/E of 27.51. We also note that MCHP has a PEG ratio of 0.70. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MPWR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.10.Another notable valuation metric for MCHP is its P/B ratio of 6.12. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MPWR has a P/B of 10.40.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCHP's Value grade of B and MPWR's Value grade of D.MCHP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MPWR, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MCHP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of the company underperformed the Zacks Computer – Peripheral Equipment industry and the S&amp;P 500 Index in the YTD period.Though the majority of the U.S. stock indices are in the negative territory YTD, the major concern for Logitech is softening demand for computer peripherals and accessories. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company registered a sales decline across the majority of its key product categories. With the reopening of economies and offices in the post-pandemic era, there has been an unanticipated shift in consumer buying patterns across the globe. The declining popularity of desktop PCs amid a rising trend for smaller, mobile computing devices, which feature touch interfaces, poses a threat to the company. Revenues from PC Webcams, Tablets and Other Accessories were down 36.3% and 32.9% year over year, respectively, in the last reported quarter.Beside these, Logitech is prone to the negative impacts of currency translation, as the company derives the highest portion of its revenues from outside the Americas. On top of that, adverse currency impacts, the ongoing political tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and inflationary pressure are posing risks for the company.Considering the current macroeconomic challenges, the company, during its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, kept its fiscal 2023 guidance unchanged. Logitech expects fiscal 2023 revenues to decline 4-8% in constant currency. It anticipates a non-GAAP operating income of $650-$750 million.Increased promotional spending, higher investment in retail point-of-sale marketing and industry-wide elevated component costs are likely to lower Logitech's margins and profits in the next few months. It is, therefore, advisable to stay away from this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock in the near term.Story continues3 Better Bets Than LogitechThough Logitech’s prospects might not appear appealing at the moment, there are several stocks in the technology sector that offer good investment opportunities right now. These stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Also, these stocks have outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector on a YTD basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Per the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with this favorable combination offer good investment opportunities.eGain Corporation EGAN is the leading provider of cloud customer engagement hub software. With a presence in North America, EMEA and the APAC, the Zacks Rank #1 company offers web customer interaction applications, social customer interaction applications and contact center applications.eGain solutions help improve customer experience, optimize service processes, and boost sales across the web, social and phone channels.

In the first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s Knowledge Hub solution was adopted by some major global clients, which include a leading global airline, a U.S.-based health and benefits service provider, and the Department of Taxation of one of the U.S. state governments.eGain Corporation Price and Consensus eGain Corporation Price and ConsensuseGain Corporation price-consensus-chart | eGain Corporation QuoteEGAN has a Growth Score of B.

The Zacks Rank #2 company continues to win back-to-back deals for offering unique cyber safety solutions, which ensure the blocking of attacks or malicious content. Its Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) offerings are witnessing robust growth.The growing adoption of SD-WAN solutions is a key growth driver for Fortinet in the long run.

MET have gained 14.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 9.4% increase. The Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite index have gained 3.4% and 0.2%, respectively, in the same time frame. With a market capitalization of $56.3 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 4.1 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowing premiums, continuous product launches, cost-cutting efforts and strong cash reserves continue to drive MET.MetLife, with a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a solid track record of beating estimates in each of the trailing seven quarters.Can MET Retain the Momentum?Premiums of MetLife continue to benefit on the back of a diversified insurance product suite. Its intensified focus on continuous product launches as well as the upgradation of existing ones through the addition of lucrative benefits is likely to boost premiums in the days ahead. Last month, MET introduced the Federal Legal plan, available across most U.S. states, for providing assistance to the members of the Federal Family in expected and unanticipated legal matters.Growing premiums bode well for MetLife since it accounts for a significant chunk of an insurer’s top line.MetLife resorts to an inorganic growth strategy through acquisitions and partnerships, which in turn, upgrades its capabilities and solidifies its nationwide presence.Tactical cost-curbing initiatives undertaken by MET are expected to provide an impetus to its bottom line. The strength of such efforts keeps management optimistic about achieving a direct expense ratio remaining below the targeted figure of 12.3% for 2022. MetLife does not shy away from divesting underperforming businesses to intensify concentration on growing business units that fetches higher return. Divesting unprofitable businesses is likely to generate increased free cash flows for MET with which the insurer can continue its spree of growth-related efforts.Story continuesA strong financial position remains an added advantage for MetLife. The insurer boasts sufficient growing cash reserves to cover its meager short-term obligations. Backed by continued financial strength, MET can steadily pursue prudent capital deployment moves via share buybacks and dividend hikes. Its dividend yield of 2.8% remains higher than the industry’s figure of 2.3%.The return on equity of MetLife stands at 13.6% as of Sep 30, 2022, ahead of the industry average of 8.4%. This denotes the insurer’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the insurance space are Radian Group Inc.

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15.

Solomon making the announcement in a memo to staff. Yahoo Finance has learned that the cuts could be up to 8% of Goldman's workforce. Our next guest got the initial scoop on the story, and she joins us now. We want to bring in Liz Hoffman, Semafor's business and finance editor. Liz, it's great to see you again. So let's talk about these cuts because as many as 4,000 jobs could be on the line. What can you tell us just in terms of the details of the cuts and what divisions they're likely to come from?LIZZ HOFFMAN: So it's going to be across the firm. You'll see them especially deeply in consumer banking. Goldman has spent the last five or six years trying to become a major Main Street banking player, and it really hasn't worked. And they're sort of dialing back a lot of that ambition. Part of this is just the head count sort of exploded over the last three years. They've added 10,000 or 11,000 people. Some of that is laying off the annual layoffs.During 2020, it was fairly insensitive to be firing people. Last year, everyone on Wall Street was making so much money, they didn't have to. So a little bit of just kind of yearly housekeeping, but this is the deepest cuts I can ever remember at Goldman. I've been covering the firm on and off for almost 10 years. They didn't even cut this deeply during the financial crisis. So this is a serious round of layoffs.JARED BLIKRE: How much of a black eye is this for the CEO David Solomon? Because you compare him to Lloyd Blankfein, the previous CEO, who almost seemed untouchable. This is a relatively new venture. Is this an admission of failure for the bank? Is this-- was it simply a case of bad timing? What's your view?Story continuesLIZZ HOFFMAN: I would start by noting that Lloyd ran a very different firm than David does, a very different Wall Street, very different environment. But yeah, this is a black eye. I mean, look, they were recommitted to the strategy not just six or eight months ago. So, and, you know, what I've been hearing in the last couple of weeks is that the numbers that are being floated individually for layoffs keep getting bigger, which suggests to me that not only is there a hole, but that they're still getting their arms around how big it is. So this is a real black eye, I think, for the administration there.And they're going to have to work hard, I think, to win back the trust of certainly senior partners. Goldman, as you'll remember, has a partnership, which is sort of in name only, but is this unique power center that CEOs at the firm do have to contend with in a way that the CEO, Jamie Dimon, doesn't. And they're about as riled up as I've ever seen them.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Liz, going off of that, just in terms of some of the questions that you think Solomon and the top executives at Goldman Sachs are going to face just about his strategic vision for the firm, given what's happened to Marcus over the last couple of years.LIZZ HOFFMAN: So the next six or eight weeks are going to be incredibly fraught for David. You know, he's going to start the new year with layoffs, serious layoffs. He's going to announce fourth quarter earnings, annual earnings, which, from a top line perspective, will be very good, $48, $49 billion. They're looking at their second best ever year of revenue. But you're going to see huge losses in consumer. I'm told also very sizable losses in asset management that are really going to bring down the P&amp;L for the year.So you're going to have earnings that aren't really going to impress anybody from a bottom line perspective. The next day, they're going to hand out bonuses internally that are going to be largely disappointing. You know, then David is going to go and host a partner retreat in Miami, where he's going to have to defend and lay out his go forward plan to the 450 or so partners at the firm.And then he's going to come back to New York and do an all day investor presentation, where he's going to have to make the same sort of promises and commitments to shareholders and say, listen, I know I was up here six months ago, a year ago, two years ago, telling you that the plan we had was the right one. Turns out it isn't. So look, David is a pretty deft manager. He's, I think, well respected by shareholders. He's certainly tilted the balance of the equities at Goldman more towards public stockholders since he took over than from internal constituencies. So he has a little bit of goodwill there, but this is a tightrope he's got to walk very carefully over the next two months.JARED BLIKRE: Could you compare Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley for us? I'm looking at the returns there. It looks like Goldman Sachs is down 10% for the year, Morgan Stanley actually down a little bit more. But you could say-- you could make the case that Morgan Stanley is trading above Goldman Sachs in terms of its book value. There are various metrics here.The reason I choose Morgan Stanley, of course, is because Goldman Sachs in a very similar situation. Both of them converted to bank holding companies over the global financial crisis. They didn't have that retail depositor base. Morgan Stanley went a different direction. Both were [INAUDIBLE] deposits at one point. How have their paths diverged? And is Morgan Stanley now being seen as perhaps a winner?LIZZ HOFFMAN: Absolutely. I mean, these are the two old legacy investment banks. They do still see each other as really fierce rivals in a lot of their businesses. But they almost don't bear any resemblance anymore. Certainly, both have big trading franchises and big merger franchises. But to your point-- and I don't know where the numbers are today, but Morgan Stanley trades at 1.6, 1.7 times its book value. Goldman is at about 1.1 or 1.2.And that really reflects investors' comfort level with Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley has gotten very big into these very safe, fee-based businesses. When James Gorman took over after the financial crisis, he said the future is money management, right? You just manage trillions of dollars. It's very sticky money. And you take 50, 75, 100 basis points right off the top every year. You know, and they've got $4 or $5 billion of profit when they turn on the lights on January 1 in that business.So, you know, I wrote a story for the Wall Street Journal about five or six years ago, looking at the legacy of that conversion, as you noted, to the bank holding company status, which really saved those two firms in 2008, gave them access to very cheap government loans. And I think I said they've both come to Main Street, but they're walking down different sides of the street. And you're really seeing now which route shareholders prefer.SEANA SMITH: And Liz, let's talk about what this all signals for 2023, because right now, we have banks slashing headcount. Goldman by far the most, at least, up until this point. But they're far from the only bank that has signaled or has said that they are going to be laying off workers or instituting a hiring freeze. And then of course, we also had the reports that bonuses could be slashed 30% to 40% for this year. What do you think this tells us about the year ahead for Wall Street?LIZZ HOFFMAN: Well, I think it's important to put bonuses in the perspective of revenue, right? So you're going to see bonuses come down 20%, 30%, 40% across different businesses. Most of these firms allocate bonuses based on, one, how did the firm do? Two, how did your division do? And three, how did you do? And so it's some waterfall. You know, and a lot of these firms had terrific years. And so you'll see it a little more in line with revenue. I would expect the cuts to be deeper at Goldman. We had reported that the partner bonus pool, which is entirely discretionary, set by David Solomon and his top deputies is down 50% this year.You know, and it's important to note that the last time I think, when I talked to people, that they were sort of this dyspeptic was 2008. But that was really-- that was an industry problem, right? It was across the street. And frankly, Goldman weathered it better than almost anybody. This is not that. This is a little bit of an own goal. And so I think there's only so much money to go around when you have these deep losses and these growth businesses. And David has made the decision to try to share a little more of that with public stockholders and get the return on equity up with the thinking that if the stock price goes up, it's good for everybody. But getting it there and dialing those levers up and down at the same time is very tricky.SEANA SMITH: Certainly going to be at least challenging first half of the year for Wall Street.

Suni Lee competed strictly in NCAA gymnastics since winning the Tokyo Olympic all-around, but she announced last month that this sophomore season will be her last for the Auburn Tigers. Lee plans to return to elite, Olympic-level gymnastics after this winter. She hasn’t announced her comeback meet, but she has plenty of time ahead of the most significant domestic competitions in August.Meanwhile, Simone Biles said in September that she plans to be at the Paris Olympics. She just has to decide whether that will be as an athlete or a spectator. Biles hasn’t provided further updates since but, as of the third quarter of this year, was still getting drug tested. That’s significant because if Biles does not withdraw her name from the testing pool, she is excused from the six-month waiting period to return to competition for athletes who leave and then re-enter the testing pool.Then there’s 2012 Olympic all-around champ Gabby Douglas. She last competed at the 2016 Rio Games, but reports — and a photo — from this fall indicated she has been training at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Texas, which produced Olympic all-around champions Carly Patterson and Nastia Liukin and reigning U.S. all-around champion Konnor McClain. Douglas hasn’t commented publicly, and her representative said Wednesday there is nothing new to report.What will Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone race? For the first time, McLaughlin-Levrone has a bye into the world championships as a reigning gold medalist. That means she can race the 400m hurdles at August’s worlds in Budapest without entering the event at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in July. Athletes with byes sometimes compete in other events at nationals. Mix that with her comments from this fall that she wants to add the flat 400m to her program — but not give up the hurdles, yet at least — and we have our burning question.Story continuesWhen McLaughlin-Levrone made those fall comments, no concrete decision had been made about a possible 400m/400m hurdles double bid in 2023 (or 2024). At worlds, the women’s 400m hurdles first round heats start 2 hours and 20 minutes before the women’s 400m semifinals. Top-level pros rarely race multiple times in one session in a distance longer than 200 meters at any meet.The Olympic schedule is accommodating as ever for a possible women’s 400m/400m hurdles double in 2024 (no woman has ever earned a medal in both races at one Olympics or worlds). For the first time in Olympic history, none of the rounds of those races take place on the same day at the Games. But doing both through the finals would still be a challenge: racing six consecutive days at the Olympics (and a seventh day at the end if adding the 4x400m relay).Will Caeleb Dressel compete in 2023, and if so, when? Dressel, who won five golds at the Tokyo Games, withdrew on unspecified medical grounds during June’s world championships after winning his first two finals. He hasn’t competed since and last provided an update on Sept. 4, saying he was happy, had not swum since worlds and missed swimming. He ended the social media post with the line, “I’ll be back.”The next major meet is the U.S. Championships from June 27-July 1, the qualifying meet for the world championships in Japan later in July. In Dressel’s absence, Olympic 200m fly champion Kristof Milak became the new world champion in the 100m fly, where Dressel holds the world record. In the 100m freestyle, where Dressel had been the world’s fastest man outside of the super-suit era, 18-year-old Romanian David Popovici won the world title and then broke the world record.Is Katie Ledecky headed for a Race of the Century? Swimming worlds may also produce the most anticipated head-to-head-to-head race in 18 years. The women’s 400m freestyle could pit Ledecky (reigning world champion) against Australian Ariarne Titmus (reigning Olympic champion) and 16-year-old Canadian phenom Summer McIntosh. This year, Titmus broke Ledecky’s world record but skipped a showdown with Ledecky at the world championships in prioritizing the Commonwealth Games. McIntosh took silver to Ledecky at worlds, becoming the fourth-fastest woman in history.The hype has been compared to the “Race of the Century,” when Michael Phelps, Aussie Ian Thorpe and Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband met in the 200m free at the 2004 Athens Games (won by Thorpe).Will Mikaela Shiffrin break one of Alpine skiing’s historic records? Shiffrin heads into 2023 in arguably her best form since her incredible 2018-19 season, winning her last four races across three different disciplines to reach 80 World Cup wins. She is two victories shy of Lindsey Vonn‘s female record and six away from Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark‘s overall record that has stood since he retired in 1989. Shiffrin getting to 87 would be the most significant accomplishment in American ski racing — outside of the Olympics — since her breakout world title at age 17 in 2013.Shiffrin is 27 years old and expects to compete at least through the 2026 Winter Games. If she gets to 87 World Cup wins in 2023, having averaged about eight victories per season, you have to start wondering whether 100 is possible.What happens with Russian athletes? Russians and Belarusians in most Olympic sports have been banned from international competition since the invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago. Olympic sports leaders have discussed since at least September how athletes who do not endorse the war could return in the future. The International Olympic Committee is not yet recommending the lifting of the bans, but did say it planned to explore the possibility of Russian athletes taking part in Olympic qualifying competitions in Asia rather than Europe.A key sport is gymnastics. Russian gymnasts won men’s and women’s team gold at the Tokyo Games. As rules currently stand, Russians must compete at their continental championships this year (April for Europe, May or June for Asia) to remain eligible to qualify full teams for the Paris Games.Will any U.S. beach volleyball gold medalist return? The Olympic beach volleyball qualifying window runs from January 2023 into June 2024. It looks likely to start with no public word from reigning gold medalists Alix Klineman and April Ross on whether either will bid for the Paris Games. Klineman, 32, hasn’t competed since shoulder surgery last January. Ross, 40, last competed in March, then withdrew before June’s world championships, where she was entered with Emily Day, with an unspecified injury.“I’m weighing a lot of factors, a lot of life factors, a lot of, you know, opportunity factors,” Ross said earlier this month. “There’s a lot of things that are appealing to me at the moment, and I just have to decide which direction I want to go. But yeah, I still feel like I have a lot of good years of volleyball left in me.”Kerri Walsh Jennings, the most decorated Olympic beach volleyball player with four medals (three gold), has been working out on Hermosa Beach with 2000 Olympic indoor teammate Logan Tom, according to videos posted by Buzzle this month. Walsh Jennings, 44, last played a tournament in June 2021, when she and then-partner Brooke Sweat were eclipsed for the second and last U.S. spot for the Tokyo Games. Walsh Jennings said last spring that she wanted Tom to be her new partner, then said in October that she should have an answer on her 2024 Olympic bid plans after the start of the new year.The gold medalists have some time to deliberate, but probably need to return at some point in 2023 or risk falling significantly behind in qualifying for two Olympic spots. The U.S. has two strong, younger pairs in Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, who won the most recent top-level international event earlier this month, and Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, who won five times between the domestic AVP and international FIVB tours in 2022.Will Stephen Curry join Steve Kerr at the 2023 FIBA World Cup? (Getty)Which NBA superstars will suit up for USA Basketball? The U.S. men’s basketball team may face a gigantic threat at the Paris Games (more on that in the next burning question), but first comes the quadrennial FIBA World Cup in August and September. Recall four years ago that the Americans, with just two reigning NBA All-Stars on the team and one player with Olympic experience, lost twice at the World Cup en route to their worst major tournament result ever — seventh place.After Gregg Popovich coached the team to a bounce-back gold in Tokyo, Steve Kerr succeeded him as head coach. Grant Hill followed Jerry Colangelo as national team managing director. Will America’s best players sign up to travel around the globe — the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia co-host worlds — a month before NBA preseason training camps?Which country will Joel Embiid play for? The Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center, who was born in Cameroon, gained French nationality and U.S. citizenship this year, potentially making him eligible to represent any of those nations in international basketball. Embiid has not yet announced his choice, if he decides to play at all, but France’s GM expressed confidence last month.If Embiid joins France, it could give the Olympic host country triplet towers with fellow 7-footers Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, an 18-year-old whom LeBron James described as a one-of-a-kind talent. That could pose problems for the U.S. Anthony Davis, who skipped the Tokyo Olympics, is the lone U.S. center to make an All-NBA first, second or third team in the last five seasons.Can Kelly Slater qualify for Olympic surfing at age 51? Many thought surfing’s debut in Tokyo was Slater’s only shot at the Olympics. He missed the team by one spot when it came down to the last event of yearlong qualifying. Then Slater came back in February to win the most prestigious contest in the sport — the Pipeline Masters — 30 years after he won it for the first time. Slater didn’t make the quarterfinals of any other event and finished the 2022 season ranked fifth among American men in world standings.The top two American men in next year’s standings likely qualify for the Olympics. In a change from Tokyo, the U.S. has the chance to earn a third Olympic men’s spot if it wins the 2024 World Surfing Games. That spot can be filled via discretionary pick.Will the 2030 Winter Olympic and Paralympic host be decided? The IOC announced earlier this month that the 2030 host is no longer expected to be decided before next fall, citing wider discussions into the future of the Winter Games, including the effects of climate change and the possibility of rotating the Games within a pool of hosts.Previously, Salt Lake City, Sapporo, Japan, and Vancouver were confirmed as bids. Then in October, the British Columbia government said it would not support a Vancouver bid, a major setback, though organizers did not say that decision ended the bid. Then last week, Japanese officials announced a pause in the active promotion of the Sapporo bid that may include a national survey asking the public whether it wants to host the Games.U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee officials have said Salt Lake City is a likelier candidate for 2034 than 2030 — with Los Angeles already hosting the 2028 Summer Games — but could step in for 2030 if asked.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

(NYSE:CRM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 79%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-favorite-120026641.html,1672401626,STORY,['CRM'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce. View our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Salesforce does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Salesforce's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Salesforce is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 4.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$4.2b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Salesforce. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.05%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 7.84%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the energy company had lost 13.22% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 3.11% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.4% in that time.Marathon Oil will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.97, up 25.97% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.82 billion, up 0.95% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.56 per share and revenue of $8.14 billion, which would represent changes of +190.45% and +48.87%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The spreadsheet software updates are centered around web users, which cover all Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) users, even those without access to the full desktop clients.The first change for web users is the introduction of formula suggestions, which take into account contextual data to suggest a handful of supported formulas, including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, COUNTA, MIN and MAX.Secondly, the company has introduced Formula by Example, which is similar to the Flash Fill feature. After a user completes a series of similar entries, the web version of Excel can automatically detect and suggest content for remaining cells based on their previous actions or patterns.Further improvements include a tool that can detect broken cloud workbook links so that the data in your spreadsheet remains up-to-date and functioning and a new search bar in the queries pane for quicker navigation.Excel has rolled out a function for adding images with alt-text into tables coming to Windows, Mac and web; and the company is also adding nested Power Query data types and the ability to get data from dynamic arrays to the Insider version of the Windows app for testing.These endeavors are expected to further boost demand for the company’s 365 suite which has already witnessed robust adoption in the preceding quarters. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, Office 365 commercial revenues rallied 11% (up 17% at cc), driven by Office 365 Commercial seat growth of 14%.

Cisco will become a partner in the Certified for Microsoft Teams program for the first time.Another significant collaboration of Microsoft was closed with Meta Platforms META, where Microsoft Teams will integrate with Meta’s Quest devices and provide a way to stream Windows apps to Meta’s Quest Pro VR headsets. This will let Microsoft expand its reach to Meta’s large audience.As part of the collaboration, Microsoft will enter a new productivity-focused virtual reality and augmented reality program with Meta. This will let Microsoft bring some of its most popular remote-working software to the Metaverse, gaining traction from Metaverse users.Independent Service Vendors like Adobe and Workday have built deep integrations with Teams.

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Signet (SIG) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 1.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this jewelry company well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. SIG meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 11.6% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for SIG is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.18. This indicates that the stock moves 118% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that SIG has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped SIG earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, SIG is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. SIG is currently trading at 0.38 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 38 cents for each dollar of sales.So, SIG appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to SIG, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 5, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.1%.Revenues are expected to be $32.96 billion, down 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?For Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.80, delivering a surprise of +2.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walgreens doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.75%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.05%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 7.84%.Heading into today, shares of the coffee chain had lost 3.52% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 5.68% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.4% in that time.Starbucks will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Starbucks to post earnings of $0.76 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.79 billion, up 9.19% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.41 per share and revenue of $35.97 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.2% and +11.54%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.31% higher. Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Starbucks's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 28.88. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 20.63, so we one might conclude that Starbucks is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that SBUX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.09. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Retail - Restaurants stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.17 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 160, putting it in the bottom 37% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The company is making changes to its rewards program. Some customers might not be happy because it will be tougher to score freebies with stars. Those are the points. So under the new program, let's talk about it. Members will need 100 stars to get a free hot coffee, bakery item, packaged snack, or a plastic to-go cup. That's up from 50 stars.But there is a bit of good news in this, and iced coffee drinkers are going to be very happy because iced coffees and tea are now included in that 100 star reward. The next tier, 200 stars, that's going to get you a latte, a frappuccino, any hot breakfast item. 300 is going to get you a packaged salad, a lunch sandwich, or a protein box, as well as packaged coffee. That's down from 400 to 300.So, Jared, some changes in here. The 50 to 100, the hot coffee, which I always get, I'm not too pleased that it's going to make me wait till I get 100 stars at this point. But we certainly know iced coffee is on trend right now. A lot of people love their iced coffees.JARED BLIKRE: Who doesn't [INAUDIBLE]?SEANA SMITH: That's now going to qualify.JARED BLIKRE: So let me get this straight. They're basically-- inflation is taking a toll on all of us. And beyond that, beyond the purchase price that you pay, they're going to reduce the value of their own rewards program by up to 50%. If Jerome Powell did that, we'd be up in arms here. I can tell you. But--SEANA SMITH: I'm up in arms about it.JOSH SCHAFER: It's after price hikes earlier this year, too, Jared. And you're talking $1 a star, so it's 100-- you're spending $100 before you get a free coffee.JARED BLIKRE: The math doesn't--SEANA SMITH: Which you do quicker than you would think at Starbucks, given the prices these days.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Unfortunately, we all do, right? Unfortunately, we all spend $100.JARED BLIKRE: [INAUDIBLE] you're up there. OK, I got it.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. Lots of questions, but I guess, business wise, it makes a sense for Starbucks at this point. All right, well, coming up, inflation has been catching up with consumers. We're going to tell you which retailers stand to benefit after the break.]"

Anyone who connects purchases to a Starbucks app will earn one star for every dollar spent. One can redeem 25 stars for a shot of espresso or syrup, 50 stars for a hot coffee or small bakery item, 150 for a handcrafted drink, like a Frappuccino or Refresher, or a hot breakfast item, and 200 for a larger food item.Continue reading]"

Starbucks told Yahoo Finance, ""We occasionally need to make changes to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Starbucks Rewards program and to meet the changing needs of our members.""Effective February 13, reward members will need 100 stars, up from 50, to get a free hot or iced coffee, tea, bakery item, packaged snack or a plastic to-go cup. Previously, iced coffee or tea was not included in this level.The next tier is 200 stars, formerly 150, to score a handcrafted beverage like a latte, Frappuccino, or any hot breakfast item. To round out the updates, 300-star customers can get a packaged salad, lunch sandwich, or protein box. The 300-star tier will also include packaged coffee (a bag of whole beans to make at home), which was previously 400 stars.This is the first structural change for members since 2019. 'Untapped opportunities' to grow the rewards programThe changes come after the company said earlier this year that it had raised prices by about 5% over a 12-month period. Interim CEO Howard Schultz said in the fiscal-fourth quarter earnings call in early November, ""Our convenience channels, drive-thru, Mobile Order &amp; Pay, and delivery drove 72% of our total sales volume."" He added, the company expects mobile, digital, loyalty, and delivery to ""to continue to grow and drive"" the business.An example of Starbucks' digital push: This week, Yahoo Finance spotted one location in Long Island, New York (pictured above) that is exclusively for mobile order, drive-thru or pick-up only. No in-person orders are accepted, rather customers have to order on the app and then grab their drink(s) and bakery item(s) off the ledge once ready. Drive-thru is also an option for customers.The free birthday drink staysCustomers that use a Starbucks card on the app will continue to earn 2 stars for every dollar spent, with the ability to earn ""bonus stars"" on games and personalized offers on ""Double Star Days."" Members can still use the reusable cup perk, which provides 25 stars to Starbucks rewards members. That program re-launched earlier this year. Customers can also grab free refills of hot or iced coffee and tea in the stores.Story continuesAnd the free Birthday Reward is here to stay. Schultz added, in his fourth-quarter earnings call: Rewards members ""drove a record 55% of tender in our US company-operated stores in Q4 ... We have significant untapped opportunities to grow our rewards program in a very unique way.""This decision to keep this promotion for Starbucks' reward members comes after Dunkin' faced backlash over getting rid of the free beverage offer on customers; birthdays. Dunkin' replaced it it with ""3X POINTS"" on any purchases made during the day before, on, and and after customers' birthday.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the details. Brooke.BROOKE DI PALMA: That's right, Brian. Just to give you the skinny of it, 50 stars is now 100 stars. 150 stars is now 200 stars. And 200 stars now 300 stars. So what exactly does that mean for customers? Well, Starbucks certainly continuing to bet big on iced here. Of course, in previous earnings calls, we heard that iced is now hot. And so iced coffee and iced tea will now cost customers 100 stars, be a part of that first tier stars option there, along with hot beverages.But one thing that customers don't seem too happy about, a free handcrafted beverage-- of course that's a latte or a frappuccino-- will now cost 200 stars, as opposed to the current 150 stars. Packaged coffee-- that's the whole beans bag-- coming down a bit, at 300 stars. And of course, merchandise also coming down, about 100 stars, as Starbucks really looks to bet big on mobile pay and order.In the last quarterly results, Howard Schultz, of course, interim CEO, said that drive-thru, convenience channels, mobile order and pay drove 72% of total sales volume. And also, 55% of US company owned stores in Q4 had those reward members using the app in order to pay for their beverage. So Starbucks certainly looking to make some changes here. It did tell Yahoo Finance in an email that they occasionally do make these changes to ensure long-term sustainability for the Starbucks rewards program. But of course, bottom line here, customers will be paying more for free beverages.BRAD SMITH: Look, Brooke, I'm asking for a friend whose name rhymes with Lion Mozzi, and he just wants to know if his birthday reward is going to stick around.Story continuesBROOKE DI PALMA: Well, Brad, Starbucks here perhaps taking a page out of Dunkin's playbook. The free birthday reward at Starbucks is here to stay. Of course Dunkin' president telling Yahoo Finance in October 2022 that you now will get three times the point as opposed to a free beverage at Dunkin', and that they're certainly thinking about that option, but no updates made at Dunkin'. Starbucks, on the other hand, learning from that huge backlash from companies-- customers, rather, and keeping that free beverage option.Also, 25 stars-- of course, that's for syrup and milk alternatives-- that's staying. The 400 star tier level staying as well. And of course, Starbucks sticking to their roots here. For every dollar spent, you will get two stars. That is not changing. All these changes, I should say, will go into effect February of 2023. So certainly, if you have some stars waiting, maybe time to cash in now.BRIAN SOZZI: Hey, Brooke, while we have you, I'm getting a question in from my friend Rad Smythe. He's curious on-- do you think this is a good opportunity for Dunkin'? Because might this be a great marketshare opportunity for Dunkin', which really hasn't made these types of aggressive changes? Sure, they have changed the rewards program, but this might be a good opportunity for them.BROOKE DI PALMA: Yeah, well, it's hard to say, Brian, in terms of just Starbucks really sticking to the coffee here and certainly betting big on ice. But Dunkin' certainly coming in hot, I guess you could say as well, on iced beverages. We saw them certainly giving a run for their money last quarter in terms of their holiday sales, introducing new and even more iced options.But in terms of rewards, I would say that maybe now would be the time for Dunkin' to walk back on that birthday reward. But like I said before, we heard from the Dunkin' president in October of 2022. Now, nearly two months later, no update made to that birthday reward. So I guess we'll have to wait and see, but customers certainly not liking paying more at either places for those freebies.BRAD SMITH: All right, excellent coverage there and reporting from our own Brooke DiPalma. Tweet at her with the tree if you agree, everyone. Thanks so much for the time this morning. Brooke, appreciate it.]"
71,86375a4b-09d2-337e-bc4b-1d874693f1b2,PH,2022-12-30,Is Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Trading At A 33% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parker-hannifin-corporation-nyse-ph-135409249.html,1672322049,STORY,['PH'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.44bUS$2.69bUS$3.02bUS$3.45bUS$3.78bUS$4.02bUS$4.22bUS$4.40bUS$4.55bUS$4.69bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.38%Est @ 5.06%Est @ 4.14%Est @ 3.49%Est @ 3.04% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.0%) = US$72bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$72b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$32bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$55b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$287, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Parker-Hannifin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.186. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Parker-HannifinStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

72,ba738361-ac21-3354-839e-c9c291afd33c,SYY,2022-12-30,11 Best Stocks to Buy for Deflation,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-stocks-buy-deflation-190606188.html,1672340766,STORY,"['USFD', 'ADP', 'SYY', 'RY', 'KO', 'MMM', 'ATO']","[In this article, we discuss the 11 best stocks to buy for deflation. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, click  5 Best Stocks To Buy For Deflation.The swift economic rebound from the Covid shock unleashed the biggest inflationary wave we have witnessed since the early 1980s, according to The New York Times. Central banks started hiking interest rates in the summer of 2021 in response. Lead nation was Brazil. Early in 2022, the Federal Reserve stepped in, starting a bandwagon effect: As soon as the Fed acts and the dollar gains, other nations either hike their interest rates or risk a sudden devaluation, which fuels inflation even more. The world hasn't witnessed monetary policy tightening on such a massive scale in recent decades as it is doing right now. The interest rate increases currently involve many more central banks, even though they are not as significant as those Paul Volcker, the Fed chief after 1979, pushed through.Additionally, Covid-era stimulus programs are being phased out in favor of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce deficits and reduce demand in the economy, adding to the disinflationary push. According to a Brookings Institution analysis, the so-called ""fiscal drag"" in the US will cause the economy to contract by more than 3.4 percent of GDP in the third quarter.Right now, deflation isn't on anybody's radar as everyone is concerned about inflation.  However, we already know that technological improvements in several areas are deflationary and a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence and robotics over the coming years may cause a huge decline in human labor demand. In the near-term central bank over-tightening is the real risk factor in terms of deflation. Central bank policies take effect with a delay and they may increase the interest rates longer than necessary and don't act in time to reduce them.In any case you will notice that several of the best stocks for deflation are also very good investments during inflationary and recessionary times.Story continuesBest Stocks To Buy For DeflationOur MethodologyWe selected defensive, cash-rich stocks with a strong history of paying dividends. These businesses are most likely to survive deflation and continue dividend payments, which is attractive for shareholders as deflation ultimately leads to high unemployment. The demand for the businesses selected for this list will remain robust despite an economic slowdown.We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2022 database of about 920 elite hedge funds.Best Stocks to Buy for Deflation11.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Xcel Energy, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$60b - US$4.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Xcel Energy has an ROCE of 4.2%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 4.6% average generated by the Electric Utilities industry. View our latest analysis for Xcel Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Xcel Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Xcel Energy's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 4.2% from 5.7% five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.In Conclusion...Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Xcel Energy. Furthermore the stock has climbed 72% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.Story continuesXcel Energy does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those doesn't sit too well with us...While Xcel Energy isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Come 2023 and the increased inflationary landscape, food stocks with efficient pricing and saving strategies will likely do well. As we are about to wrap up 2022, we have pointed out a few food stocks that look well placed for the new year, thanks to favorable demand and solid pricing strategies.Increased at-home consumption habits formed since the pandemic has been working for the retail operations of several food companies. Their foodservice businesses have also been witnessing higher sales, with people heading out and returning to routine. The companies have been making the most of the rising demand through constant brand-building efforts, including consumer-centric innovation and acquisitions. Companies have been particularly investing in healthy offerings, given consumers’ rising inclination toward health and wellness (all the more since the pandemic).Additionally, companies have been going all out to battle inflationary headwinds. Food companies have been grappling with an increased cost of ingredients, packaging and transportation. The increased cost of labor due to shortages has also been a downside. Players have been raising product prices and undertaking stronger saving and restructuring measures to combat these challenges.All said, we have picked three well-ranked food stocks with a market cap of at least $1 billion using the Zacks Stock Screener. These stocks also flaunt a Value Score of A, making them all the more appetizing. With strong fundamentals and robust potential, these food stocks are likely to add flavor to investors’ new year palettes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research3 Delicacies for 2023Conagra Brands, Inc.

The adjusted EPS growth is envisioned at 1-5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Conagra’s fiscal 2023 earnings per share has increased a penny to $2.48 over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 3.8% from the year-ago reported figure.

(NYSE:PM) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$8.3m worth of shares, at about US$111 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$101. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Philip Morris International Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$198m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Philip Morris International shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Philip Morris International, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Solomon making the announcement in a memo to staff. Yahoo Finance has learned that the cuts could be up to 8% of Goldman's workforce. Our next guest got the initial scoop on the story, and she joins us now. We want to bring in Liz Hoffman, Semafor's business and finance editor. Liz, it's great to see you again. So let's talk about these cuts because as many as 4,000 jobs could be on the line. What can you tell us just in terms of the details of the cuts and what divisions they're likely to come from?LIZZ HOFFMAN: So it's going to be across the firm. You'll see them especially deeply in consumer banking. Goldman has spent the last five or six years trying to become a major Main Street banking player, and it really hasn't worked. And they're sort of dialing back a lot of that ambition. Part of this is just the head count sort of exploded over the last three years. They've added 10,000 or 11,000 people. Some of that is laying off the annual layoffs.During 2020, it was fairly insensitive to be firing people. Last year, everyone on Wall Street was making so much money, they didn't have to. So a little bit of just kind of yearly housekeeping, but this is the deepest cuts I can ever remember at Goldman. I've been covering the firm on and off for almost 10 years. They didn't even cut this deeply during the financial crisis. So this is a serious round of layoffs.JARED BLIKRE: How much of a black eye is this for the CEO David Solomon? Because you compare him to Lloyd Blankfein, the previous CEO, who almost seemed untouchable. This is a relatively new venture. Is this an admission of failure for the bank? Is this-- was it simply a case of bad timing? What's your view?Story continuesLIZZ HOFFMAN: I would start by noting that Lloyd ran a very different firm than David does, a very different Wall Street, very different environment. But yeah, this is a black eye. I mean, look, they were recommitted to the strategy not just six or eight months ago. So, and, you know, what I've been hearing in the last couple of weeks is that the numbers that are being floated individually for layoffs keep getting bigger, which suggests to me that not only is there a hole, but that they're still getting their arms around how big it is. So this is a real black eye, I think, for the administration there.And they're going to have to work hard, I think, to win back the trust of certainly senior partners. Goldman, as you'll remember, has a partnership, which is sort of in name only, but is this unique power center that CEOs at the firm do have to contend with in a way that the CEO, Jamie Dimon, doesn't. And they're about as riled up as I've ever seen them.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Liz, going off of that, just in terms of some of the questions that you think Solomon and the top executives at Goldman Sachs are going to face just about his strategic vision for the firm, given what's happened to Marcus over the last couple of years.LIZZ HOFFMAN: So the next six or eight weeks are going to be incredibly fraught for David. You know, he's going to start the new year with layoffs, serious layoffs. He's going to announce fourth quarter earnings, annual earnings, which, from a top line perspective, will be very good, $48, $49 billion. They're looking at their second best ever year of revenue. But you're going to see huge losses in consumer. I'm told also very sizable losses in asset management that are really going to bring down the P&amp;L for the year.So you're going to have earnings that aren't really going to impress anybody from a bottom line perspective. The next day, they're going to hand out bonuses internally that are going to be largely disappointing. You know, then David is going to go and host a partner retreat in Miami, where he's going to have to defend and lay out his go forward plan to the 450 or so partners at the firm.And then he's going to come back to New York and do an all day investor presentation, where he's going to have to make the same sort of promises and commitments to shareholders and say, listen, I know I was up here six months ago, a year ago, two years ago, telling you that the plan we had was the right one. Turns out it isn't. So look, David is a pretty deft manager. He's, I think, well respected by shareholders. He's certainly tilted the balance of the equities at Goldman more towards public stockholders since he took over than from internal constituencies. So he has a little bit of goodwill there, but this is a tightrope he's got to walk very carefully over the next two months.JARED BLIKRE: Could you compare Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley for us? I'm looking at the returns there. It looks like Goldman Sachs is down 10% for the year, Morgan Stanley actually down a little bit more. But you could say-- you could make the case that Morgan Stanley is trading above Goldman Sachs in terms of its book value. There are various metrics here.The reason I choose Morgan Stanley, of course, is because Goldman Sachs in a very similar situation. Both of them converted to bank holding companies over the global financial crisis. They didn't have that retail depositor base. Morgan Stanley went a different direction. Both were [INAUDIBLE] deposits at one point. How have their paths diverged? And is Morgan Stanley now being seen as perhaps a winner?LIZZ HOFFMAN: Absolutely. I mean, these are the two old legacy investment banks. They do still see each other as really fierce rivals in a lot of their businesses. But they almost don't bear any resemblance anymore. Certainly, both have big trading franchises and big merger franchises. But to your point-- and I don't know where the numbers are today, but Morgan Stanley trades at 1.6, 1.7 times its book value. Goldman is at about 1.1 or 1.2.And that really reflects investors' comfort level with Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley has gotten very big into these very safe, fee-based businesses. When James Gorman took over after the financial crisis, he said the future is money management, right? You just manage trillions of dollars. It's very sticky money. And you take 50, 75, 100 basis points right off the top every year. You know, and they've got $4 or $5 billion of profit when they turn on the lights on January 1 in that business.So, you know, I wrote a story for the Wall Street Journal about five or six years ago, looking at the legacy of that conversion, as you noted, to the bank holding company status, which really saved those two firms in 2008, gave them access to very cheap government loans. And I think I said they've both come to Main Street, but they're walking down different sides of the street. And you're really seeing now which route shareholders prefer.SEANA SMITH: And Liz, let's talk about what this all signals for 2023, because right now, we have banks slashing headcount. Goldman by far the most, at least, up until this point. But they're far from the only bank that has signaled or has said that they are going to be laying off workers or instituting a hiring freeze. And then of course, we also had the reports that bonuses could be slashed 30% to 40% for this year. What do you think this tells us about the year ahead for Wall Street?LIZZ HOFFMAN: Well, I think it's important to put bonuses in the perspective of revenue, right? So you're going to see bonuses come down 20%, 30%, 40% across different businesses. Most of these firms allocate bonuses based on, one, how did the firm do? Two, how did your division do? And three, how did you do? And so it's some waterfall. You know, and a lot of these firms had terrific years. And so you'll see it a little more in line with revenue. I would expect the cuts to be deeper at Goldman. We had reported that the partner bonus pool, which is entirely discretionary, set by David Solomon and his top deputies is down 50% this year.You know, and it's important to note that the last time I think, when I talked to people, that they were sort of this dyspeptic was 2008. But that was really-- that was an industry problem, right? It was across the street. And frankly, Goldman weathered it better than almost anybody. This is not that. This is a little bit of an own goal. And so I think there's only so much money to go around when you have these deep losses and these growth businesses. And David has made the decision to try to share a little more of that with public stockholders and get the return on equity up with the thinking that if the stock price goes up, it's good for everybody. But getting it there and dialing those levers up and down at the same time is very tricky.SEANA SMITH: Certainly going to be at least challenging first half of the year for Wall Street. Liz Hoffman, as always, thanks so much for joining us here on Yahoo Finance today.]"

(Photo by Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)The bank employed 49,100 people at the end of the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing, up from 43,000 during the same period last year following a ramp up in hiring throughout 2021 as dealmaking activity boomed after the height of the pandemic.The layoff discussions come after a substantial slowdown in bank profits this year, with market volatility slashing investment banking revenue — and as many companies reduce their workforces to cut costs in anticipation of a potential recession.At the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit earlier this month, Solomon acknowledged the banking industry’s aggressive hiring last year and in 2020 to keep up with record dealmaking activity during the period.“It’s a natural phenomenon that you therefore have to trim in some areas and pull back, and so we’re going through the process of thinking about how we’re going to do that,” Solomon said. “But for sure, we’ll have to narrow our footprint a little bit.”In an earnings call earlier this year, Goldman Sachs said it would reinstate annual performance reviews paused during the pandemic, a strategy that has historically served to weed out laggard bankers — in addition to slowing hiring. A reduction of up to 8% would go beyond its typical annual cull of low performers.Story continuesPeers in the financial industry have also discussed or delivered layoffs. Morgan Stanley (MS) has reportedly cut about 2% of its workforce this month, while Citigroup (C) has also let some workers go, though the latter noted that it was merely part of usual yearly culling.JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) have taken a more cautious approach to potential job cuts.""You need to be very careful when you have a bit of a downturn to start cutting bankers here and there, because you will hurt the possibility for growth going forward,"" JPMorgan President and Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto said during an investor conference in September.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at a conference earlier this month that his institution will not lay people off but rather let natural attrition occur and let open positions go unfilled, or fill them internally.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Today’s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including ServiceNow, Inc., Schlumberger, Ltd. and MetLife, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of ServiceNow have lagged the Zacks Tech sector (-40.7% vs. -39.1%) and the S&amp;P 500 index (-40.7% vs. -22.3%) over the past year. Negative sentiment on the stock and other 'growthy' Tech stocks in the wake of the Fed's extraordinary tightening cycle is the primary reason for its underperformance. The Zacks analyst has also flagged high inflation, unfavorable forex and challenging macro-economic environment, in addition to stiff competition, as some of the other headwinds.However, ServiceNow did benefit from robust growth in subscription revenues as reflected by the strong third-quarter 2022 results. The company is riding on the increasing adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. Further, its expanding global presence, solid partner base and strategic buyouts are expected to bolster growth prospects. Strategic alliances with the likes of Microsoft remain tailwinds.(You can read the full research report on ServiceNow here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Schlumberger shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+76.4% vs. +56.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that Schlumberger, being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets. The significant increase in oil prices is aiding its overall business. Increased participation in growth of drilling and completion activities across the world brightened the company’s outlook.Story continuesAlso, it boasts of becoming the first company in the energy service industry to add Scope 3 emissions ambition in the net-zero emission target.  However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the aggressive capital spending budget remains a headwind for the company.(You can read the full research report on Schlumberger here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of MetLife have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry over the past year (+14.8% vs. -1.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that MetLife continues to be driven by growing premiums, an ongoing expense discipline and the benefits of its diverse set of market-leading businesses and capabilities.Several accretive acquisitions led to business diversification and solidified inorganic growth for the company. It resorts to partnerships for strengthening its capabilities and global presence. Business streamlining has aligned MET with high-growth operations.

The Zacks analyst has also flagged high inflation, unfavorable forex and challenging macro-economic environment, in addition to stiff competition, as some of the other headwinds.However, ServiceNow did benefit from robust growth in subscription revenues as reflected by the strong third-quarter 2022 results.

With safety becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. Aptiv is well-positioned to leverage on growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.The recent acquisition of Wind River Studio will enable APTV to give a quicker and cost-effective access to full-vehicle software architecture to its clients, expand to multiple industries, and transform into an edge-enabled, software-defined future.Aptiv PLC Revenue (TTM)Aptiv PLC Revenue (TTM)Aptiv PLC revenue-ttm | Aptiv PLC QuoteAptiv has a sound liquidity position.

95,bfff46cd-8433-39cb-baa2-8093e91abb67,AIG,2022-12-30,Those who invested in American International Group (NYSE:AIG) three years ago are up 33%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-american-international-group-171906365.html,1672334346,STORY,['AIG'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), which is up 22%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 13% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 13% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for American International Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.American International Group was able to grow its EPS at 109% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 3.40.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American International Group has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of American International Group, it has a TSR of 33% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that American International Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 13% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 4% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  American International Group is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...But note: American International Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

HOLX is gaining from the continued strength of the GYN Surgical business. The company’s earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, declining sales and weak margins do not bode well.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 8.2% compared with the 4.2% rise of the industry and the 0.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $18.42 billion. Its earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.3%. Hologic’s long-term expected growth is estimated at 15.2% compared with the industry’s growth expectation of 16.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ4 Upsides: Hologic delivered better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company’s molecular diagnostics and Surgical businesses grew strong in the quarter.Excluding the COVID-19 impact, the molecular diagnostics business grew, primarily on more assays being run through the company’s expanded Panther installed base. This growth was once again broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in the molecular portfolio.In Surgical, the business grew nearly 9% organically and more than 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the company saw procedural volume return and acceleration from its new business lines.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMolecular Diagnostics Sees Growth Despite Lower COVID-19 Tests: Hologic’s global molecular diagnostics franchise grew 17% at a constant exchange rate, excluding revenues from COVID-19 tests. This upside reflected the high utilization of the company’s expanded Panther installed base.Strength in GYN Surgical: Over the past two years, the GYN Surgical business has transformed into the most profitable division of Hologic on a percentage basis. It banks on new leadership, the strong strategic execution of new commercial models and new product launches.Story continuesRevenues from the GYN Surgical business rose 9% year over year organically and more than 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the pressure of COVID-19 on the Surgical business abated in the quarter. The major growth drivers of the fiscal fourth quarter were MyoSure Fluent, Bolder and Acessa.DownsidesDull Sales Scenario: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hologic witnessed a decline in reported revenues compared to the year-ago period. The decline in the top line can be attributed to lower COVID-19 assay sales and supply-chain challenges in the Breast Health business.Moreover, revenues in the Breast Health segment fell on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent shortage of semiconductor chips.Foreign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Hologic faced due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact. This has been adversely affecting the company’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been constant at $3.46.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.81 billion, suggesting a 21.6% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV, Orthofix Medical Inc. OFIX and Merit Medical System MMSI.ShockWave Medical, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 33.1% for 2023. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 180.1%.ShockWave Medical has outperformed its industry in the past year. SWAV has rallied 35% against the industry’s 32.6% fall in the past year.Orthofix Medical, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of 13 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a stupendous 550%.

You can see shares popping today on an upgrade from CFRA. Shares up just over 5% now before moving off the sidelines here, upgrading its sell rating to a buy rating and a new price target set at $310. Analyst Ken Leon noticing-- noting that it will be difficult for competitors to catch Netflix, one of the few profitable streaming providers. Leon also highlights Netflix's ad supported tier and the company's further emphasis on limited password sharing that I think we're going to see in 2023.Now, Seana, really, this comes counter to what we've seen from some other commentary when we hear that the ad revenue model was not the most popular option in November. Also, you've heard analysts kind of call for Netflix's shrinking subscriber-- or point out, I should say, Netflix has shrunk its subscribers this year. It's been an interesting year for the stock, right? You see the stock down about over 50% on the year.But it's up 60% in the last six months, as they've started to launch this ad tier. It seems like 2023 is going to be an interesting year for Netflix to sort of see what happens, right? Is this upturn going to continue and people sort of come around to this ad tier, or does it not quite come to fruition?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think it's interesting here in terms of the timing of this call from CFRA because we have gotten those reports that the ad tier hasn't been, I guess, as successful as maybe Netflix had initially been hoping. But it's only been a month, and I think we really need to put that in perspective as well. I haven't seen a lot of marketing for this ad tier. I don't know if it's because they already have Netflix, and they pay for one of the more expensive subscriptions. So maybe they don't exactly want me to downgrade.But the big question with the ad tier going forward is how many new subscribers they are going to be able to attract to that program, and also if they're going to be able to keep many of the subscribers that they currently have paying for the more expensive tiers. I think that's going to be critical that we don't see a huge chunk of subscribers trading down, although some analysts aren't necessarily too concerned about that.Story continuesI also thought it was interesting in Ken's note here, he talked about that he doesn't think Netflix needs a major sports event or sponsor. And that carries a risk of being a, quote, ""big loss leader."" So we talked about Netflix not really getting into sports when so many of its competitors are doing so. I don't know. Maybe it's a smart move for Netflix.JOSH SCHAFER: One way for Netflix to save money, right?SEANA SMITH: It is. 'Cause you know--JOSH SCHAFER: They're not spending the billions of dollars.SEANA SMITH: --billions and billions of dollars certainly not a cheap thing to go after.]"

The report states that scammers target states with densely populated cities in order to reach as many people as possible.However, even if you don’t live in one of those states, it’s important to stay vigilant and never click on a link (or otherwise engage) when you are unsure whether a text you receive is legitimate. Instead, directly contact the company, service or person the text is allegedly from to verify its legitimacy.Here are five new text message scams that will take your money.Amazon Text Message ScamAs part of this scam, you’ll receive a text message stating it’s from Amazon. It also will state that there is a problem with your Amazon account and prompt you to verify your personal information by clicking the provided link. Of course, the link is not from Amazon and any personal information you provide will be delivered to a scammer.Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?Netflix Text Message ScamOne of the most recent Netflix scams involves texts claiming to be from the popular streaming service to notify you that your payment for your Netflix subscription has failed. The message states that your account is restricted or will be closed due to nonpayment. If you happen to fall for it and click on the provided link, you’ll be taken to a fake page where you’ll be prompted to enter your login information or your credit card details for scammers to take advantage of.Story continuesPayPal Text Message ScamDuring a PayPal scam, scammers send text messages claiming to be from PayPal to alert you that there is an issue with your account. You will be prompted to either call a phone number or click a link to resolve the issue. Either action will expose you and your personal information to the scammers.Two-Factor Authentication Text Message ScamTwo-factor authentication is a way to keep scammers from hackers from accessing your account even when they have your username and password. So the object of this scam is to get you to give up your authentication code.You’ll receive a text appearing to be from a company or service you do business with that states it has detected suspicious login activity on your account, which will be locked unless you can prove you are the owner.

""It's just that it's fully exposed to all the consumer softening trends, especially in discretionary items, and inflationary pressure. It's going to take time for the Amazon ship to right itself, but it will right itself. I think depending on how long-term your horizon is, if you are willing to look out more than a year, I think Amazon's at a good price point here.""Right now, that is a tall order to ask most investors given how tough Amazon's year has been financially and from a stock price perspective.Shares of the tech giant are now hovering at a fresh 52-week low and are down about 50% year to date, according to Yahoo Finance data. The stock is off by 13% in December alone.That performance rivals the dreadful performances from Amazon's counterparts in the closely followed FAANG (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex, with Meta enduring a 64% drop and Netflix plunging 51% year to date.As for its fundamentals, Amazon announced on Oct. 27 it missed third-quarter analyst estimates as top-line growth continued to cool and costs remained elevated. For the fourth quarter, Amazon guided that revenue would come in between $140 billion and $144 billion instead of the $155 billion then projected by analysts.Amazon shares were hammered by nearly 10% the following day.An Amazon delivery worker pulls a delivery cart full of packages during its annual Prime Day promotion in New York City, U.S., June 21, 2021.

It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierThe screener yields winning stocks like W.W. Grainger GWW, Olympic Steel ZEUS, Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, Group 1 Automotive GPI and Phillips 66 PSX.Why Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 10 stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

With the upgrades, the company expects the Njord field to produce for another 20 years.The Njord field is an important asset in Equinor’s portfolio in Norway. The project brings the company closer to its production target of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.Equinor mentioned that 10 wells would be drilled from an upgraded drilling facility. Discoveries have been made at the outer edges of the Njord field, and additional exploration will be executed in the nearby area.The project will double the field’s lifetime and provide a focus for tie-ins in the area. The project aligns well with the company’s strategy of focusing more on core areas with the potential for extra synergies.According to plans, the Njord field will receive power from shore in a few years through the Draugen platform in the Norwegian Sea and be partially electrified. This will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 130,000 tons per year.The platform and FSO have been designed to receive production from two new subsea fields — Bauge and Fenja — with 110 million barrels of recoverable resources. The return of the Njord field will unlock the potential for exploration in the nearby area.Price PerformanceShares of Equinor have underperformed the industry in the past three months.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned -8.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.62 points to a change of +3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.44 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.23 billion and $28.51 billion estimates indicate +1% and +8.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. EPS of $4.70 for the same period compares with $4.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.32%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here are the five simple measures you can take to save energy this month and all year long.1. Install LEDs. Replace incandescent bulbs in your home with high-efficiency LEDs. LEDs use 80% less energy than conventional bulbs and last much longer. Remember to turn off lights whenever you're the last one to leave a room.2. Adjust the thermostat to save energy at night or when no one's at home. If you have a programmable thermostat and you're not using it, now's a great time to start. Smart thermostat models include advanced features, such as remote control.3. Pull the plug on standby power. Many electronic devices continue to use power when they're turned off. Unplug chargers and other electronic devices when it's convenient. Advanced power strips and smart plugs automatically shut off power to plugged-in devices when they're not being used.4. Go low flow. The typical shower sends more than 25 gallons of hot water down the drain. Save water and energy by installing low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators. Also, take shorter showers and reduce the temperature on your water heater to 120°F.5. Run full loads. Your dishwasher and clothes washer use a lot of water and energy. Make the most of it by waiting until you have a full load to operate them. Air dry clothes when you can. It reduces energy use for drying and is easier on fabric, making your clothes last longer.Energy conservation is a year-round commitment. Little things, such as taking the time to turn things off when you're not using them, can make a big difference.Learn more about PSE&amp;G hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)Website: http://www.pseg.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733581/Its-Always-a-Good-Time-To-Save]"
115,a15a7269-f263-3f6e-8f6d-ba66e94d238b,M,2022-12-30,The biggest questions in Olympic sports for 2023,NBC Sports,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a15a7269-f263-3f6e-8f6d-ba66e94d238b/the-biggest-questions-in.html,1672401616,STORY,['M'],"[Simone Biles, Suni LeeBurning questions in Olympic sports for 2023, when athletes start qualifying for the 2024 Paris Games …How many Olympic all-around gold medalists will return? Suni Lee competed strictly in NCAA gymnastics since winning the Tokyo Olympic all-around, but she announced last month that this sophomore season will be her last for the Auburn Tigers. Lee plans to return to elite, Olympic-level gymnastics after this winter. She hasn’t announced her comeback meet, but she has plenty of time ahead of the most significant domestic competitions in August.Meanwhile, Simone Biles said in September that she plans to be at the Paris Olympics. She just has to decide whether that will be as an athlete or a spectator. Biles hasn’t provided further updates since but, as of the third quarter of this year, was still getting drug tested. That’s significant because if Biles does not withdraw her name from the testing pool, she is excused from the six-month waiting period to return to competition for athletes who leave and then re-enter the testing pool.Then there’s 2012 Olympic all-around champ Gabby Douglas. She last competed at the 2016 Rio Games, but reports — and a photo — from this fall indicated she has been training at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Texas, which produced Olympic all-around champions Carly Patterson and Nastia Liukin and reigning U.S. all-around champion Konnor McClain. Douglas hasn’t commented publicly, and her representative said Wednesday there is nothing new to report.What will Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone race? For the first time, McLaughlin-Levrone has a bye into the world championships as a reigning gold medalist. That means she can race the 400m hurdles at August’s worlds in Budapest without entering the event at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in July. Athletes with byes sometimes compete in other events at nationals. Mix that with her comments from this fall that she wants to add the flat 400m to her program — but not give up the hurdles, yet at least — and we have our burning question.Story continuesWhen McLaughlin-Levrone made those fall comments, no concrete decision had been made about a possible 400m/400m hurdles double bid in 2023 (or 2024). At worlds, the women’s 400m hurdles first round heats start 2 hours and 20 minutes before the women’s 400m semifinals. Top-level pros rarely race multiple times in one session in a distance longer than 200 meters at any meet.The Olympic schedule is accommodating as ever for a possible women’s 400m/400m hurdles double in 2024 (no woman has ever earned a medal in both races at one Olympics or worlds). For the first time in Olympic history, none of the rounds of those races take place on the same day at the Games. But doing both through the finals would still be a challenge: racing six consecutive days at the Olympics (and a seventh day at the end if adding the 4x400m relay).Will Caeleb Dressel compete in 2023, and if so, when? Dressel, who won five golds at the Tokyo Games, withdrew on unspecified medical grounds during June’s world championships after winning his first two finals. He hasn’t competed since and last provided an update on Sept. 4, saying he was happy, had not swum since worlds and missed swimming. He ended the social media post with the line, “I’ll be back.”The next major meet is the U.S. Championships from June 27-July 1, the qualifying meet for the world championships in Japan later in July. In Dressel’s absence, Olympic 200m fly champion Kristof Milak became the new world champion in the 100m fly, where Dressel holds the world record. In the 100m freestyle, where Dressel had been the world’s fastest man outside of the super-suit era, 18-year-old Romanian David Popovici won the world title and then broke the world record.Is Katie Ledecky headed for a Race of the Century? Swimming worlds may also produce the most anticipated head-to-head-to-head race in 18 years. The women’s 400m freestyle could pit Ledecky (reigning world champion) against Australian Ariarne Titmus (reigning Olympic champion) and 16-year-old Canadian phenom Summer McIntosh. This year, Titmus broke Ledecky’s world record but skipped a showdown with Ledecky at the world championships in prioritizing the Commonwealth Games. McIntosh took silver to Ledecky at worlds, becoming the fourth-fastest woman in history.The hype has been compared to the “Race of the Century,” when Michael Phelps, Aussie Ian Thorpe and Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband met in the 200m free at the 2004 Athens Games (won by Thorpe).Will Mikaela Shiffrin break one of Alpine skiing’s historic records? Shiffrin heads into 2023 in arguably her best form since her incredible 2018-19 season, winning her last four races across three different disciplines to reach 80 World Cup wins. She is two victories shy of Lindsey Vonn‘s female record and six away from Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark‘s overall record that has stood since he retired in 1989. Shiffrin getting to 87 would be the most significant accomplishment in American ski racing — outside of the Olympics — since her breakout world title at age 17 in 2013.Shiffrin is 27 years old and expects to compete at least through the 2026 Winter Games. If she gets to 87 World Cup wins in 2023, having averaged about eight victories per season, you have to start wondering whether 100 is possible.What happens with Russian athletes? Russians and Belarusians in most Olympic sports have been banned from international competition since the invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago. Olympic sports leaders have discussed since at least September how athletes who do not endorse the war could return in the future. The International Olympic Committee is not yet recommending the lifting of the bans, but did say it planned to explore the possibility of Russian athletes taking part in Olympic qualifying competitions in Asia rather than Europe.A key sport is gymnastics. Russian gymnasts won men’s and women’s team gold at the Tokyo Games. As rules currently stand, Russians must compete at their continental championships this year (April for Europe, May or June for Asia) to remain eligible to qualify full teams for the Paris Games.Will any U.S. beach volleyball gold medalist return? The Olympic beach volleyball qualifying window runs from January 2023 into June 2024. It looks likely to start with no public word from reigning gold medalists Alix Klineman and April Ross on whether either will bid for the Paris Games. Klineman, 32, hasn’t competed since shoulder surgery last January. Ross, 40, last competed in March, then withdrew before June’s world championships, where she was entered with Emily Day, with an unspecified injury.“I’m weighing a lot of factors, a lot of life factors, a lot of, you know, opportunity factors,” Ross said earlier this month. “There’s a lot of things that are appealing to me at the moment, and I just have to decide which direction I want to go. But yeah, I still feel like I have a lot of good years of volleyball left in me.”Kerri Walsh Jennings, the most decorated Olympic beach volleyball player with four medals (three gold), has been working out on Hermosa Beach with 2000 Olympic indoor teammate Logan Tom, according to videos posted by Buzzle this month. Walsh Jennings, 44, last played a tournament in June 2021, when she and then-partner Brooke Sweat were eclipsed for the second and last U.S. spot for the Tokyo Games. Walsh Jennings said last spring that she wanted Tom to be her new partner, then said in October that she should have an answer on her 2024 Olympic bid plans after the start of the new year.The gold medalists have some time to deliberate, but probably need to return at some point in 2023 or risk falling significantly behind in qualifying for two Olympic spots. The U.S. has two strong, younger pairs in Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, who won the most recent top-level international event earlier this month, and Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, who won five times between the domestic AVP and international FIVB tours in 2022.Will Stephen Curry join Steve Kerr at the 2023 FIBA World Cup? (Getty)Which NBA superstars will suit up for USA Basketball? The U.S. men’s basketball team may face a gigantic threat at the Paris Games (more on that in the next burning question), but first comes the quadrennial FIBA World Cup in August and September. Recall four years ago that the Americans, with just two reigning NBA All-Stars on the team and one player with Olympic experience, lost twice at the World Cup en route to their worst major tournament result ever — seventh place.After Gregg Popovich coached the team to a bounce-back gold in Tokyo, Steve Kerr succeeded him as head coach. Grant Hill followed Jerry Colangelo as national team managing director. Will America’s best players sign up to travel around the globe — the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia co-host worlds — a month before NBA preseason training camps?Which country will Joel Embiid play for? The Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center, who was born in Cameroon, gained French nationality and U.S. citizenship this year, potentially making him eligible to represent any of those nations in international basketball. Embiid has not yet announced his choice, if he decides to play at all, but France’s GM expressed confidence last month.If Embiid joins France, it could give the Olympic host country triplet towers with fellow 7-footers Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, an 18-year-old whom LeBron James described as a one-of-a-kind talent. That could pose problems for the U.S. Anthony Davis, who skipped the Tokyo Olympics, is the lone U.S. center to make an All-NBA first, second or third team in the last five seasons.Can Kelly Slater qualify for Olympic surfing at age 51? Many thought surfing’s debut in Tokyo was Slater’s only shot at the Olympics. He missed the team by one spot when it came down to the last event of yearlong qualifying. Then Slater came back in February to win the most prestigious contest in the sport — the Pipeline Masters — 30 years after he won it for the first time. Slater didn’t make the quarterfinals of any other event and finished the 2022 season ranked fifth among American men in world standings.The top two American men in next year’s standings likely qualify for the Olympics. In a change from Tokyo, the U.S. has the chance to earn a third Olympic men’s spot if it wins the 2024 World Surfing Games. That spot can be filled via discretionary pick.Will the 2030 Winter Olympic and Paralympic host be decided? The IOC announced earlier this month that the 2030 host is no longer expected to be decided before next fall, citing wider discussions into the future of the Winter Games, including the effects of climate change and the possibility of rotating the Games within a pool of hosts.Previously, Salt Lake City, Sapporo, Japan, and Vancouver were confirmed as bids. Then in October, the British Columbia government said it would not support a Vancouver bid, a major setback, though organizers did not say that decision ended the bid. Then last week, Japanese officials announced a pause in the active promotion of the Sapporo bid that may include a national survey asking the public whether it wants to host the Games.U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee officials have said Salt Lake City is a likelier candidate for 2034 than 2030 — with Los Angeles already hosting the 2028 Summer Games — but could step in for 2030 if asked.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

Global crude topped $139 a barrel in March then cooled as central bank rate hikes threatened to tip economies into recession. Oil settled at $85.91 per barrel on Friday, up 10% on the year.In Europe, the benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract ended about 8% higher, down from the record highs seen earlier in the year as Europe successfully built up gas stocks.Story continuesU.S. gas futures jumped by more than 20% and Dutch wholesale gas prices rose by almost 8%, both up for a third consecutive year.Graphic: Energy futures 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/egvbyygqlpq/Pasted%20image%201672300742485.pngBecause Europe will continue to import LNG to rebuild gas inventories next year after winter, gas prices are expected to remain elevated as limited new supplies come onstream.The dismantling of tight pandemic controls in China, the world's second-largest LNG importer, could also promote economic recovery and greater LNG consumption next year.However, a European cap on gas prices starting in February could keep a lid on the market and reduce the volatility seen this year.In industrial metals, copper on the London Metal Exchange is on track to fall 13% this year and aluminium is down about 15%. Both reached record highs in March.Graphic: Metals performance 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdkkbajvo/Pasted%20image%201672300176258.pngSpot prices of iron ore bound for China, which consumes about two-thirds of global supply, have fallen about 4% this year, ending near $118 per tonne.Citi analysts are bearish on nickel and zinc for the next six to 12 months, seeing strong supply growth, and bullish on iron ore and aluminium.""Iron ore is expected to remain strong in the near term and could follow through in the bull case of a major China credit easing,"" they said in a note.China's U-turn on COVID policy and its pledge to increase support for the real estate sector helped to support ferrous and non-ferrous metals in December.Still, optimism has been tempered by the country's surging COVID infections and risks of global recession in 2023 if central banks, as expected, keep hiking rates.Nickel, the outperformer in metals, is on course for a 45% rise, its largest since 2010, partly because of a shortage of metal that can be delivered against the LME contract and partly because of volatility created by low volumes and liquidity after a trading fiasco in March.RISING FOOD PRICESBenchmark Chicago wheat futures jumped to an all-time high of $13.63-1/2 a bushel in March on supply disruptions. Fewer grain exports from Ukraine further pressured a market already higher on adverse weather and COVID-19 related restrictions. Wheat ended the year up about 3%, however, after a tentative renewal of some Ukrainian exports.Corn and soybeans hit a decade high, while Malaysia's benchmark crude palm oil prices climbed to an all-time record. Soybeans and corn both ended the year up around 14%, as severe drought in Argentina raised concerns about South America's crop.Graphic: Grains, edible oil prices - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdvzqqgjrpw/Pasted%20image%201672304115449.pngGoing forward, food-commodity prices are likely to stay elevated. Wheat production is unlikely to replenish depleted world inventories, at least in the first half of 2023, while crops producing edible oils are suffering from adverse weather in Latin America and Southeast Asia.""U.S. winter wheat is facing harsh cold weather and, even if the crop improves, we will have those supplies (only) in the second half of 2023,"" said a Singapore-based trader at an international trading company.The rice market, which sat out the rally in grain prices in the first half of the year, got a boost after India, the world's biggest exporter, decided in September to curb supplies. India's 5% broken parboiled rice is up almost 6% in 2022 and Vietnam's 5% broken rice has gained more than 15%.Among precious metals, gold has lost around 1% in 2022, down for a second year, silver is up almost 3%, platinum has gained 11% and palladium is down 5%.As worries over recession cloud consumer demand, coffee is among the biggest commodities losers of the year. Robusta fell 24% in 2022 and arabica lost more than a quarter of its value, also impacted by expectations of a bumper crop in top grower Brazil.Tokyo rubber has lost more than 8% while raw sugar was up more than 6%. ICE cotton has dropped more than 26% in 2022 on softening demand.(Reporting by Naveen Thukral and Florence Tan; Additional reporting by Emily Chow, Enrico Dela Cruz and Pratima Desai; Editing by Caroline Stauffer, Barbara Lewis and Matthew Lewis)]"

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Remains Defiant at the Close of a Dreadful YearBy James RubinOn the third to last day of a historically, massively, tragically bad year, bitcoin held its head proudly if barely above water.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just above $16,630, up a few fractions of a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""Story continuesEther was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively. The S&amp;P notched its biggest gains in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1%. Investors remain wary about China's retreat from Covid lockdown, which could jolt its stagnant economic growth but also raise global, energy prices.Security remains a key issue for the crypto industry. In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses. The former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.According to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi)Earlier in the program, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andrew Baehr, said that although bitcoin's value declined about 64% year-to-date, CoinDesk research showed that BTC and ETH returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.““We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,"" Baehr said. ""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.9%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.8%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+2.6%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−2.9%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−2.8%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.1%Smart Contract PlatformInsightsFund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023By James RubinA year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.What's in store in 2023?In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market. We don't conrol our own destiny on price and adoption.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.5%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.5%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+1.9%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.1%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−3.0%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.5%Smart Contract PlatformImportant events.2:45 p.m. HKT/SGT(6:45 a.m. UTC): Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (Dec.)6 p.m. HKT/SGT(10 a.m. UTC): Baker Hughes U.S. Oil Rig Count CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Alameda Research Liquidates Ether-Based Holdings for Bitcoin; A Silver Lining in BTC and ETH Performance""First Mover"" dives into the day's top stories, including the sudden sale of several tokens held by Alameda Research worth some $1.7 million.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) stock is up an impressive 102% over the last five years. In the last week the share price is up 1.6%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Zoetis To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Zoetis' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Zoetis's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 108% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Zoetis shareholders did even worse, losing 39% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 16% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Zoetis better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

With a market capitalization of $14.7 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 5.5 million. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Several buyouts and alliances, a well-performing CareCredit platform, and a strong financial position continue to drive Synchrony.The leading U.S. consumer financial services provider, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, has a solid record of beating estimates in each of the trailing seven quarters.Can SYF Retain the Momentum?Synchrony remains on a spree to undertake numerous growth-related initiatives, ranging from acquisitions and partnerships to the renewal of alliances with well-established retailers and manufacturers. These efforts, in turn, are expected to diversify its product suite and solidify its nationwide foothold.Some of the notable growth efforts undertaken by SYF in the fourth quarter of 2022 so far include partnering with Dutch to offer an upgraded pet insurance plan and expanding its tie-up with Belk to provide customers greater purchasing flexibility.This year, a rebounding economy, resulting in improved consumer spending, is expected to lead to broad-based purchase volume growth for SYF across several industries and the markets it caters to.Synchrony boasts a solid digital arm that has been developed through partnerships with tech giants and significant investments. Advanced digital capabilities empower SYF to ease financing at the point of sale and offer seamless shopping experiences to customers.The company keeps an eye to expand its CareCredit platform for which it resorted to acquiring Pets Best Insurance, and partnering with Medofficedirect and Thrive Pet Healthcare.A strong financial position, substantiated by growing cash reserves, enables Synchrony to service short-term debt obligations. The financial strength also equips SYF to prudently deploy capital via share buybacks and dividend payments. Its return on equity stands at 25.6% as of Sep 30, 2022, ahead of the industry average of 19.9%.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Mastercard has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Mastercard peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Mastercard will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Mastercard's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 23% last year. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 51% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.1% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Mastercard's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Mastercard's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that Mastercard maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Mastercard that you need to be mindful of.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

127,a15a7269-f263-3f6e-8f6d-ba66e94d238b,MA,2022-12-30,The biggest questions in Olympic sports for 2023,NBC Sports,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a15a7269-f263-3f6e-8f6d-ba66e94d238b/the-biggest-questions-in.html,1672401616,STORY,"['GC=F', 'SI=F']","[Simone Biles, Suni LeeBurning questions in Olympic sports for 2023, when athletes start qualifying for the 2024 Paris Games …How many Olympic all-around gold medalists will return? Suni Lee competed strictly in NCAA gymnastics since winning the Tokyo Olympic all-around, but she announced last month that this sophomore season will be her last for the Auburn Tigers. Lee plans to return to elite, Olympic-level gymnastics after this winter. She hasn’t announced her comeback meet, but she has plenty of time ahead of the most significant domestic competitions in August.Meanwhile, Simone Biles said in September that she plans to be at the Paris Olympics. She just has to decide whether that will be as an athlete or a spectator. Biles hasn’t provided further updates since but, as of the third quarter of this year, was still getting drug tested. That’s significant because if Biles does not withdraw her name from the testing pool, she is excused from the six-month waiting period to return to competition for athletes who leave and then re-enter the testing pool.Then there’s 2012 Olympic all-around champ Gabby Douglas. She last competed at the 2016 Rio Games, but reports — and a photo — from this fall indicated she has been training at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Texas, which produced Olympic all-around champions Carly Patterson and Nastia Liukin and reigning U.S. all-around champion Konnor McClain. Douglas hasn’t commented publicly, and her representative said Wednesday there is nothing new to report.What will Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone race? For the first time, McLaughlin-Levrone has a bye into the world championships as a reigning gold medalist. That means she can race the 400m hurdles at August’s worlds in Budapest without entering the event at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in July. Athletes with byes sometimes compete in other events at nationals. Mix that with her comments from this fall that she wants to add the flat 400m to her program — but not give up the hurdles, yet at least — and we have our burning question.Story continuesWhen McLaughlin-Levrone made those fall comments, no concrete decision had been made about a possible 400m/400m hurdles double bid in 2023 (or 2024). At worlds, the women’s 400m hurdles first round heats start 2 hours and 20 minutes before the women’s 400m semifinals. Top-level pros rarely race multiple times in one session in a distance longer than 200 meters at any meet.The Olympic schedule is accommodating as ever for a possible women’s 400m/400m hurdles double in 2024 (no woman has ever earned a medal in both races at one Olympics or worlds). For the first time in Olympic history, none of the rounds of those races take place on the same day at the Games. But doing both through the finals would still be a challenge: racing six consecutive days at the Olympics (and a seventh day at the end if adding the 4x400m relay).Will Caeleb Dressel compete in 2023, and if so, when? Dressel, who won five golds at the Tokyo Games, withdrew on unspecified medical grounds during June’s world championships after winning his first two finals. He hasn’t competed since and last provided an update on Sept. 4, saying he was happy, had not swum since worlds and missed swimming. He ended the social media post with the line, “I’ll be back.”The next major meet is the U.S. Championships from June 27-July 1, the qualifying meet for the world championships in Japan later in July. In Dressel’s absence, Olympic 200m fly champion Kristof Milak became the new world champion in the 100m fly, where Dressel holds the world record. In the 100m freestyle, where Dressel had been the world’s fastest man outside of the super-suit era, 18-year-old Romanian David Popovici won the world title and then broke the world record.Is Katie Ledecky headed for a Race of the Century? Swimming worlds may also produce the most anticipated head-to-head-to-head race in 18 years. The women’s 400m freestyle could pit Ledecky (reigning world champion) against Australian Ariarne Titmus (reigning Olympic champion) and 16-year-old Canadian phenom Summer McIntosh. This year, Titmus broke Ledecky’s world record but skipped a showdown with Ledecky at the world championships in prioritizing the Commonwealth Games. McIntosh took silver to Ledecky at worlds, becoming the fourth-fastest woman in history.The hype has been compared to the “Race of the Century,” when Michael Phelps, Aussie Ian Thorpe and Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband met in the 200m free at the 2004 Athens Games (won by Thorpe).Will Mikaela Shiffrin break one of Alpine skiing’s historic records? Shiffrin heads into 2023 in arguably her best form since her incredible 2018-19 season, winning her last four races across three different disciplines to reach 80 World Cup wins. She is two victories shy of Lindsey Vonn‘s female record and six away from Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark‘s overall record that has stood since he retired in 1989. Shiffrin getting to 87 would be the most significant accomplishment in American ski racing — outside of the Olympics — since her breakout world title at age 17 in 2013.Shiffrin is 27 years old and expects to compete at least through the 2026 Winter Games. If she gets to 87 World Cup wins in 2023, having averaged about eight victories per season, you have to start wondering whether 100 is possible.What happens with Russian athletes? Russians and Belarusians in most Olympic sports have been banned from international competition since the invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago. Olympic sports leaders have discussed since at least September how athletes who do not endorse the war could return in the future. The International Olympic Committee is not yet recommending the lifting of the bans, but did say it planned to explore the possibility of Russian athletes taking part in Olympic qualifying competitions in Asia rather than Europe.A key sport is gymnastics. Russian gymnasts won men’s and women’s team gold at the Tokyo Games. As rules currently stand, Russians must compete at their continental championships this year (April for Europe, May or June for Asia) to remain eligible to qualify full teams for the Paris Games.Will any U.S. beach volleyball gold medalist return? The Olympic beach volleyball qualifying window runs from January 2023 into June 2024. It looks likely to start with no public word from reigning gold medalists Alix Klineman and April Ross on whether either will bid for the Paris Games. Klineman, 32, hasn’t competed since shoulder surgery last January. Ross, 40, last competed in March, then withdrew before June’s world championships, where she was entered with Emily Day, with an unspecified injury.“I’m weighing a lot of factors, a lot of life factors, a lot of, you know, opportunity factors,” Ross said earlier this month. “There’s a lot of things that are appealing to me at the moment, and I just have to decide which direction I want to go. But yeah, I still feel like I have a lot of good years of volleyball left in me.”Kerri Walsh Jennings, the most decorated Olympic beach volleyball player with four medals (three gold), has been working out on Hermosa Beach with 2000 Olympic indoor teammate Logan Tom, according to videos posted by Buzzle this month. Walsh Jennings, 44, last played a tournament in June 2021, when she and then-partner Brooke Sweat were eclipsed for the second and last U.S. spot for the Tokyo Games. Walsh Jennings said last spring that she wanted Tom to be her new partner, then said in October that she should have an answer on her 2024 Olympic bid plans after the start of the new year.The gold medalists have some time to deliberate, but probably need to return at some point in 2023 or risk falling significantly behind in qualifying for two Olympic spots. The U.S. has two strong, younger pairs in Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, who won the most recent top-level international event earlier this month, and Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, who won five times between the domestic AVP and international FIVB tours in 2022.Will Stephen Curry join Steve Kerr at the 2023 FIBA World Cup? (Getty)Which NBA superstars will suit up for USA Basketball? The U.S. men’s basketball team may face a gigantic threat at the Paris Games (more on that in the next burning question), but first comes the quadrennial FIBA World Cup in August and September. Recall four years ago that the Americans, with just two reigning NBA All-Stars on the team and one player with Olympic experience, lost twice at the World Cup en route to their worst major tournament result ever — seventh place.After Gregg Popovich coached the team to a bounce-back gold in Tokyo, Steve Kerr succeeded him as head coach. Grant Hill followed Jerry Colangelo as national team managing director. Will America’s best players sign up to travel around the globe — the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia co-host worlds — a month before NBA preseason training camps?Which country will Joel Embiid play for? The Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center, who was born in Cameroon, gained French nationality and U.S. citizenship this year, potentially making him eligible to represent any of those nations in international basketball. Embiid has not yet announced his choice, if he decides to play at all, but France’s GM expressed confidence last month.If Embiid joins France, it could give the Olympic host country triplet towers with fellow 7-footers Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, an 18-year-old whom LeBron James described as a one-of-a-kind talent. That could pose problems for the U.S. Anthony Davis, who skipped the Tokyo Olympics, is the lone U.S. center to make an All-NBA first, second or third team in the last five seasons.Can Kelly Slater qualify for Olympic surfing at age 51? Many thought surfing’s debut in Tokyo was Slater’s only shot at the Olympics. He missed the team by one spot when it came down to the last event of yearlong qualifying. Then Slater came back in February to win the most prestigious contest in the sport — the Pipeline Masters — 30 years after he won it for the first time. Slater didn’t make the quarterfinals of any other event and finished the 2022 season ranked fifth among American men in world standings.The top two American men in next year’s standings likely qualify for the Olympics. In a change from Tokyo, the U.S. has the chance to earn a third Olympic men’s spot if it wins the 2024 World Surfing Games. That spot can be filled via discretionary pick.Will the 2030 Winter Olympic and Paralympic host be decided? The IOC announced earlier this month that the 2030 host is no longer expected to be decided before next fall, citing wider discussions into the future of the Winter Games, including the effects of climate change and the possibility of rotating the Games within a pool of hosts.Previously, Salt Lake City, Sapporo, Japan, and Vancouver were confirmed as bids. Then in October, the British Columbia government said it would not support a Vancouver bid, a major setback, though organizers did not say that decision ended the bid. Then last week, Japanese officials announced a pause in the active promotion of the Sapporo bid that may include a national survey asking the public whether it wants to host the Games.U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee officials have said Salt Lake City is a likelier candidate for 2034 than 2030 — with Los Angeles already hosting the 2028 Summer Games — but could step in for 2030 if asked.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

Global crude topped $139 a barrel in March then cooled as central bank rate hikes threatened to tip economies into recession. Oil settled at $85.91 per barrel on Friday, up 10% on the year.In Europe, the benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract ended about 8% higher, down from the record highs seen earlier in the year as Europe successfully built up gas stocks.Story continuesU.S. gas futures jumped by more than 20% and Dutch wholesale gas prices rose by almost 8%, both up for a third consecutive year.Graphic: Energy futures 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/egvbyygqlpq/Pasted%20image%201672300742485.pngBecause Europe will continue to import LNG to rebuild gas inventories next year after winter, gas prices are expected to remain elevated as limited new supplies come onstream.The dismantling of tight pandemic controls in China, the world's second-largest LNG importer, could also promote economic recovery and greater LNG consumption next year.However, a European cap on gas prices starting in February could keep a lid on the market and reduce the volatility seen this year.In industrial metals, copper on the London Metal Exchange is on track to fall 13% this year and aluminium is down about 15%. Both reached record highs in March.Graphic: Metals performance 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdkkbajvo/Pasted%20image%201672300176258.pngSpot prices of iron ore bound for China, which consumes about two-thirds of global supply, have fallen about 4% this year, ending near $118 per tonne.Citi analysts are bearish on nickel and zinc for the next six to 12 months, seeing strong supply growth, and bullish on iron ore and aluminium.""Iron ore is expected to remain strong in the near term and could follow through in the bull case of a major China credit easing,"" they said in a note.China's U-turn on COVID policy and its pledge to increase support for the real estate sector helped to support ferrous and non-ferrous metals in December.Still, optimism has been tempered by the country's surging COVID infections and risks of global recession in 2023 if central banks, as expected, keep hiking rates.Nickel, the outperformer in metals, is on course for a 45% rise, its largest since 2010, partly because of a shortage of metal that can be delivered against the LME contract and partly because of volatility created by low volumes and liquidity after a trading fiasco in March.RISING FOOD PRICESBenchmark Chicago wheat futures jumped to an all-time high of $13.63-1/2 a bushel in March on supply disruptions. Fewer grain exports from Ukraine further pressured a market already higher on adverse weather and COVID-19 related restrictions. Wheat ended the year up about 3%, however, after a tentative renewal of some Ukrainian exports.Corn and soybeans hit a decade high, while Malaysia's benchmark crude palm oil prices climbed to an all-time record. Soybeans and corn both ended the year up around 14%, as severe drought in Argentina raised concerns about South America's crop.Graphic: Grains, edible oil prices - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdvzqqgjrpw/Pasted%20image%201672304115449.pngGoing forward, food-commodity prices are likely to stay elevated. Wheat production is unlikely to replenish depleted world inventories, at least in the first half of 2023, while crops producing edible oils are suffering from adverse weather in Latin America and Southeast Asia.""U.S. winter wheat is facing harsh cold weather and, even if the crop improves, we will have those supplies (only) in the second half of 2023,"" said a Singapore-based trader at an international trading company.The rice market, which sat out the rally in grain prices in the first half of the year, got a boost after India, the world's biggest exporter, decided in September to curb supplies. India's 5% broken parboiled rice is up almost 6% in 2022 and Vietnam's 5% broken rice has gained more than 15%.Among precious metals, gold has lost around 1% in 2022, down for a second year, silver is up almost 3%, platinum has gained 11% and palladium is down 5%.As worries over recession cloud consumer demand, coffee is among the biggest commodities losers of the year. Robusta fell 24% in 2022 and arabica lost more than a quarter of its value, also impacted by expectations of a bumper crop in top grower Brazil.Tokyo rubber has lost more than 8% while raw sugar was up more than 6%. ICE cotton has dropped more than 26% in 2022 on softening demand.(Reporting by Naveen Thukral and Florence Tan; Additional reporting by Emily Chow, Enrico Dela Cruz and Pratima Desai; Editing by Caroline Stauffer, Barbara Lewis and Matthew Lewis)]"

BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""Story continuesEther was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively. The S&amp;P notched its biggest gains in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1%. Investors remain wary about China's retreat from Covid lockdown, which could jolt its stagnant economic growth but also raise global, energy prices.Security remains a key issue for the crypto industry. In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses. The former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.According to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi)Earlier in the program, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andrew Baehr, said that although bitcoin's value declined about 64% year-to-date, CoinDesk research showed that BTC and ETH returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.““We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,"" Baehr said. ""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.9%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.8%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+2.6%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−2.9%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−2.8%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.1%Smart Contract PlatformInsightsFund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023By James RubinA year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.What's in store in 2023?In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market. We don't conrol our own destiny on price and adoption.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.5%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.5%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+1.9%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.1%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−3.0%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.5%Smart Contract PlatformImportant events.2:45 p.m. HKT/SGT(6:45 a.m. UTC): Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (Dec.)6 p.m. HKT/SGT(10 a.m. UTC): Baker Hughes U.S. Oil Rig Count CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Alameda Research Liquidates Ether-Based Holdings for Bitcoin; A Silver Lining in BTC and ETH Performance""First Mover"" dives into the day's top stories, including the sudden sale of several tokens held by Alameda Research worth some $1.7 million.

To skip our detailed analysis of wide moat stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Small Cap Stocks With Wide Moats.The beginning of 2022 saw big losses for small-cap stocks, but this soon began to change, as seen by the performance of such stocks as of this July. These stocks have historically been attractive to investors looking to invest early in companies that have a chance of rapidly growing since their market capitalizations are contained within the figures of $300 million to $2 billion. With market caps, this low, small-cap stocks are typically considered to be attractive options for those looking to find a diamond in the rough. Small-cap stocks outperforming the market in July also helped increase the popularity of these stocks among investors. According to a Wall Street Journal article published this July, the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap companies rose by 3.6% that month, while the S&amp;P 500 fell behind with its 3% increase.Larger companies with more recognizable names, like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) have always been investor favorites. However, the performance of small-cap stocks observed above has made these companies also gain in popularity again this year. Investors are now beginning to focus more on small companies with a niche business model that offers them a huge competitive advantage, thus promising long-term growth. Such companies are said to have a wide economic moat.What are wide moat stocks?Companies with attractive pricing and a sustainable competitive advantage are called wide moat companies. A company's moat is rapidly becoming one of the leading metrics in investment strategies to pick those stocks that offer prospective growth because of their command over a particular sector. One index that provides exposures to such companies is the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, comprising companies with Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings of Wide that are trading at the lowest current market price with fair value ratios.Story continuesAccording to a Morningstar Equity Research report, as of 2020, the Wide Moat Focus Index generated an average annual outperformance of 363 basis points versus its benchmark since its 2007 inception date.

(NASDAQ:HCSG) is among the few companies commanding a large part of the market in this sector. The company is one of the largest third-party providers of services like housekeeping and dining, and manages almost all of these services at over 3,000 healthcare facilities across the US. As of this February, Healthcare Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCSG) reported a client retention rate of over 90%. In 2021, the company's net income stood at $45.86 million.Healthcare Services Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:HCSG) in its fourth-quarter 2021 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“For the year, the portfolio’s US stocks failed to keep up with the robust returns of the region in the face of a pronounced style headwind, as US small cap growth stocks trailed their value peers by over 1,400 basis points. Disappointing business results from several US companies also worked against us. Healthcare Services, a provider of outsourced housekeeping and dietary services for post-acute-care and long-term assisted living facilities, saw its rising labor and food costs weigh on both revenues and profits as some of its customers balked at higher fees.”6.

(NYSE:CLB) is an energy company providing reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. The company operates in the US, Canada, and internationally. It is based in Amstelveen, Netherlands.Luke Lemoine at Piper Sandler assumed coverage of Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) shares with a Neutral rating on October 7.The reservoir description business is one that not many companies have waded into just yet, making Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) well-positioned to command a larger percentage of the market there. The company's experience in the US shale, compared to newer competitors, gives it a competitive edge. In the second quarter, Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) saw its revenue grow by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $120.9 million.

These services and products enable Core Laboratories’ clients to improve performance and increase resource recovery from producing fields. Shares underperformed during the quarter even though the company’s production enhancement segment-with its outsized exposure to domestic activity-reported strong results. However, the reservoir description segment-which is more reliant upon international activity (both onshore and offshore)-has recovered more slowly. The company’s global rig count, which has historically been a leading indicator of future reservoir description activity, has improved recently, giving us confidence in the business’s longer-term fundamentals.”Core Laboratories N.V.

(NYSE:WEC) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.78 on the 1st of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, WEC Energy Group's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 18.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 61% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.20 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $3.12. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.We Could See WEC Energy Group's Dividend GrowingInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. WEC Energy Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 7.4% per year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for WEC Energy Group (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President David Calhoun bought US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$189. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.While Boeing insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Boeing Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Boeing. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$4.2m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This makes one think the business has some good points.Does Boeing Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Boeing insiders own about US$64m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Boeing Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchases are heartening. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Boeing we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Boeing you should be aware of.But note: Boeing may not be the best stock to buy.

The typically favorable Christmas-themed month has disappointed investors, as just yesterday a sharp year-end slide witnessed the Nasdaq hit a new closing low for the year. Both domestic and international stocks are on pace for their worst annual drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Declining earnings growth, higher interest rates, and recession jitters have invoked investor fears, putting a damper on prospects for a year-end rally that stocks typically enjoy at the end of December.2022 will undoubtedly go down as one of the more painful years for investors, particularly because the benefits of asset allocation were mainly nonexistent. Along with the negative returns for stocks, bonds suffered their worst year on record as higher rates saw bond prices plummet. And while commodities experienced stellar returns in the first half, many have since come back to down earth. Oil, for example, hit a low for the year earlier this month, briefly falling into negative territory.Still, certain pockets of the market have recently been showing relative strength. While major tech stocks continue to trade near yearly lows and below key technical levels, other areas have displayed immunity to the year-end volatility. Let’s examine three stocks that look to have more upside as we head into the new year.The recent downturn in the U.S. dollar has helped metals rally following a weak start to the year. Over the last three months, silver has rallied more than 26%, while gold has climbed nearly 9% on the heels of the greenback’s weakness.Wheaton Precious Metals sells gold, silver, palladium, and cobalt deposits. WPM boasts a portfolio of interests in 23 operating mines and 13 development projects. Wheaton Precious Metals is one of the largest precious metals streaming companies in the world.Story continuesWPM is part of the Zacks Mining – Miscellaneous industry group, which currently ranks in the top 38% out of approximately 250 industries. This group has widely outperformed the major indices this year with a slightly positive return.WPM has staged a new uptrend and is breaking out as we head into the new year. Simply put, not many stocks are experiencing higher highs and sustained buying pressure. WPM currently pays a $0.60 (1.51%) dividend.Another area that is showing relative strength is aerospace and defense. The iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF hit a 52-week high earlier this month, showing immunity to the recent volatility. ITA provides exposure to domestic companies that manufacture commercial and military aircrafts and other defense equipment. The iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF seeks to track the results of an index composed of equities in the aerospace and defense sector.The ITA ETF is showing sustained buying pressure on increasing volume – a bullish sign.One of the top holdings in the ITA ETF is Boeing. The Boeing Company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, and human space flight services. BA accounts for more than 7% of the ITA ETF holdings.Looking ahead, BA is expected to deliver year-over-year earnings growth of 131.72% to $2.78/share in 2023. Revenues are projected to increase 24.34% to $81.66 billion. It appears BA shares are reflecting this bullish outlook, as the stock has advanced more than 40% over the past three months.Not many stocks are rallying into the year end.

153,a18de46c-8b2c-308e-990f-9610b9debfb9,SO,2022-12-30,The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) insiders sold US$765k worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-nyse-insiders-sold-120029274.html,1672401629,STORY,['SO'],"[Many The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Southern The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SouthernIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, sold US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$72.19). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 29% of Ann Daiss's stake.Southern insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Southern Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Southern shares. In total, Chief Information Officer &amp; Executive VP Martin Davis sold US$201k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Southern Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$165m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Southern Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Southern stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Southern is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 4 warning signs for Southern (1 is a bit concerning!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,608Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Leading investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ranked #15 in terms of S&amp;P 500 components which bought back stock in Q3 2022 with stock repurchases of over $2.6 billion in the quarter.

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,804Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Given the higher oil and gas prices this year as a result of the Russia Ukraine war, analysts expect energy company ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)'s EPS to surge to $14.34 in 2022 from $5.95 in 2021. In terms of future EPS, analysts expect ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to earn $12.87 for 2023 and $10.95 in 2024. Given its strong earnings this year, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) bought back over $2.8 billion worth of its stock in the third quarter.13. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,961Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been a big buyer of its stock in the last decade with a total buyback of $65.59 billion in the last 10 years. Compared to Walmart Inc.

With its buybacks, Wal-Mart's shares outstanding has declined from 3.474 billion in January 2012 to 2.711 billion in October of 2022, down 22% and helping boost EPS and the share price.12.

Given rising interest rates, valuations for dividend stocks have come under pressure as capital has moved from equities into Treasuries. Given the capital outflow and other reasons, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) shares have declined 30.36% year to date despite the buybacks.While shares haven't done well this year, analysts do see Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s EPS rising with consensus earnings per share estimates of $3.59 per share in 2022, $3.75 per share in 2023, and $4.18 per share in 2024.10. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $3,697Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Although it is arguably more known for being a dividend stock given its 35 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is also a considerable buyer of its own stock. For the third quarter, the oil and gas company bought back $3.7 billion worth of its stock, bringing total stock buybacks in the last 10 years to $22.21 billion.Like many other oil and gas companies, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has benefited from higher oil and gas prices this year given the Russia Ukraine war.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Northrop Grumman's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Northrop Grumman is:40% = US$5.5b ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Northrop Grumman's Earnings Growth And 40% ROETo begin with, Northrop Grumman has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 10% which is quite remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Northrop Grumman was able to see a decent net income growth of 17% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Northrop Grumman's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.5%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is NOC worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether NOC is currently mispriced by the market.Is Northrop Grumman Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Northrop Grumman has a low three-year median payout ratio of 21%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 79% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Moreover, Northrop Grumman is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 30% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 26%) over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Northrop Grumman's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study NIKE's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for NIKE How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NIKE is:37% = US$5.6b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.NIKE's Earnings Growth And 37% ROETo begin with, NIKE has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 21% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 18% net income growth seen by NIKE over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NIKE's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is NIKE fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is NIKE Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 34% (implying that the company retains 66% of its profits), it seems that NIKE is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, NIKE has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 33%. Still, forecasts suggest that NIKE's future ROE will rise to 48% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that NIKE's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.

167,3fa30937-8c8b-36f6-9694-7a4db272b03a,WFC,2022-12-30,Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-wfc-trending-140002850.html,1672322402,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[Wells Fargo (WFC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -14.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has lost 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 points to a change of -27.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.06 indicates a change of +40.4% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $19.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.9%. The $74.04 billion and $82.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -5.1% and +11%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $19.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $1.30 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.22%. The EPS surprise was +19.27%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Reported EPS is $0.72 EPS, expectations were $0.72.Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Royalty Pharma Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to George Grofik, SVP, Head of Investor Relations and Communications.

Thank you for joining us to review Royalty Pharma's third quarter 2022 results. You can find the press release with our earnings results and slides for this call on the Investors page of our website at royaltypharma.com. Moving to slide 3. I would like to remind you that information presented in this call contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. I refer you to our 10-K on file with the SEC for a description of these risks. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Royalty Pharma, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand our financial performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release available on our website. And with that, please advance to slide 4. Our speakers on the call today are Pablo Legorreta, Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Marshall Urist, EVP, Head of Research &amp; Investments; and Terry Coyne, EVP, Chief Financial Officer. Pablo will discuss the key highlights after which Marshall will provide a portfolio update and Terry will review the financials. Following concluding remarks from Pablo, we will hold a Q&amp;A session. Chris Hite, our Vice Chairman, will also join the Q&amp;A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pablo.Story continuesPablo Legorreta: Thank you, George. And welcome to everyone on the call. I am delighted to report another quarter of strong execution on our strategy as a leading funder of innovation in life sciences. Slide 6 summarizes our financial and portfolio achievements in the third quarter, which again underscore our strong momentum and the power of our business model. First, we delivered solid financial performance despite significant headwinds from foreign exchange and a one-time benefit from a Soliqua milestone in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted cash received, our top line, grew by 2%; adjusted EBITDA by 3%; and adjusted cash flow, our bottom line, by 26%. Second, we have announced transactions of $3 billion year-to-date, including our innovative R&amp;D funding collaboration with Merck.This is an exciting model for future potential partnerships with large biopharma and Marshall will expand on this later. More broadly, our overall rate of capital deployment reflects the strong demand for innovative royalty-based funding solutions. Third, we saw positive progress across our portfolio. Pfizer closed its acquisition of Biohaven, which has resulted in accelerated value creation to Royalty Pharma. We have a deep development stage portfolio with certain new molecular entities and approximately 40 projects in late stage development  impressive figures, which rival many large biotech companies. Lastly, we're raising our full-year guidance for adjusted cash receipts. Terry will take you through the details later, but we now expect growth of 29% to 32% compared with 7% to 10% at the time of our Q2 results.This increase largely reflects the acceleration of our commercial launch capital payments, resulting from Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven, which has been one of our most successful partnerships since our IPO. In addition, our overall portfolio of royalties continued to perform exceptionally well. I would also remind you that our guidance excludes the potential benefit of any investments that we may make over the remainder of the year. On slide 7, you can see our financials in a little more detail. In the third quarter, we delivered 2% growth in our top line. We estimate that foreign exchange had an approximately 4% negative impact on the quarter. Furthermore, we had a headwind of $37 million relating to one-time milestones on Soliqua in the prior period.Without the impact of these two factors, we would have delivered another quarter of strong double-digit top line operational growth. Consistent with our top line, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 3%. Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP measure for us, which is arrived at by deducting operating and professional expenses from our top line. Lastly, our adjusted cash flow, our bottom line, grew by 26%. This significant increase primarily reflected differences in the size of the orphan development stage payments in the third quarter compared to last year's third quarter. Slide 8 shows our track record of strong top line growth since our IPO in June of 2020. We delivered an impressive 9% growth of adjusted cash receipts year-to-date, despite headwinds which particularly impacted the third quarter, including two of our top royalties ending, HIV and DPP-IV.This speaks to the power of our business model and our ability to continually replenish our portfolio with market-leading therapies through value-enhancing deals. Few of our peers in biopharma could lose two of their top products and still demonstrate such impressive growth. As I mentioned earlier, Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven, which closed in October, accelerated value creation to Royalty Pharma shareholders. On slide 9, from a bigger picture perspective, I wanted to expand on our Biohaven experience and talk more broadly about how we have become a critical funding partner for successful biotechs. When we look across Immunomedics, Biohaven, Cytokinetics, and BioCryst, in all these cases, our partnerships have resulted in Royalty Pharma providing a critical portion of their funding needs, alongside more traditional equity and debt funding.In these instances, our approach was highly customized to each partner's needs. And we used a variety of funding tools, such as royalties, commercial launch capital, and equity purchases. For Royalty Pharma, our investments will generally be validated by the successful development and commercialization of the therapies on which we have royalties. And in certain cases, such as Immunomedics and Biohaven, by the accelerated returns we achieved for our shareholders, resulting from their acquisitions by larger biopharma companies. This biotech funding model, using a variety of sources of capital, includes royalties, has proven to be successful for our partners and we believe should represent the new funding model that the most successful biotechs use in the future.With that, I will hand over to Marshall to update you on our portfolio.Marshall Urist: Thanks, Pablo. Let's move to slide 11. We're delighted to announce our recent R&amp;D funding collaboration with Merck. Revitalizing R&amp;D funding partnerships has been an important initiative at Royalty Pharma, and we think this collaboration structure will serve as a model for future transactions between Royalty Pharma and large biopharma companies. We see plenty of opportunity here. The projected scale of large biopharma R&amp;D spend, $1 trillion cumulatively over the next five years, should create opportunities for Royalty Pharma to fund exciting late stage programs across the industry. The advantages we can offer to large biopharma are clear. We're a true partner for biopharma, able to participate in clinical development, as well as the full trajectory of commercialization around the world.In addition to risk sharing, we can provide capital at scale, allowing the partner to optimize their R&amp;D spend across the broadest opportunity set. In addition, our rigorous diligence process provides independent validation of the opportunity. And as we have consistently demonstrated, we can be flexible and creative in our structure. Lastly, we're long term partners and have built enduring relationships that reflect our unique role in the life sciences funding ecosystem. Slide 12 provides the details of our collaboration with Merck. In summary, Royalty Pharma has agreed to provide up to $425 million to co-fund the clinical development of MK-8189, an oral PDE10A inhibitor in Phase 2b development for schizophrenia. Our excitement about this pipeline therapy comes from our view that MK-8189 has the potential to demonstrate efficacy similar to the standard of care with a differentiated safety profile.The structure of this deal highlights our uniquely flexible approach to alignment with our partners. Our investment can be scaled following program de-risking and Royalty Pharma will make an independent decision to co-fund the Phase 3 program. We agreed to pay $50 million upfront to support the ongoing Phase 2b program. Pending the results of this large randomized controlled study, we have an option to provide $375 million in additional funding if Merck decides to proceed to Phase 3 development. In return for our co-funding, Royalty Pharma will be entitled to a royalty on annual worldwide sales of MK-8189, as well as milestone payment. With US branded schizophrenia sales of around $5.6 billion, this could represent an important royalty stream as we look towards the back half of this decade and beyond.On slide 13, I want to expand on the breadth and depth of our portfolio. We now have the potential to receive royalties on approximately 40 projects in late stage development. The size and diversity of our development stage pipeline, we think, compares well with many of the largest biotech companies. As you can see on our slide, we have considerable therapeutic area diversity in our pipeline, although oncology currently accounts for around half of these projects. We anticipate our pipeline will continue to grow as we invest in both approved and development stage medicines in the years to come. Moving now to slide 14 and the expected clinical and regulatory events for our portfolio over the next year. We have a significant clinical news expected over the remainder of 2022.The recent Phase 3 results for otilimab were disappointing. However, we anticipate Phase 3 readouts for several potentially transformative therapies over the remainder of the year, including results from Cabometyx in combination with immunotherapy and, of course, gantenerumab in Alzheimer's. In 2023, we anticipate readouts from up to seven important Phase 3 programs, including seltorexant for major depressive disorder, Xtandi in non-metastatic prostate cancer, aficamten in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and zavegepant in migraine prevention. On the regulatory front, we expect an FDA decision on PT027 in asthma in the coming months. And in 2023, we anticipate FDA approval decisions on Trodelvy in third line hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer, on intranasal zavegepant in migraine, and on Omecamtiv in heart failure.Many of these milestones present the opportunity to deliver on our mission of accelerating innovation in life science to transform patient lives. With that, I'll hand it over to Terry.See also 12 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology and 15 Most Valuable Sports Companies in the World.Terry Coyne: Thanks, Marshall. Let's move to slide 16. Total royalty receipts were broadly stable in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Growth drivers in the quarter included the cystic fibrosis franchise, Xtandi, Tremfya, and the Trelegy royalty which we acquired in July. We also saw growth contributions from Cabometyx, Promacta, our Biohaven partnership, and though not shown on this slide, from Evrysdi, Trodelvy and Orladeyo. These positive factors were partially offset by the end of the royalty term for the DPP-IV inhibitors, the Soliqua milestone receipt in the prior period, Imbruvica weakness and the unfavorable FX impact. Slide 17 shows how our efficient business model generates substantial cash flow to be redeployed.As you're aware, adjusted cash receipts is a key non-GAAP metric for us which we arrived at after deducting distributions to non-controlling interest. This amounted to $597 million in the quarter, growth of 2%, compared with last year's third quarter. Without the impact of the Soliqua milestone payment, growth would have been 9%, while growth would have been low-double digits if we adjust for the estimated foreign exchange impact. As we moved down the column, operating professional costs were approximately 8% of adjusted cash receipts. On a year-over-year basis, operating professional costs declined by 9%. As a consequence, we reported 3% growth in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, consistent with the growth in our top line. As Pablo noted, adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP financial measure for us and one of the three key non-GAAP metrics by which we measure our business performance.When we think of the cash generated by the business to then be redeployed into new value enhancing royalties, we look to adjusted EBITDA less net interest paid. Net interest paid in the quarter of $75 million reflected the semi-annual timing of the payments on our $7.3 billion of unsecured notes, which occurs in the first and third quarters, and offset by the interest received on our cash, which has been approximately $11 million year-to-date. After the $25 million upfront payment for development stage funding of ampreloxetine and other items, we generated adjusted cash flow, our bottom line, of $441 million or $0.73 per share for the third quarter. This resulted in an adjusted cash flow margin of 74% which once again highlights the efficiency of our business model.Let's now move to slide 18 and our financial position. We continue to maintain significant financial firepower for future royalty acquisitions. Year-to-date, we generated adjusted EBITDA less net interest paid of $1.42 billion. Again, this is the cash the business generates to reinvest or return to shareholders. We have deployed $2.1 billion of capital on royalty acquisitions as well as $362 million on dividends and distribution, bringing our cash and marketable securities to $1.1 billion at the end of September. Shortly after the quarter-end, we received $508 million in net cash related to Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven, which would bring our pro forma cash and marketable securities to $1.64 billion. Excluding this pro forma balance sheet adjustment, our leverage stands at 2.8 times net debt to EBITDA and 3.4 times total debt to EBITDA.As a reminder, the fixed rate average coupon on our debt is slightly above 2%, which compares with our target returns on royalty acquisition in the high-single digit to teens percentage range. I would also note that around 60% of our debt matures in 2030 or beyond. Given our financial strength and efficient business model, we feel we're well positioned to execute on our business plan and create value for shareholders. On slide 19, we are raising our full-year 2022 financial guidance. We now expect adjusted cash receipts to be in the range of $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, an increase of between 29% and 32% over the $2.1 billion we delivered in 2021. This substantial raise in guidance largely reflects the accelerated Biohaven payment of $458 million we received in October.The other payments underlying our top line guidance are essentially unchanged from those we described at the end of our Q2 earnings. And consistent with our standard practice, this guidance is based on our portfolio as of today and does not take into account any future royalty acquisitions. Turning to our operating costs, we expect payments for operating and professional costs to be approximately 8% to 8.5% of adjusted cash receipts in 2022, which is lower versus our guidance from August. Our operating cost guidance reflects both the higher expected adjusted cash receipts and our relatively low fixed cost base. The degree of margin protection provided by our unique business model is, we think, especially impressive in today's inflationary environment.Finally, interest paid for full-year 2022 is still expected to be around $170 million, unchanged from our prior expectation. On slide 20, I want to drill down further on our adjusted cash receipts guidance. The graphic is illustrative and provides the various pushes and pulls behind our raise top line outlook for 2022. Starting with the left hand side, we continue to expect strong performance from our diversified royalty portfolio and the addition of Trelegy royalties in the second half further enhances this growth. The end of our HIV and DPP-IV royalty streams and Imbruvica performance are expected to partially offset the strong growth in our portfolio. As I have noted, the continued strength of the US dollar against key currencies is expected to adversely impact growth by around 3% to 4%, or around $65 million to $85 million for full-year 2022 compared to full-year 2021.As a reminder, we estimate that approximately 40% of our adjusted cash receipts are exposed to regions outside the United States, with the euro representing the most significant portion of our ex-US exposure. If you exclude the Biohaven payments, we are tightening the range relative to our previous guidance, maintaining the higher end and increasing the low end. To deliver high-single digit to low-double digit top line growth is, we think, a tremendous achievement with the loss of two of our prior top royalty streams, as well as significant FX headwinds. We believe this speaks to the strength of our unique business model and our diversified royalty portfolio. And on the right hand side, we can see after layering in the accelerated Biohaven payments, we're guiding to full-year top line growth of between 29% and 32%.To close, I want to highlight a few factors on 2023 to help with your modeling. First, foreign exchange is expected to adversely impact growth by approximately 3% to 4% for full-year 2023 compared to 2022, assuming today's rates remain constant next year. And second, while we are optimistic heading into Pfizer's PFUFA for intranasal zavegepant in the first quarter of 2023, which would result in an accelerated $475 million payment to Royalty Pharma if approved, we do not plan to include that milestone in our 2023 guidance before approval. We plan to provide full-year 2023 guidance when we report fourth quarter 2022 earnings early next year. Consistent with our standard practice, this guidance will exclude contributions from any future investments.With that, I would like to hand the call back to Pablo for his closing comments.Pablo Legorreta: Thanks, Terry. So another strong quarter of strong business momentum, and we're on track to deliver excellent results in 2022. My final slide shows that we're executing well against the updated capital deployment plan we set out in May. So far this year, we have brought many important new medicines into our portfolio, ranging from development stage therapies to unapproved category leading blockbuster with significant remaining growth potential and including some of the highest caliber marketers in the industry. The $3 billion announced value of these transactions puts us well on track to achieving our five-year capital deployment target of $10 billion to $12 billion, and to deliver the attractive compounding growth profile that we described in detail at our Investor Day.Lastly, while our development stage pipeline has grown very nicely over the past couple of years, around two-thirds of the capital we deployed this year has been for approved therapies, given the size of the Trelegy deal. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.George Grofik: We'll now open up the call to your questions.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The US and the global economy are dealing with high inflation, causing the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world to raise benchmark interest rates. Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since February 2022 and COVID-related updates from China have also played a significant role in increasing global uncertainty and escalating recession-related concerns. All these adverse developments have resulted in the leading market indices like the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index posting a year-to-date (YTD) decline of 19.3%, 8.6%, and 32.9%, respectively.Under such circumstances, the famous phrase “cash is king” comes into play often. This means that during uncertain macroeconomic times, cash becomes more valuable than any other form of investment as it provides strength to the balance sheet and acts as a safety net. Popular companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are considered among the best cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds. These companies have also used their cash balances strategically to acquire assets at attractive prices, which has helped these corporations combat the market downturn more aggressively.10 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have shortlisted stocks with strong cash reserves as of Q3 2022 and have ranked them according to the hedge fund sentiment. Experts believe these companies are in a stable position to weather the economic downturn and support their growth plans in the coming quarters.

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $16.19 billionGeneral Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a Boston, Massachusetts-based industrial conglomerate.The company intends to spin off its healthcare division as a separate publicly listed entity in the first week of 2023. However, it must be noted that the cash balance would not be impacted significantly as a cash balance of $500 million has been allocated to the healthcare division as of September 30. Furthermore, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) will also hold a 19.9% stake in the newly spun-off entity.Not only numerous hedge funds are invested in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), but analysts are also bullish on the stock. Julian Mitchell at Barclays assigned General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock a target price of $96 along with an Overweight rating on December 16. The analyst updated his financial estimates to incorporate the impact of spinning off the healthcare business. Experts also believe that the industrial giants are finding pricing support, an improvement in costs, and ease in the supply chain that would be favorable for the bottom line.9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $26.21 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Detroit, Michigan-based automaker that is focused on becoming a leader in the field of electric vehicles (EV).During Investor Day in November, the company shared its electrification plan with analysts and investors. Dan Ives at Wedbush was impressed by the presentation and thinks that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has taken a bullish stance on the overall demand for EVs and its battery production targets. The management looks very confident in achieving those targets, and the significant cash reserve can play an integral part. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) anticipates its top line to compound annually by 12% between the 2023 - 2025 period to reach the $225 billion milestone.The EV segment is expected to contribute $50 billion to the top line by 2025. In August 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) restored its quarterly dividend after suspending it at the start of the pandemic and also increased its share buyback plan from $3.3 billion to $5 billion.Here's what Chartwell Investment Partners said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes General Motors (NYSE:GM, 2.4%), down 27.4%. GM posted solid first-quarter earnings, but, supply issues continue to be a headwind and the market appears to be “pricing-in” at least a mild recession. The question seems to be: by the time the supply constraints are resolved, will we be in a much-worse economic scenario that will “hit” the demand side?After a couple quarters of higher-than-average trading, Q2 was extremely light in both the Growth &amp; Balanced and Dividend Equity accounts (see below). After trimming GM earlier in the year at much higher price levels, we added back to the position. Now trading at $32 per share, GM’s P/E multiple on 2022 earnings estimates is below 5 times its annual earnings per share, which we think is very attractive and is already pricing-in at least a mild recession.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $36.13 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical company.Experts believe Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has built up its cash position due to the tailwinds from the COVID-19 vaccine. The company is now using the cash balance intelligently to acquire companies that integrate with its operations to create synergies and also expand its offerings. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of New Haven, Connecticut-based Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for a sum of $11.6 billion in May 2022. Following that, the company announced the takeover of San Francisco, California-based Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) for $5.4 billion.On December 13, Chris Shibutani at Goldman Sachs upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and increased the target price from $47 to $60. The analyst highlighted the positive pipeline of products that are expected to outperform estimates following their commercial launch in 2023. This can drive significant value to the base business of the company. These developments have also reduced Pfizer Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) reliance on the prolonged outperformance of COVID-19 vaccines.Here's what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7.

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Retirement investing approaches of the past don't work today.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.57 per share, with a dividend yield of 3%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.7%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 10.2%. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.41 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.15% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.47% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.34 per share, Republic Bancorp (RBCAA) has a dividend yield of 3.38%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.08% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 10.71%. Check Republic Bancorp (RBCAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to the Valneva Reports Nine-Month 2022 Results and Provides Corporate Updates Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Thomas Lingelbach, CEO. Please go ahead.Thomas Lingelbach: Thank you. Very good day, everyone. Pleasure to welcome you to our nine-month result and update call. Yes, the nine months have again been marked with quite a potential number of key achievements. We stands today at the nine-month revenue level of about €250 million at a level of 3.5 times six compared to 2021. We have a very strong cash position with more than €260 million at the end of September, which excludes the proceeds from the recent global offering. Our chikungunya vaccine candidate progresses very nicely towards licensure. The rolling submission for BLA with U.S. FDA is ongoing and expected to complete by the end of 2022. On our Lyme disease candidate, again, great progress with the Phase 3 enrollment going to plan and expected to complete in the first half of next year.COVID-19 vaccine and syringe sitting over blue financial graph background. Selective focus. Horizontal composition with copy space. COVID-19 Vaccine and Stock market and finance concept.As we are moving our leading clinical assets, we are of course working hard on backfilling our pipeline. We are progressing some of our preclinical assets and we are trying to explore also options to inject other clinical stage assets into our pipeline. We have communicated in the past about our reshape strategy. Of course, reshape means for us, refocus on our key assets, winding down COVID, shifting focus away from COVID with a strong emphasis on our core assets, line check the commercial product, but also rebuilding the pipeline and it comes with also a resizing of the organization. This is a process that we have been planning for quite a while. We have been going through the necessary processes with workers council representatives and as we have seen, we are targeting a 20% to 25% reduction, which will in turn result in around €12 million operating cost savings on an annualized basis.Story continuesAnd Peter will develop those things more carefully and more in detail during the latter part of the presentation. If we look at the pipeline which is shown on Page 6 of the presentation, by way of reminder, chikungunya, as I said, our program right now on its way towards first licensure with BLA submission expected to be completed before the end of the year. The first company that will receive BLA approval might be eligible to a priority review voucher, which in turn we  of course expect to monetize, Lyme Phase 3 enrollment well underway, the way with the next milestone expected earlier next year partnered with Pfizer. And again, we are going to come back to those points in detail. You see here on the slide, also two assays that are marked in light blue.Many people ask us about where we stand on those. C. diff, our candidate that we progressed all the way to the end of Phase 2, we put this asset on hold, when Sanofi's data on C. diff came out and now we have following Pfizer's data on C. diff, we have decided to explore partnering for this asset, meaning out licensing for this asset. On Zika, we conducted a Phase 1 study successfully. And now that Zika got on the footprint from WHO and the target product profile for this or prioritizes inactivated vaccines we are currently considering reactivating that program. Then we have here as an example, put forward two of our preclinical assets, which at this point in time are being prioritized by Valneva. One is hMPV, clearly an interesting candidate prefusion subunit based that will approach its preclinical proof of concept by the end of this year and might be also an interesting candidate in a combination with RSV and our EBV candidate still earlier in the preclinical pipeline, but clearly a very interesting indication that we have prioritized at this point in time.And then at the bottom of the slide, you see our three commercial assets, IXIARO, our Japanese encephalitis vaccine. DUKORAL, our Cholera vaccine, and of course, our COVID vaccine BLA 2021, talking a little bit about Lyme, you are all well aware of the program, only one in clinical development against Lyme disease today. The Phase 3 followed three successful Phase 2 studies including in pediatrics. The program  is exclusively and worldwide partner with Pfizer based on a recombinant subunit approach with six serotypes. In order to ensure that the product can be used for people living or going to both sides of the Atlantic, it follows a well proven mode of action that was validated through placebo controlled field efficacy study back in the 90s.And the program is under Fast Track designation. The Phase 3 that is currently ongoing again, illustrated on Page 8 of the presentation. Right now, we are conducting a randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 study called VALOR, around 6,000 participants. Everyone about five years of age, currently being enrolled in the study, of course, we are running this study in high risk areas both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, randomization U.S., Europe two to one, zero versus placebo, one to one. And basically the primary endpoint is the rate of confirmed Lyme disease cases after the second season. And the secondary endpoint includes the rate of confirmed Lyme disease cases after the first season. So we are testing in one study already the booster that is expected to be needed after the first primary serious and then of course, subject tool and pending successful completion of the Phase 3 study.Pfizer could potentially submit a biological license application to the FDA and the MAA application to the European agencies in 2025. When we look at check, our program is still the most advanced chikungunya vaccine program in the world. We are well into our rolling submission process following successful clinical  pivotal clinical studies that met all endpoints, the program has FDA's breakthrough designation, Fast Track, EMA PRIME and I mentioned already the potential eligibility for the priority of review voucher. By way of reminder, it's a single shot life attenuated vaccine. So we expect that after a single shot, there will be a very long protection. We are currently studying at part of different antibody persistence studies for up to five years of duration.And we have also a partnership on this program through CEPI with Instituto Butantan where we are currently conducting an adolescent Phase 3. The data from those study I expected to extend the label, post-licensure and to add to further regulatory submissions for both adolescents and adults in other territories outside of the United States. We mentioned before that that it is our intention to commercialize this product ourselves because there's an excellent fit and the significant synergy within our commercial and industrial footprint. And when talking about market size, and of course as we are going closer to launch this becomes of course a very important question. We have reiterated at this point in time that we estimate the market to exceed €500 million annually by 2032, which is the point where we expect a decent penetration of this vaccine.The clinical data highlights again, summarized in this presentation. The key ones are really that we saw very high zero response rates that the basis for licensure is the so-called accelerated approval pathway. So there is an immunological surrogate to determine effectiveness of the vaccine. So this zero response rate shown to be at 98.9% after a single vaccination. The immunogenicity profile is maintained over time even at day 180, you see still 96.3%, interesting and very good across older adults, similar levels of zero response rates, neutralizing antibody titer as younger adults and then zero conversion, of course extremely high and 100% that isn't possible. From a safety perspective, overall well tolerated and a profile in terms of safety and tolerability that you would expect for this class of vaccine.What is also worth noting is we recently added a few data points to the study VLA1553, 301. And this had to do with additional data in elderly 65 years plus where we showed in the meantime also through an additional cohort  an additional readout that the zero response rates are at similar high levels. When we then come to the program progression towards FDA filing, we presented the program at the CDC's October ACIP meeting. The rolling submission got initiated as I mentioned earlier. And you see here the next steps with the breakthrough therapy designation priority review, the completion of the BLA submission by the end of 2022 and of course, the eligibility of the PRV. We presented an overview of VLA1553 at the ACIP meeting, there is no CHIK vaccine has been previously licensed.There are  therefore no existing ACIP recommendation existing at this point in time. The chikungunya working group provided a preliminary review and timetable plus ACIP recommendation decision and head of the anticipated February, 2024, ACIP vote, the working plans to present further on CHIK traveler epidemiology and disease burden, more comprehensive review of immunogenicity and safety data, as well as the so-called great assessment and longer term additional data in younger age groups. Yes, when we then look at the outlook what has still to come or what will still come on our program, VLA1553, the ongoing clinical trials that supports further regulatory submissions, of course, namely the antibody persistence study. I mentioned that this is a study that is of course a follow on from the previous studies that have already been initiated and we expect to follow respective volunteers for at least five years.The 12 months data are expected later this year. The latest clinical study I mentioned already 750 volunteers, age 12 to 17 years of age 12 months follow up and data expected in the first half next year. And then we may add additional studies to support future commercialization of the product, including co-vaccination, special populations. And then of course, the Phase 4 observation and effectiveness study. When we look at our commercial product portfolio, you see, of course here that we have strong sales of our commercial products in the first nine months. The product sales outside of COVID grew by 11.2% built prior period. We see a significant recovery in the travel markets with Japanese encephalitis in the travel segment increased significantly.We see product sales of cholera vaccine increased at similar well and the third-party products make significant contribution to our business. They increase to €18.4 million from €11.2 million in the comparable period in 2021. And this is of course related to one of our key distribution agreements, mainly with the Bavarian Nordic. Of course, we also sold COVID-19 vaccines as part of our EC APA. We generated €23.9 million in sales. All the deliveries to you member sales have been conducted. There's still some supplies to operating outstanding but overall this is where we stand on COVID. That we are still planning to seek potential opportunities outside of Europe and outside of the current licensed areas. Talking about COVID, the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe, we were the first ones to get an ordinary marketing authorization in Europe for this vaccine that is based on a more traditional, conventional technology coupled with a modern adjuvant CpG 1018 that gives the bias to Th1.We are still expecting few more data points on COVID, WHO may help us to sell the remaining inventory that we have specifically in international markets that we got already positive heterologous booster data following primary immunization with AstraZeneca's vaccine. We will expect some data also from people who got either primed with mRNA and/or natural infection. All of that is expected to conclude by the end of this year. And as we are moving along with this program, we are also extending the shelf life and stability data become available. And right now we are at 18 months  yes, at 15 months submitting for 18 months. And of course, we'll follow this through because inactivated vaccines have typically at least 24 months shelf life, if not longer.When we look at our resizing to reflect the evolution of the COVID-19 program, we've stated this at many different locations. In light of our reduced order volumes from the EU member states, we suspended our internal manufacturing as well as the external manufacturing. We entered into settlement agreement with our external partner IDT, for example. We retained our inventory for additional supplies. We are trying to deploy our inventory. We mentioned previously in between 8 million to 10 million doses. And yes, of course we ramped up the organization quite substantially in response to the anticipated COVID demand and specifically the significant COVID manufacturing quantities. So we are now reducing our workforce globally by approximately 20% to 25%, which still means that we will land at a level of 25% above headcount wise when compared to pre-COVID.And this is of course allowing us to retain talent and expertise that we build throughout the COVID period. And also to allow full focus on one of our key strategic pillars namely our R&amp;D progression, not only our late stage programs, but also the earlier stage pipeline development and potentially even injection of additional pipeline programs. With this, I would like to hand over to Peter to cloud off with the financial report.Peter Buhler: Thank you, Thomas. And good morning or good afternoon to all of you. Now let's discuss our first nine months financials. Total revenues reached €249.9 million, an increase of 258% compared to the first nine months of 2021. This increase is largely driven by other revenues and I will comment on that later. Product sales reached €74.4 million, an increase of 64%, which is prior year. This increases to a large extent driven by shipments of VLA2001, our COVID vaccine to European member states. At the same time, it also reflects the continued recovery of the travel market that leads to an increased demand in travel vaccines. Shipments to the U.S. Department of Defense continue to remain low, and this was anticipated based on this year's delivery schedule.The chart on the right side illustrates the composition of total revenues. The significant increase in revenues is to a large extent driven by other revenues that reached €175.5 million on a year-to-date basis. These other revenues comprise a release of refund liabilities that were previously reported on our balance sheet. Earlier in the year, we recognized €89.4 million other revenues related to payments from the UK government for our VLA2001 program. In Q3, we released €110.8 million advanced payments from European member states related to VLA2001 orders that were subsequently canceled. Other revenues also include negative revenues recognized in the second quarter related to price of contract revision. Moving onto Slide 19 to look at the details of our product sales.Sales of IXIARO decreased versus prior year, which is the result of the scheduled treatment to the U.S. Department of Defense. As indicated at the bottom of the table, IXIARO sales to the private market increased from €4.6 million in the first nine months of 2021 to €19.4 million in the current year, an increase of 270% at constant currency. DUKORAL sales reached €9.2 million in the nine months of 2022. A dramatic increase compared to the €500,000 reached in the prior year. Third-party product also had a solid performance and reached €18.4 million compared to €11.2 million in the first nine months of 2021. Finally, COVID-19 vaccine sales increased €3.8 million at the end of June to €23.9 million in September year-to-date, driven by shipments to European member states in Q3, as mentioned by Thomas earlier.Now moving on to Slide 20, looking at the P&amp;L. We already covered revenues at the significant increase of €249.9 million. Cost of goods and services also increased significantly over the prior year and this is of course, mainly driven by VLA2001 related costs. As explained in our first half year financials, we recognized significant inventory write-down in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. Research and development expenses decreased from €117.2 million in the first nine months of last year to €75.4 million in the first half of 2022. This decrease is driven by lower spend on clinical trials as our chikungunya vaccine progresses to its licensure, combined with a reduced spend on our COVID-19 vaccine candidate VLA2001. Marketing and distribution expense, as well as general and administrative expenses decreased compared to prior year, which is largely driven by a release of provision for share-based compensation and the related social security costs.The costs of Phantom Share Programs for certain employees, as well as the cost of social security on our equity plans depend on the development of Valneva share price. In total, we had a release of €30.6 million in the first nine months of 2022 compared to cost of €13.7 million in the same period of last year, i.e., a difference of over €40 million that possibly affected all expense fund in our P&amp;L and in particular, our G&amp;A expenses. As outlined in this morning's press release, the marketing and distribution line includes launch preparation cost for our chikungunya vaccine candidate of €4.3 million compared to €2.8 million in the prior year. Other income net of other expenses is reported at €7.5 million compared to €16 million in the first nine months of 2021.That decrease is primarily driven by lower R&amp;D tax credit as a direct result of the lower R&amp;D spend. Other expenses include a small increase in the provision of on the ongoing Vivalis/Intercell litigation proceedings. Operating loss for the first nine months is reported at €75.1 million compared to €237.6 million for the same period in 2021. Financial expense and income tax reached €42 million compared to an expense of €8.3 million in the prior year. The difference is primarily due to significant unrealized foreign exchange losses driven by U.S. dollar denominated liabilities. Interest expenses increased in line with the increased loan. The total loss for the period reaches €99.1 million versus €245.9 million in the first nine month of 2021.Next slide please. Looking at our COVID business, we see total revenues of €224.1 million and an operating loss of €14.2 million compared to an operating loss of nearly €200 million in the first nine months of 2021. The P&amp;L outside of COVID business shows product sales of €50.6 million and negative other revenues. As previously explained, the negative revenues are driven by the Pfizer agreement revision in Q2 with an adjusted cost sharing. Cost of goods and services systematically improved compared to last year, driven by lower cost of services related to Pfizer and the CTM unit in Sweden. In addition, the 2021 numbers was impacted by inventory write-offs and idle capacity costs. The level of operating expenses is, as already mentioned, favorably impacted by an effect related to the company's share plan.R&amp;D costs are significantly lower than in prior year. This is a direct consequence of our chikungunya vaccine moving towards licensure. The costs related to our preclinical programs are naturally lower, but will increase as this move into the clinical stage. The adjusted EBITDA of our non-COVID business reported for the first nine months reached negative €38.6 million, which is comparable to last year. Before moving to guidance, let's go to Slide 23 to look at our value proposition and how we expect to deliver on it. The first pillar talks about progression of our late stage clinical pipeline programs. We initiated the FDA submission of our chikungunya vaccine candidate and are preparing for the potential launch in the United States and later in Europe.At the same time, we continue our excellent collaboration with Pfizer on the Lyme program, and as mentioned by Thomas earlier, patient recruiting for Phase 3 trial is still ongoing. The second pillar is about progressing new vaccine candidates from preclinical to the clinical stage. This is clearly a priority as we are committed to refill our early stage clinical pipeline. For now, the focus is on HMPV program, as mentioned by Thomas earlier in this call. At the same time, we put in place a small dedicated team that is continuously screening the markets to look for potential in-licensing opportunities to complement our clinical pipeline. The third pillar is about maximizing our commercial products. We want to benefit from the recovering travel market and make sure our travel vaccines grow at least in line with the travel market.We are very encouraged by the growth we were able to realize with our distribution partnerships and the recently agreed deal with VBI is an illustration of our focus to complement our commercial proposition where it makes sense. Finally, as announced previously, we are aiming at selling additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines outside of Europe. This is an asset that will continue in 2023. Last column, we are in progress of resizing our operations. We initiated a program to reduce our workforce by 20% to 25% due to the discontinuation of our COVID program. The reduction in workforce is expected to result in annual savings of approximately €12 million and will be achieved through a combination of natural attrition and layoffs. These savings are to a launch extent expected in our manufacturing operations.The resizing of our organization will not impact our development projects as we are clearly committed to invest in what is required to bring forward our R&amp;D pipeline. Before moving to guidance, let me briefly comment on our cash situation. Our balance sheet at September 30 released this morning shows total cash and cash equivalents of €261 billion. While this is still a high level of cash, we consumed a significant amount during the third quarter. As a company, we believe it is important to be sufficiently financed to invest in our clinical and pre-clinical pipeline. We therefore decided to proceed with an equity offering at the end of September, and in a difficult market managed to raise over €100 million. The proceeds of this offering are not yet reflected in the September accounts and further strengthen our cash position.With this, the company's well positioned to deliver in our existing programs. Now, let's move to the fiscal year 2022 guidance on Slide 24. We reiterate our total revenue guidance of €340 to €360 million, including €30 million to €40 million of COVID vaccine and €70 million to €80 million other vaccine sales. As a reminder, we have increased the guidance for other vaccine sales at half year. Other revenues are anticipated at approximately €240 million, mainly based on revenues recognized from EC and UK COVID-19 contracts, meaning that these revenues will have no additional cash impact in Q4. We expect R&amp;D expenses to be between €95 million and €110 million quite a bit lower than previously announced. This decrease is related to some phasing of clinical trial expenses and the wind down of our VLA2001 activities.This concludes the finance section of this call, and I would like to hand back to Thomas for the upcoming catalyst.See also 12 Best Life Insurance Companies and 20 Biggest Employers in the World.Thomas Lingelbach: Thank you so much, Peter. Yes, let me summarize what we have already mentioned different points in this presentation, what are the clear near-term catalyst for Valneva online. It is of course, extremely important that we complete the enrollment on time given the seasonality of Lyme disease and the respective progression of the trials  of the trial over two seasons. We are also expecting some follow-up data from existing studies, which we have not specifically mentioned here on the key catalysts. On chikungunya, very clearly the completion of the BLA submission before the end of the year, of course, also supportive data like the antibody persistence data later this year or the adolescent data then in the earlier part of next year, which will be important to compliment the label and support submissions in other territories.On COVID-19, we expect further data till the end of the year, as I mentioned this before. And of course, we are  as we have clearly articulated in the past, in touch with a few international markets, meaning countries in Middle East, Asia, for example, where we are trying to a, seek regulatory approval and b, potential sales of our existing COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001 in respected inventory, this all of course to maximize the value from the existing assets. These are the key catalysts that we see. So still, very, very important anticipated news flow in  news flows in the short-term. And with that, I would like to hand back to the operator to take your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
174,73c8b1b0-5d3b-3222-8d73-423e37c68347,PFE,2022-12-30,Pfizer (PFE) Pentavalent Meningitis Jab BLA Gets FDA Acceptance,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-pfe-pentavalent-meningitis-jab-135301654.html,1672321981,STORY,"['PFE', 'ABBV']","[Pfizer PFE announced that the FDA has accepted the biologics license application (BLA) seeking approval of its pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate (MenABCWY).The BLA seeks approval of MenABCWY for adolescents and young adults, 10-25 years of age, for the prevention of meningococcal disease caused by five meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease: serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.The FDA has assigned a standard review to the BLA, with a decision expected in October 2023.Pfizer’s stock is down 14% this year so far against an increase of 12.1% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe BLA application as based on data from a phase III study, which evaluated MenABCWY in healthy individuals 10 through 25 years of age. The study met all primary and secondary endpoints. In the study, the vaccine candidate was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. The protection provided by two doses of MenABCWY was non-inferior to licensed vaccines (two doses of Pfizer’s own Trumenba + one dose of GSK’s [GSK] Menveo) for serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.The 5-in-1 meningitis vaccine candidate has the potential to simplify the meningococcal vaccination schedule by reducing the number of injections to be fully vaccinated compared to current FDA-approved meningitis vaccines as it has been designed to protect against the five serogroups with one combined product.GSK is also developing two MenABCWY pentavalent (5-in-1) vaccines. The first generation is in late-stage development and the second generation is in an earlier stage.MenABCWY is one of the five new molecular entities that Pfizer expects to launch in 2023. The other products include a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, ritlecitinib for alopecia, elranatamab for multiple myeloma and Abrilada, a biosimilar of AbbVie’s ABBV Humira.A BLA seeking approval of Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is under FDA’s priority review, with a decision expected in May 2023. GSK’s RSV vaccine for older adults is also under FDA’s priority review, with a decision expected on May 3, 2023. Regulatory applications seeking approval of GSK’s RSV vaccine are under review in Japan and Europe as well.Story continuesRitlecitinib is also under review in Europe and the United States, with an FDA decision expected in second-quarter 2023. The FDA approved Abrilada, Pfizer’s biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira in November 2019 but the product will be launched in 2023 once AbbVie loses exclusivity for the branded product. Abrilada is the fifth FDA-approved biosimilar to Humira.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderPfizer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The vicious beating was caught on film and eventually aired on networks for the entire nation to witness. Within hours of the announcement of the acquittal from the jury—which did not have a single Black juror—Los Angeles was engulfed in one of the worst civil disruptions in American history: with 50 people killed, more than 2,300 injured and about 1,100 damaged buildings at the cost of about $1 billion. Among its most devastated communities: South Central L.A.From those ashes rose an organization committed to economic empowerment and social justice. That thrust was voiced by enterprising John Hope Bryant when he founded Operation HOPE Inc. on May 5 of that year to change the status of legions locked in poverty. He began his campaign to move “from civil rights in the streets to silver rights in the suites” with a Bankers Bus tour to encourage investment within low-income communities by taking a small group of financial executives throughout distressed areas of L.A, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, among other urban hubs.Over the past three decades, Bryant has built the largest nonprofit dedicated to financial education and building partnerships with some of the nation’s financial services leviathans to meet its mission: Helping the poor and disenfranchised gain pathways to opportunity and wealth.A few weeks ago, I attended the Annual Hope Global Forums held at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta in the ballroom where Martin Luther King, Jr. launched the final campaign of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1967, months before an assassin’s bullet slew the civil rights leader. It was the first in-person gathering since the pandemic and two years after the slaying of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers—this time, the act of police misconduct was captured on video via cell phone, viewed throughout the globe in real-time, and initiated a renewed call for an end to systemic discrimination and a series of corporate equity pledges.Story continues(Image: Courtesy of Operation HOPE)This year’s event not only celebrated Operation HOPE’s three decades of achievements of serving more than 4 million individuals and directing more than $3.2 billion in economic activity into underserved communities nationwide, but it also sought to set the wealth agenda for Black Americans for 2023—and beyond. The Forum boasted roughly 5,000 delegates from 40 countries and included more than 1 million online viewers. Bryant asserts that the largest event of its kind has been designed “to reimagine the global economy, so the benefits and opportunities of free enterprise are extended to everyone.”As with previous forums, it presented an eclectic group of powerhouse speakers such as civil rights legend Ambassador Andrew Young, Bishop T.D. Jakes, rapper-entrepreneur Killer Mike, SBA Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman, MSNBC President Rashida Jones, Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastien, former Chief of Staff for Donald Trump, Mick Mulvaney, NASCAR President Steve Phelps, NBA Hall of Famer and entrepreneur Grant Hill, and U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), who had recently won a full term after defeating Republican and former Dallas Cowboys running back Herschel Walker in a contentious run-off election.Under the theme, “Bridging The Divide, “this year’s forum focused on finding solutions through wealth-building strategies, inclusive economics, and across-the-board equitable access. “The next move is about opportunity. The first Reconstruction in the 1800s focused on freedom. The second Reconstruction in the 1960s was about access. The third Reconstruction—2020 to 2030—will be about opportunity,” Bryant told the audience in the jam-packed ballroom. “You’re living in a moment of history.”“Homeownership is the No. 1 way to build wealth”That quote from Bryant summed up the wealth-building discussion—and for good reason. The yawning homeownership divide between Black and white families is now wider than it was more than 60 years ago, according to US Census Data. In 2022, 74.6% of white households owned homes versus 45.3% of Black households, a gap of more than 29 points. In 1960, the white homeownership rate was 65%, compared to the Black rate at 38%, a 27-point gap—before the 1968 Fair Housing Act and other civil rights legislation were enacted to remedy housing discrimination and create equitable opportunities.During the opening plenary, Bryant interviewed Kristy Fercho, Wells Fargo’s Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion, about the expansion of Black homeownership. Without further elaboration, Bryant mentioned that Wells Fargo, a long-time sponsor, “has a complicated history” and that he has held conversations with its CEO Charles W. Scharf about the bank’s corrective action in recent years.Fercho maintains the main reasons she agreed to join the bank in 2021, a year after the George Floyd tragedy: “I want to put more Blacks in homes. Homeownership is still the single largest purchase we will make [and] still the best pathway we have to generational wealth.” Fercho says she has taken the lead in the development and execution of the bank’s $150 million program to help roughly 60,000 Black customers refinance their homes and reduce their mortgage rates.Among the commitments Fercho announced was the creation of 120 new HOPE Inside locations to offer financial education services to enable community members to boost savings, improve credit scores, and shrink debt to convert more renters into homeowners.Operation HOPE currently has 200 such locations that provide financial counseling at various branches and workplaces of banking and corporate partners, including Bank of America, Truist, Synchrony, Delta, and UPS, among scores of others.To meet the homeownership mandate, Bank of America has also pledged Operation Hope to provide free financial counseling in 180 financial centers across 17 U.S. markets.Bryant also brought together business leaders to discuss financial education’s value and ensure that youth—from K-college—can learn about money matters as an academic requirement. Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon serves as Financial Literacy For All co-chair, which Bryant launched as a joint initiative with the big box retailer, Bank of America, Disney, and other corporations.Strengthening Black businessesOperation HOPE announced the continued expansion of its 1 Million Black Business (1MBB) initiative and has supported more than 155,000 unique businesses through its HOPE Inside network and 1MBB partners. According to the soon-to-be-released 1MBB 2022 Impact Report, the program has helped about 5% of all Black-owned businesses in the U.S. thus far.Through its alliance with Shopify, Operation Hope launched the initiative in October 2020 to help create and support up to 1 million new Black-owned businesses by 2030. Shopify committed resources valued at approximately $130 million. In addition, Operation HOPE has built a coalition of more than 60 other corporate, government, and private partners, including SBA, the NFL, MasterCard, Comcast, and Clark Atlanta University.The Forum also featured the second annual 1MBB Pitch Competition, featuring four innovative Black entrepreneurs who shared their personal and business journeys for the opportunity to win a total of $50,000. Operation Hope and Shopify developed the competition, with PayPal as its title sponsor.Following a nationwide competition, the 2nd annual 1MBB pitch finalists were Kalene McElveen, owner of Tastefull Vegan Frozen Desserts, which took first-place honors with a $2,500 grant from Shopify and $15,000 from PayPal; Jazmin Richards, founder and CEO of BLK Sunflowers. A candle manufacturer,  which gained second place and a $2,500 grant from Shopify and $10,000 from PayPal; Joshua Dixon, founder and designer of apparel maker Admire Wear, who won a $2,500 grant from Shopify and $8,000 from PayPal; and Stacy Howell, owner of Woodhouse Spa, who took home a $2,500 grant from Shopify and $7,000 from PayPal.In Bryant’s conversation with Jakes, the senior pastor of the Dallas-based megachurch Potters House applauded the need to launch and support Black entrepreneurial endeavors. Still, he asserted the need for Black firms to scale up for greater impact as viable employment and investment sources.“One of the problems with our businesses is that they have two to three employees at most. They’re so busy doing the work, they’re not thinking about the business,” says Jakes. “I have to strategize the business. I have to integrate the business. They don’t understand the difference between busyness and business.”Bryant and Operation HOPE will continue emphasizing the most vital plank for the next wealth agenda: Opportunity.]"

The report states that scammers target states with densely populated cities in order to reach as many people as possible.However, even if you don’t live in one of those states, it’s important to stay vigilant and never click on a link (or otherwise engage) when you are unsure whether a text you receive is legitimate. Instead, directly contact the company, service or person the text is allegedly from to verify its legitimacy.Here are five new text message scams that will take your money.Amazon Text Message ScamAs part of this scam, you’ll receive a text message stating it’s from Amazon. It also will state that there is a problem with your Amazon account and prompt you to verify your personal information by clicking the provided link. Of course, the link is not from Amazon and any personal information you provide will be delivered to a scammer.Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?Netflix Text Message ScamOne of the most recent Netflix scams involves texts claiming to be from the popular streaming service to notify you that your payment for your Netflix subscription has failed.

Either action will expose you and your personal information to the scammers.Two-Factor Authentication Text Message ScamTwo-factor authentication is a way to keep scammers from hackers from accessing your account even when they have your username and password. So the object of this scam is to get you to give up your authentication code.You’ll receive a text appearing to be from a company or service you do business with that states it has detected suspicious login activity on your account, which will be locked unless you can prove you are the owner. The text will state that once you receive your two-factor authentication code to recover your account, you should text it as a reply. Once you do, the scammer will have access to your account.It’s important to note that you will never be asked for your two-factor authentication code by a security team through a text or otherwise.UPS Text Message ScamDuring this scam, you’ll receive a text notifying you about a UPS delivery, complete with fake tracking numbers, that was missed and needs to be rescheduled. The text will prompt you to click a link to set a new delivery date. If you click a link, several things could happen, including your phone being infected with malware or being routed to a phishing site, which will ask you for personal information, including your name, address, credit card information and Social Security number.More From GOBankingRatesTarget, Amazon and 4 More Retailers That Will Reward You for Turning in Your Old StuffWrite Off Your Mileage?

179,20c5988d-e2d2-39f5-bc17-a8fd601f93cd,IBM,2022-12-30,Investing in the Future of Work: How IBM Is Tackling the Credentials Dilemma,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-future-ibm-tackling-credentials-162000866.html,1672330800,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 29, 2022 / IBMIBM, Thursday, December 29, 2022, Press release pictureThis week I had the pleasure of participating in JFF Horizons, where I spoke about the importance of a skills-first approach to workforce development. This is something my team and I work on every day at IBM because we're committed to investing in the future of work, with a focus on underrepresented communities. It was inspiring to hear from many other thought-leaders who are championing this movement and some IBM partners who are helping us drive progress in developing the ecosystem needed to advance a skills-first approach.When we look at the state of hiring today, we know many talented individuals have the knowledge, skills, and abilities companies are looking for, but the system that we have doesn't work well for applicants or employers. We need a modernized system where learners' credentials are portable, verifiable, and use common frameworks making them valued and accessible to employers and academic institutions. This has been an issue of concern for a while now, but it's taking on greater importance and visibility as companies struggle to hire. Surveys show us that talent shortages in the U.S. have reached a 10-year high and that this shortage is even worse among tech workers with more than 1.2 million U.S. job vacancies in software-related professions.To address this dilemma, companies need to see beyond the old paradigm of skills vs. degrees and create an integrated system of training, credentials, and degrees that meets the needs of individuals and employers. One that acknowledges that people's school to work journey is not a direct path, nor does it end with a degree program, but rather is one that may cross secondary and post-secondary education, professional training, and skills acquired through work with or without a degree.Many companies are talking about hiring candidates without degrees but aren't executing a new strategy to get them into gateway careers. As an employer offering training programs and an issuer of credentials, IBM is investing in the future of work with a multi-pronged approach:Story continuesapplying our technology to improve the structures and systems that underpin the new ecosystem;pioneering practices in our hiring and education programs; andadvocating for policies that will help other employers and training providers.We can do more and we should all work together and take the following steps to create the ecosystem we need:First, we must review and rewrite job descriptions to ensure they are open, inclusive, and skills-based. Today at IBM, more than 50% of our US job openings don't require a 4-year degree.Secondly, we need to work together to enable credentials to be recognized by employers across the market and by academic institutions alike. For example, we recently announced partnerships with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Specialisterne Foundation to equip U.S. military veterans and neurodivergent learners worldwide with the training and credentials they need for high-demand technology careers.This week, I also had the pleasure of meeting with the Community College Workforce Coalition to talk about the systemic issues and structural pain points we face together. Community colleges have always played a valuable multi-dimensional role in our communities to deliver training and create a market-responsive degree and non-degree pathways. Whether students attend a community college to pursue a degree or to upskill for a job, individual credentials can be earned along the way and help them make progress towards their goals.IBM is committed to extending skills training and technology credentials and making sure we provide free education to individuals from underrepresented communities. I encourage everyone from the private, public, and non-profit sectors to think about this important work. Together, we can tackle the talent shortage, close the skills gap, and create access to careers in tech for those who have traditionally been excluded. Let's create the partnerships we need to validate credentials and close the skills gap.To learn more about what IBM is doing across education and workforce development, click here: skillsbuild.orgView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/733572/Investing-in-the-Future-of-Work-How-IBM-Is-Tackling-the-Credentials-Dilemma]"

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The US and the global economy are dealing with high inflation, causing the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world to raise benchmark interest rates. Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since February 2022 and COVID-related updates from China have also played a significant role in increasing global uncertainty and escalating recession-related concerns. All these adverse developments have resulted in the leading market indices like the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index posting a year-to-date (YTD) decline of 19.3%, 8.6%, and 32.9%, respectively.Under such circumstances, the famous phrase “cash is king” comes into play often. This means that during uncertain macroeconomic times, cash becomes more valuable than any other form of investment as it provides strength to the balance sheet and acts as a safety net. Popular companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are considered among the best cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds. These companies have also used their cash balances strategically to acquire assets at attractive prices, which has helped these corporations combat the market downturn more aggressively.10 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have shortlisted stocks with strong cash reserves as of Q3 2022 and have ranked them according to the hedge fund sentiment.

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $16.19 billionGeneral Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a Boston, Massachusetts-based industrial conglomerate.The company intends to spin off its healthcare division as a separate publicly listed entity in the first week of 2023. However, it must be noted that the cash balance would not be impacted significantly as a cash balance of $500 million has been allocated to the healthcare division as of September 30. Furthermore, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) will also hold a 19.9% stake in the newly spun-off entity.Not only numerous hedge funds are invested in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), but analysts are also bullish on the stock. Julian Mitchell at Barclays assigned General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock a target price of $96 along with an Overweight rating on December 16. The analyst updated his financial estimates to incorporate the impact of spinning off the healthcare business. Experts also believe that the industrial giants are finding pricing support, an improvement in costs, and ease in the supply chain that would be favorable for the bottom line.9. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $26.21 billionGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Detroit, Michigan-based automaker that is focused on becoming a leader in the field of electric vehicles (EV).During Investor Day in November, the company shared its electrification plan with analysts and investors. Dan Ives at Wedbush was impressed by the presentation and thinks that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has taken a bullish stance on the overall demand for EVs and its battery production targets. The management looks very confident in achieving those targets, and the significant cash reserve can play an integral part. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) anticipates its top line to compound annually by 12% between the 2023 - 2025 period to reach the $225 billion milestone.The EV segment is expected to contribute $50 billion to the top line by 2025. In August 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) restored its quarterly dividend after suspending it at the start of the pandemic and also increased its share buyback plan from $3.3 billion to $5 billion.Here's what Chartwell Investment Partners said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes General Motors (NYSE:GM, 2.4%), down 27.4%. GM posted solid first-quarter earnings, but, supply issues continue to be a headwind and the market appears to be “pricing-in” at least a mild recession. The question seems to be: by the time the supply constraints are resolved, will we be in a much-worse economic scenario that will “hit” the demand side?After a couple quarters of higher-than-average trading, Q2 was extremely light in both the Growth &amp; Balanced and Dividend Equity accounts (see below). After trimming GM earlier in the year at much higher price levels, we added back to the position. Now trading at $32 per share, GM’s P/E multiple on 2022 earnings estimates is below 5 times its annual earnings per share, which we think is very attractive and is already pricing-in at least a mild recession.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $36.13 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical company.Experts believe Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has built up its cash position due to the tailwinds from the COVID-19 vaccine. The company is now using the cash balance intelligently to acquire companies that integrate with its operations to create synergies and also expand its offerings. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of New Haven, Connecticut-based Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for a sum of $11.6 billion in May 2022. Following that, the company announced the takeover of San Francisco, California-based Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) for $5.4 billion.On December 13, Chris Shibutani at Goldman Sachs upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and increased the target price from $47 to $60. The analyst highlighted the positive pipeline of products that are expected to outperform estimates following their commercial launch in 2023. This can drive significant value to the base business of the company. These developments have also reduced Pfizer Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) reliance on the prolonged outperformance of COVID-19 vaccines.Here's what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7.

United is now the largest domestic airline carrier in terms of the number of destinations served.As the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines domestic revenues (U.S. and Canada) accounted for 68.4% of total revenues in 2021. Atlantic, Pacific, and Latin American regions accounted for 13.9%, 6.12%, and 11.6% respectively in 2021. Earnings are now expected at $2.18 per share in 2022, climbing from an adjusted loss of -$13.94 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to climb 197% to $6.48 per share. Even better, earnings estimates are largely up for both FY22 and FY23 over the last 90 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are expected to jump 82% this year and rise another 14% in FY23 to $51.09 billion. More importantly, FY23 would represent 18% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $43.25 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe top-line recovery certainly justifies buying United stock for 2023 and beyond. Despite UAL being down -13% year to date, it has outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -22% and the Transportation-Airline Markets -24%. Over the last decade, UAL stock is up +47% to underperform the benchmark but outperformed its Zacks Subindustry’s +10%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe can also see from the decade chart that United stock was outperforming the benchmark before the Covid-19 pandemic. Trading 38% off its 52-week highs at $37 a share, UAL has a forward P/E of 17.1X. This is slightly above the industry average of 14.1X but well below its decade-high of 747.2X and closer to the median of 8.8X. With rising earnings estimates also supporting United’s valuation, the average Zacks Price Target suggests 40% upside from current levels.Story continuesDelta Air Lines DAL Another airline stock investors may want to consider going into the new year is Delta Air Lines. Controlling roughly 17% of the domestic travel market Delta is also the second-largest global airline in terms of passengers carried and has the highest revenue of any airline in the world.Delta stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimates trending higher for fiscal 2022. Earnings are now projected to be $3 a share this year, up from a loss of -$4.08 per share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to climb 67% to $5.01 a share but earnings estimates have trended down over the last quarter.Sales are forecasted to climb 59% in FY22 and jump another 16% in FY23 to $55.29 billion. Plus, FY23 would represent 17% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $47 billion. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDelta stock is down -17% year to date to slightly top the S&amp;P 500 and its Zacks Subindustry. Over the last decade, DAL’s +150% performance has crushed the Transportation-Airline Markets +10% and is competitive with the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading roughly 30% from its highs, this year’s decline could be a nice buying opportunity looking at Delta’s historical performance. Delta currently trades at $32 a share and at just 10.6X forward earnings which is below the industry average of 14.1X. Even better, DAL shares trade well below their decade-long high of 30.6X and near the median of 9.2X. The average Zacks Price Target offers 56% upside from current levels.Bottom Line United and Delta may once again become the cream-of-the-crop stocks to invest in the airline industry. Despite recent weather challenges, travel demand is expected to be robust in 2023 as traveling and vacationing continue to normalize post-pandemic. The Transportation-Airline Industry is currently in the top 15% of over 250 Zacks Industries and United and Delta looked poised to benefit.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This route was suspended when the pandemic was wreaking havoc.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1Southwest Airlines canceled 62% of its flights on Dec 27. What is worse is that LUV’s rivals have seen their operations being disrupted at a much lower scale.  We note that LUV is the biggest carrier serving Buffalo, NY, the hardest-hit urban area by this natural catastrophe. Management has apologized to passengers for the harassment they had to face due to the disruption in operations. The disruption is likely to hit LUV’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance. Many market watchers believe that it will take around a week for LUV to recover from this fiasco of gigantic proportions.LUV was also in the news recently when the union, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, covering its customer service employees, ratified a pay-related deal. That story was covered in the previous week’s write-up.2. UAL will resume operating non-stop flights from Denver to Tokyo from Mar 4, 2023. Return flights from Tokyo’s Narita International Airport to Denver International Airport will start taking to the skies from Mar 5, 2023. Initially, the service will be available three times a week. Flights will depart from Denver to Tokyo on Monday, Thursday and Saturday. Return flights to Denver will take to the skies on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Flights on the route will operate daily from Mar 25, 2023. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here3. Ryanair Holdings RYAAY along with the likes of Wizz Air and easyJet, will reportedly face an inquiry by anti-trust authorities in Italy over allegations of price-fixing. The allegations surfaced for flights operated by the airlines in and out of Sicily. The enquiry is expected to be completed by 2023-end. A complaint of price-fixing lodged by consumer group Codacons has led to the investigation.Story continues4. With COVID-19 cases on the rise in China, the United States has announced that passengers coming to the country from China, Hong Kong or Macau are required to show negative COVID-19 test reports. The requirement will come into force from Jan 5, 2023 and is applicable to passengers above two years. Per the new rule announced by the Biden administration, passengers traveling to the United States directly from China and also those who were in the country 10 days before their departure to the United States will have to take a COVID-19 test (no more than two days before travel) and furnish a negative report before boarding the flight.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) so let's look a bit deeper.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for CSX, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$5.8b ÷ (US$42b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, CSX has an ROCE of 15%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for CSX compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for CSX.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsCSX's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 31% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, CSX is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with a respectable 73% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for CSX  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

RCL is no exception. Year to date, the stock is down 37.6%, compared with the industry’s decrease of 40.9%. The decline can be primarily attributed to COVID-19 and inflationary pressure.Negative investor sentiments were witnessed as the company cited inflationary and supply-chain challenges (related to fuel and food costs) and transitory costs related to health and safety protocols. The company anticipates the hurdles to weigh on its 2022 earnings.For fourth-quarter 2022, net cruise costs, excluding fuel per APCD, are likely to increase by low to mid-single digits in comparison to 2019 levels. These includs expected transitory costs related to health protocols and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp-up. The company anticipates inflationary and supply-chain challenges to persist for some time.Can the Stock Stage a Comeback in 2023?This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s sales and earnings in fiscal 2023 are expected to witness growth of 43.6% and 138.3% year over year, respectively. In the past 60 days, earnings estimates for 2023 have witnessed upward revisions of 25% to $2.95 per share.In 2023, the company is likely to benefit from the addition of new ships. In 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova.The company stated that Icon will have eight distinct neighborhoods and that its stateroom configuration will allow load factors to be accretive to the overall portfolio. Also, it reported a solid market response in terms of bookings. The company anticipates the ship to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring third-quarter 2022, the company unveiled a three-year financial performance initiative, Trifecta Program, thereby articulating longer-term financial objectives. The program emphasizes on financial coordinates, including adjusted EBITDA per APCD, adjusted EPS and ROIC, with an intent to achieve it by 2025 end. Under this program, the company expects to achieve a triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, exceeding the earlier recorded adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019.The company also expects to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings per share, exceeding the earlier recorded adjusted earnings per share of $9.54 in 2019. The company anticipates achieving a return on invested capital in the teens by the end of 2025. RCL intends to achieve the metrics on account of its underlying strategies, robust secular and demographic trends, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline.Improvement in booking is likely to aid the company’s performance in 2023. During the third quarter, the company reported accelerating demand for sailings in 2023. It stated that booking volumes for 2023 doubled during the third quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022.

To skip our detailed analysis of wide moat stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Small Cap Stocks With Wide Moats.The beginning of 2022 saw big losses for small-cap stocks, but this soon began to change, as seen by the performance of such stocks as of this July. These stocks have historically been attractive to investors looking to invest early in companies that have a chance of rapidly growing since their market capitalizations are contained within the figures of $300 million to $2 billion. With market caps, this low, small-cap stocks are typically considered to be attractive options for those looking to find a diamond in the rough. Small-cap stocks outperforming the market in July also helped increase the popularity of these stocks among investors. According to a Wall Street Journal article published this July, the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap companies rose by 3.6% that month, while the S&amp;P 500 fell behind with its 3% increase.Larger companies with more recognizable names, like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) have always been investor favorites. However, the performance of small-cap stocks observed above has made these companies also gain in popularity again this year. Investors are now beginning to focus more on small companies with a niche business model that offers them a huge competitive advantage, thus promising long-term growth. Such companies are said to have a wide economic moat.What are wide moat stocks?Companies with attractive pricing and a sustainable competitive advantage are called wide moat companies. A company's moat is rapidly becoming one of the leading metrics in investment strategies to pick those stocks that offer prospective growth because of their command over a particular sector. One index that provides exposures to such companies is the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index, comprising companies with Morningstar Economic Moat Ratings of Wide that are trading at the lowest current market price with fair value ratios.Story continuesAccording to a Morningstar Equity Research report, as of 2020, the Wide Moat Focus Index generated an average annual outperformance of 363 basis points versus its benchmark since its 2007 inception date. The Index's annual total return for 2020 stood at 10.71%, compared to an annual total return of 6.91% for the Morningstar US Market Index, which is its benchmark. This shows the capability of wide moat stocks to outperform the general market, leading to their increased popularity among investors today.10 Small Cap Stocks With Wide MoatsSource: pexelsLet's now take a look at the 10 small cap stocks with wide moats.Our MethodologyFor our list below, we have selected stocks with market capitalizations between $400 million and $2 billion dollars.

However, the reservoir description segment-which is more reliant upon international activity (both onshore and offshore)-has recovered more slowly. The company’s global rig count, which has historically been a leading indicator of future reservoir description activity, has improved recently, giving us confidence in the business’s longer-term fundamentals.”Core Laboratories N.V.

Suni Lee competed strictly in NCAA gymnastics since winning the Tokyo Olympic all-around, but she announced last month that this sophomore season will be her last for the Auburn Tigers. Lee plans to return to elite, Olympic-level gymnastics after this winter. She hasn’t announced her comeback meet, but she has plenty of time ahead of the most significant domestic competitions in August.Meanwhile, Simone Biles said in September that she plans to be at the Paris Olympics. She just has to decide whether that will be as an athlete or a spectator. Biles hasn’t provided further updates since but, as of the third quarter of this year, was still getting drug tested. That’s significant because if Biles does not withdraw her name from the testing pool, she is excused from the six-month waiting period to return to competition for athletes who leave and then re-enter the testing pool.Then there’s 2012 Olympic all-around champ Gabby Douglas. She last competed at the 2016 Rio Games, but reports — and a photo — from this fall indicated she has been training at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy in Texas, which produced Olympic all-around champions Carly Patterson and Nastia Liukin and reigning U.S. all-around champion Konnor McClain. Douglas hasn’t commented publicly, and her representative said Wednesday there is nothing new to report.What will Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone race? For the first time, McLaughlin-Levrone has a bye into the world championships as a reigning gold medalist. That means she can race the 400m hurdles at August’s worlds in Budapest without entering the event at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in July. Athletes with byes sometimes compete in other events at nationals. Mix that with her comments from this fall that she wants to add the flat 400m to her program — but not give up the hurdles, yet at least — and we have our burning question.Story continuesWhen McLaughlin-Levrone made those fall comments, no concrete decision had been made about a possible 400m/400m hurdles double bid in 2023 (or 2024). At worlds, the women’s 400m hurdles first round heats start 2 hours and 20 minutes before the women’s 400m semifinals. Top-level pros rarely race multiple times in one session in a distance longer than 200 meters at any meet.The Olympic schedule is accommodating as ever for a possible women’s 400m/400m hurdles double in 2024 (no woman has ever earned a medal in both races at one Olympics or worlds). For the first time in Olympic history, none of the rounds of those races take place on the same day at the Games. But doing both through the finals would still be a challenge: racing six consecutive days at the Olympics (and a seventh day at the end if adding the 4x400m relay).Will Caeleb Dressel compete in 2023, and if so, when? Dressel, who won five golds at the Tokyo Games, withdrew on unspecified medical grounds during June’s world championships after winning his first two finals. He hasn’t competed since and last provided an update on Sept. 4, saying he was happy, had not swum since worlds and missed swimming. He ended the social media post with the line, “I’ll be back.”The next major meet is the U.S. Championships from June 27-July 1, the qualifying meet for the world championships in Japan later in July. In Dressel’s absence, Olympic 200m fly champion Kristof Milak became the new world champion in the 100m fly, where Dressel holds the world record. In the 100m freestyle, where Dressel had been the world’s fastest man outside of the super-suit era, 18-year-old Romanian David Popovici won the world title and then broke the world record.Is Katie Ledecky headed for a Race of the Century? Swimming worlds may also produce the most anticipated head-to-head-to-head race in 18 years. The women’s 400m freestyle could pit Ledecky (reigning world champion) against Australian Ariarne Titmus (reigning Olympic champion) and 16-year-old Canadian phenom Summer McIntosh. This year, Titmus broke Ledecky’s world record but skipped a showdown with Ledecky at the world championships in prioritizing the Commonwealth Games. McIntosh took silver to Ledecky at worlds, becoming the fourth-fastest woman in history.The hype has been compared to the “Race of the Century,” when Michael Phelps, Aussie Ian Thorpe and Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband met in the 200m free at the 2004 Athens Games (won by Thorpe).Will Mikaela Shiffrin break one of Alpine skiing’s historic records? Shiffrin heads into 2023 in arguably her best form since her incredible 2018-19 season, winning her last four races across three different disciplines to reach 80 World Cup wins. She is two victories shy of Lindsey Vonn‘s female record and six away from Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark‘s overall record that has stood since he retired in 1989. Shiffrin getting to 87 would be the most significant accomplishment in American ski racing — outside of the Olympics — since her breakout world title at age 17 in 2013.Shiffrin is 27 years old and expects to compete at least through the 2026 Winter Games. If she gets to 87 World Cup wins in 2023, having averaged about eight victories per season, you have to start wondering whether 100 is possible.What happens with Russian athletes? Russians and Belarusians in most Olympic sports have been banned from international competition since the invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago. Olympic sports leaders have discussed since at least September how athletes who do not endorse the war could return in the future. The International Olympic Committee is not yet recommending the lifting of the bans, but did say it planned to explore the possibility of Russian athletes taking part in Olympic qualifying competitions in Asia rather than Europe.A key sport is gymnastics. Russian gymnasts won men’s and women’s team gold at the Tokyo Games. As rules currently stand, Russians must compete at their continental championships this year (April for Europe, May or June for Asia) to remain eligible to qualify full teams for the Paris Games.Will any U.S. beach volleyball gold medalist return? The Olympic beach volleyball qualifying window runs from January 2023 into June 2024. It looks likely to start with no public word from reigning gold medalists Alix Klineman and April Ross on whether either will bid for the Paris Games. Klineman, 32, hasn’t competed since shoulder surgery last January. Ross, 40, last competed in March, then withdrew before June’s world championships, where she was entered with Emily Day, with an unspecified injury.“I’m weighing a lot of factors, a lot of life factors, a lot of, you know, opportunity factors,” Ross said earlier this month. “There’s a lot of things that are appealing to me at the moment, and I just have to decide which direction I want to go. But yeah, I still feel like I have a lot of good years of volleyball left in me.”Kerri Walsh Jennings, the most decorated Olympic beach volleyball player with four medals (three gold), has been working out on Hermosa Beach with 2000 Olympic indoor teammate Logan Tom, according to videos posted by Buzzle this month. Walsh Jennings, 44, last played a tournament in June 2021, when she and then-partner Brooke Sweat were eclipsed for the second and last U.S. spot for the Tokyo Games. Walsh Jennings said last spring that she wanted Tom to be her new partner, then said in October that she should have an answer on her 2024 Olympic bid plans after the start of the new year.The gold medalists have some time to deliberate, but probably need to return at some point in 2023 or risk falling significantly behind in qualifying for two Olympic spots. The U.S. has two strong, younger pairs in Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, who won the most recent top-level international event earlier this month, and Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss, who won five times between the domestic AVP and international FIVB tours in 2022.Will Stephen Curry join Steve Kerr at the 2023 FIBA World Cup? (Getty)Which NBA superstars will suit up for USA Basketball? The U.S. men’s basketball team may face a gigantic threat at the Paris Games (more on that in the next burning question), but first comes the quadrennial FIBA World Cup in August and September. Recall four years ago that the Americans, with just two reigning NBA All-Stars on the team and one player with Olympic experience, lost twice at the World Cup en route to their worst major tournament result ever — seventh place.After Gregg Popovich coached the team to a bounce-back gold in Tokyo, Steve Kerr succeeded him as head coach. Grant Hill followed Jerry Colangelo as national team managing director. Will America’s best players sign up to travel around the globe — the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia co-host worlds — a month before NBA preseason training camps?Which country will Joel Embiid play for? The Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center, who was born in Cameroon, gained French nationality and U.S. citizenship this year, potentially making him eligible to represent any of those nations in international basketball. Embiid has not yet announced his choice, if he decides to play at all, but France’s GM expressed confidence last month.If Embiid joins France, it could give the Olympic host country triplet towers with fellow 7-footers Rudy Gobert and Victor Wembanyama, an 18-year-old whom LeBron James described as a one-of-a-kind talent. That could pose problems for the U.S. Anthony Davis, who skipped the Tokyo Olympics, is the lone U.S. center to make an All-NBA first, second or third team in the last five seasons.Can Kelly Slater qualify for Olympic surfing at age 51? Many thought surfing’s debut in Tokyo was Slater’s only shot at the Olympics. He missed the team by one spot when it came down to the last event of yearlong qualifying. Then Slater came back in February to win the most prestigious contest in the sport — the Pipeline Masters — 30 years after he won it for the first time. Slater didn’t make the quarterfinals of any other event and finished the 2022 season ranked fifth among American men in world standings.The top two American men in next year’s standings likely qualify for the Olympics. In a change from Tokyo, the U.S. has the chance to earn a third Olympic men’s spot if it wins the 2024 World Surfing Games. That spot can be filled via discretionary pick.Will the 2030 Winter Olympic and Paralympic host be decided? The IOC announced earlier this month that the 2030 host is no longer expected to be decided before next fall, citing wider discussions into the future of the Winter Games, including the effects of climate change and the possibility of rotating the Games within a pool of hosts.Previously, Salt Lake City, Sapporo, Japan, and Vancouver were confirmed as bids. Then in October, the British Columbia government said it would not support a Vancouver bid, a major setback, though organizers did not say that decision ended the bid. Then last week, Japanese officials announced a pause in the active promotion of the Sapporo bid that may include a national survey asking the public whether it wants to host the Games.U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee officials have said Salt Lake City is a likelier candidate for 2034 than 2030 — with Los Angeles already hosting the 2028 Summer Games — but could step in for 2030 if asked.OlympicTalk is on Apple News.

Global crude topped $139 a barrel in March then cooled as central bank rate hikes threatened to tip economies into recession. Oil settled at $85.91 per barrel on Friday, up 10% on the year.In Europe, the benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract ended about 8% higher, down from the record highs seen earlier in the year as Europe successfully built up gas stocks.Story continuesU.S. gas futures jumped by more than 20% and Dutch wholesale gas prices rose by almost 8%, both up for a third consecutive year.Graphic: Energy futures 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/egvbyygqlpq/Pasted%20image%201672300742485.pngBecause Europe will continue to import LNG to rebuild gas inventories next year after winter, gas prices are expected to remain elevated as limited new supplies come onstream.The dismantling of tight pandemic controls in China, the world's second-largest LNG importer, could also promote economic recovery and greater LNG consumption next year.However, a European cap on gas prices starting in February could keep a lid on the market and reduce the volatility seen this year.In industrial metals, copper on the London Metal Exchange is on track to fall 13% this year and aluminium is down about 15%. Both reached record highs in March.Graphic: Metals performance 2022 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/lgpdkkbajvo/Pasted%20image%201672300176258.pngSpot prices of iron ore bound for China, which consumes about two-thirds of global supply, have fallen about 4% this year, ending near $118 per tonne.Citi analysts are bearish on nickel and zinc for the next six to 12 months, seeing strong supply growth, and bullish on iron ore and aluminium.""Iron ore is expected to remain strong in the near term and could follow through in the bull case of a major China credit easing,"" they said in a note.China's U-turn on COVID policy and its pledge to increase support for the real estate sector helped to support ferrous and non-ferrous metals in December.Still, optimism has been tempered by the country's surging COVID infections and risks of global recession in 2023 if central banks, as expected, keep hiking rates.Nickel, the outperformer in metals, is on course for a 45% rise, its largest since 2010, partly because of a shortage of metal that can be delivered against the LME contract and partly because of volatility created by low volumes and liquidity after a trading fiasco in March.RISING FOOD PRICESBenchmark Chicago wheat futures jumped to an all-time high of $13.63-1/2 a bushel in March on supply disruptions. Fewer grain exports from Ukraine further pressured a market already higher on adverse weather and COVID-19 related restrictions. Wheat ended the year up about 3%, however, after a tentative renewal of some Ukrainian exports.Corn and soybeans hit a decade high, while Malaysia's benchmark crude palm oil prices climbed to an all-time record. Soybeans and corn both ended the year up around 14%, as severe drought in Argentina raised concerns about South America's crop.Graphic: Grains, edible oil prices - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdvzqqgjrpw/Pasted%20image%201672304115449.pngGoing forward, food-commodity prices are likely to stay elevated. Wheat production is unlikely to replenish depleted world inventories, at least in the first half of 2023, while crops producing edible oils are suffering from adverse weather in Latin America and Southeast Asia.""U.S. winter wheat is facing harsh cold weather and, even if the crop improves, we will have those supplies (only) in the second half of 2023,"" said a Singapore-based trader at an international trading company.The rice market, which sat out the rally in grain prices in the first half of the year, got a boost after India, the world's biggest exporter, decided in September to curb supplies. India's 5% broken parboiled rice is up almost 6% in 2022 and Vietnam's 5% broken rice has gained more than 15%.Among precious metals, gold has lost around 1% in 2022, down for a second year, silver is up almost 3%, platinum has gained 11% and palladium is down 5%.As worries over recession cloud consumer demand, coffee is among the biggest commodities losers of the year. Robusta fell 24% in 2022 and arabica lost more than a quarter of its value, also impacted by expectations of a bumper crop in top grower Brazil.Tokyo rubber has lost more than 8% while raw sugar was up more than 6%. ICE cotton has dropped more than 26% in 2022 on softening demand.(Reporting by Naveen Thukral and Florence Tan; Additional reporting by Emily Chow, Enrico Dela Cruz and Pratima Desai; Editing by Caroline Stauffer, Barbara Lewis and Matthew Lewis)]"

BTC has now been balancing roughly between $16,400 and $17,000 for 13 days amid investor sluggishness typical for a year's closing days. Crypto markets would also rather forget acquaintances – auld and new – to 2022 even as they gird for more rough times ahead in 2023.""Bitcoin continues to happily tread water and watch the storm pass as it fluctuates in a range of around $16,000-$17,000,"" wrote Craig Erlam, senior markets editor for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""That's broadly been the case over the last couple of weeks and it doesn't look like changing in the coming days, barring any unexpected headlines.""Erlam added: ""The question for many now is whether it has bottomed and how long it will take confidence to return, enabling a strong recovery. I'm not convinced by either in the near term and think there are plenty more twists and turns to come early next year.""Story continuesEther was recently changing hands slightly below $1,200 but up 0.8% from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos were mixed with ETC, the token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain project, rising about 4% and popular meme coin SHIB up nearly 3%, but SOL's sad saga continuing, with the token of the embattled Solana blockchain, plummeting more than 12% at one point. SOL erased those losses after Ethereum co-founder Vitalik tweeted his support for the platform, but has dropped almost 20% over the past week from over $12 to nearly $9.70, and is off more than 90% since Jan. 1. SOL's decline has largely stemmed from Solana's ties to the collapses of the Terra ecosystem and crypto exchange FTX.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently jumped 0.21%.Equity indexes closed 2022's penultimate trading day on a high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 climbing 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively. The S&amp;P notched its biggest gains in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1%. Investors remain wary about China's retreat from Covid lockdown, which could jolt its stagnant economic growth but also raise global, energy prices.Security remains a key issue for the crypto industry. In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Thursday, Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at crypto sleuthing firm TRM Labs, said that cracking down on crypto hacks will require hardening cyber defenses. The former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor said that finding strategies to identify and trace illicit activity will mean developing better “blockchain intelligence tools” that can identify new mixers before bad actors can get to them.According to TRM Labs, more than $3.6 billion in funds have been drained in crypto this year. About 80%, or roughly $3 billion, targeted decentralized finance (DeFi)Earlier in the program, CoinDesk Indices Managing Director Andrew Baehr, said that although bitcoin's value declined about 64% year-to-date, CoinDesk research showed that BTC and ETH returns in 2022 per unit of risk were about the same as equities and significantly better than bonds.““We want to underscore this is not too different from what you would see in traditional markets, especially stock markets,"" Baehr said. ""Look at some of the darlings that people were really excited about 18 months ago in stocks, they’ve lost 80-90% of their value as well.”Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.9%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.8%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+2.6%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−2.9%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−2.8%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.1%Smart Contract PlatformInsightsFund Manager 3iQ Has 3 Bold Predictions for 2023By James RubinA year ago, before the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem, the implosion of Three Arrows Capital and crypto lending platform Celsius and disgrace of exchange giant FTX, who could have foreseen that the digital asset industry would be limping home in 2022. A year ago, bitcoin was still percolating over $47,000 and seemed likely to remain unruffled by the economic headwinds already buffeting the world.What's in store in 2023?In an interview with CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research for Canadian crypto asset manager, said he expects a price rebound in 2023 and TradFi companies and others to play a more active role not only in finding uses for blockchain technology but in the development of regulation. ""Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side,"" Connors said.CoinDesk: What's your first prediction for 2023?Connors: Leadership will come from the corporate side, not the regulatory side. We're looking for regulatory clarity so that investment firms can own coins and invest in existing Layer 1s. Whether whether it be bitcoin, Ethereum or Layer 1s, we believe the incentive structures of companies will make them take a leadership role and act and not wait for legislation to both continue to create their own industry blockchains as well as leverage the existing Ethereum EVM, and to a lesser degree, the bitcoin blockchain as they transfer both B2B and B2C functionality to blockchains. That was the most silent, underreported action in 2022. TradFi is going to lead the charge, not native crypto and not regulatory agencies. That's going to be the curveball.CoinDesk: What else do you foresee for the year ahead?Connors: 2023 will be a barbell for digital assets. It will be the core Layer 1s, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and it will be the use of NFTs by TradFi companies, which is a corollary to my first point. In 2022, the ecosystem was you had your alt level ones like Solana, Algorand and the like providing the bulk of the non-Bitcoin, Etherium, stablecoin market cap. Seventy percent of market cap in digital assets of the last 12 months. So that 30% of market cap is going to shift from alt level ones and level twos and other projects to be more NFT related. The NFT technology from a security and verification standpoint has greater integrity, and a higher trust and security factor. Given it can be nested with the Etherium ecosystem and can be bridged, it will have functionality and security. I think you'll see the most growth in NFTs.CoinDesk: What's going to happen to crypto prices? Do you see a rebound, and if so, when?Connors: We are so dollar based. Dollar strength destroys risk assets. The Fed has two mandates, price stability and full employment. But they have taken on a third mandate. They have a trilemma, which is wonderful because no economic system can run on two poles. My third prediction is that before the third quarter, the Fed will stop quantitative tightening. They will stop because the Treasury market would have experienced a failure like September 2019. Money markets will crack, the Fed will print and crypto will reverse as sharply as it did in March 2020. We're still young as a market. We don't conrol our own destiny on price and adoption.Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorShiba InuSHIB+2.5%CurrencyCosmosATOM+2.5%Smart Contract PlatformSolanaSOL+1.9%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.1%EntertainmentDecentralandMANA−3.0%EntertainmentAvalancheAVAX−2.5%Smart Contract PlatformImportant events.2:45 p.m. HKT/SGT(6:45 a.m. UTC): Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (Dec.)6 p.m. HKT/SGT(10 a.m. UTC): Baker Hughes U.S. Oil Rig Count CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Alameda Research Liquidates Ether-Based Holdings for Bitcoin; A Silver Lining in BTC and ETH Performance""First Mover"" dives into the day's top stories, including the sudden sale of several tokens held by Alameda Research worth some $1.7 million.

(NYSE:VZ) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/63-ownership-shares-verizon-communications-110014737.html,1672398014,STORY,['VZ'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Verizon Communications. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Verizon Communications?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Verizon Communications does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Verizon Communications' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Verizon Communications is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Verizon CommunicationsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Verizon Communications Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$29m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Verizon Communications. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

I'd like to welcome all of you to our conference call and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter revenues reached $25 million, 35% lower than comparable revenues last year. In September 2022, our SECaaS ARR was $6.9 million, same as June 2022. This was a challenging quarter for us and while these are the results we anticipated for the quarter, I am not pleased with them. As we look into the fourth quarter and into 2023, I definitely expect to see significant improvement and I remain optimistic on the fundamentals and the future. During today's call, I will discuss the challenges we are facing, the opportunities we see and why I am confident in the future. Before discussing in detail our different product lines, I would like to address some corporate news, I think, are important.Today, we issued a press release announcing our deal with Verizon business to provide network-based security to provide -- to Verizon SMB, Small and Medium Businesses and IoT, Internet of Thing customers. I believe this is the most significant SECaaS contract Allot has signed to-date, and I am very proud that the Allot has been chosen by Verizon to be the technology solution behind their intended security service. In another press release, which made public today, we announced that Allot Board of Directors has decided to nominate Cynthia Paul to serve as a Director on our Board, subject to shareholder approval. I am very pleased that Ms. Paul accepted our Board's nomination. Having known her over the last years, I believe our capabilities, vast experience and business expertise will greatly benefit Allot and I look forward to her joining our Board.I would like to also mention a couple of elements affecting us company-wide that I believe we should be aware of. One, as anticipated in our previous earnings call, in early September, we implemented some cost-cutting measures that also included reduction of our workforce. We intend to continue with the policy of tight control of our expenses in order to significantly reduce our loss in 2023 and reach profitability in 2024. Two, exchange rates have fluctuated significantly during this year. A significant part of our revenue is in non-U.S. dollars and the depreciation compared to the U.S. dollar had an impact on our revenues as well. Future fluctuations in exchange rates are, of course, hard to predict and may have impact on us going forward as well.And now I would like to move to discuss our different product lines. I would like to start by discussing our traffic management and analytics business addressed by our Allot Smart product line. The main use cases we see today in CSPs continue to be in traffic management, congestion management, quality of user experience, especially for video, policy and charging control and digital enforcement. As governments look to fight crime and terrorism, we see a growing interest globally and being able to block illegal activities such as drug trafficking, child phonography or terrorism. We are seeing growing interest in our products in this area as well. Many CSPs today are reexamining the composition of their network. This may be because they are moving to 5G or because they need to replace end-of-life products or other reasons.As they do so, we see multiple opportunities globally where CSPs currently using our competitor's product are considering a change. We are working closely with quite a few such CSPs to win their trust and business becoming their next choice for DPI. Most of these processes are through a competitive bidding process and some are potentially negotiated deals. In addition, we are working on expanding deals that we won before. We are also investing in new ways to help wireless operators manage congestions on their networks and save on their cost of expansions. I think we have developed some very interesting capabilities in this area with much value for wireless operators and I will be happy to share with you more details in the future as we progress and as we are prepared to make this public.In the previous earnings call, I discussed several sizable deals that we expected to book and be able to partially deliver in the second and third quarters and that were delayed. We did not lose any of them and we believe they will close during the coming months, but we cannot be assured of that. As I mentioned in the previous earnings call, given the delay in closing the deals and uncertainty regarding the exact time when we will close the deal and the exact terms required to recognize revenue, we cannot be assured that the revenues we expected from them in 2022 will be recognized this year. Looking at the DPI market in general, we see many opportunities and an overall solid DPI market. Many of the more significant opportunities we see are either new customers or competitor replacement opportunities.However, these opportunities are larger than average and make revenues more concentrated and lumpier. We see that it's taking us longer to close DPI deals than it took in the past. We continue to analyze the reasons for these delays. In part, this may be due to the larger size of the deals, it may also be related to the general economic environment and we do not know if this will be a continuing trend. I am fully aware of the challenges we are facing. However, it is becoming much clearer to me that our challenges are more on forecasting the timing rather than on the market size or our share of the market. We have a very strong pipeline of deals expected to close in the coming months. We are competing on or negotiating multiple large deals and forecasting their timing is challenging.I am convinced that the DPI market is solid and our competitive position is strong. I want to turn your attention now to what we see in our cybersecurity business and how the market is developing. As I have said in previous calls, Allot is transforming into a cybersecurity company and this is where we see most of our future growth coming from. We are engaged worldwide with CSPs that are looking to provide their customers with network-based SECaaS. As we look at the market, we see that the direction and momentum of operators interested to launch network-based security services continues to be very positive. The various operators provide services that are on par on speed, coverage and reliability. As they look for differentiation, network-based security is emerging as an important element.This is even more important since network security is a service native to the operator's network and is directly coupled to the access network itself. There are several Tier 1 operators who have reached the conclusion of providing network-based security to their customers is a significant and important to them, and they are discussing with us how to do so. As we announced earlier, we recently signed a SECaaS deal with Verizon. This deal is intended to place Allot network secure in the Verizon network and provide an embedded security solution that will include fixed wireless SMB customers and Internet of Things connections. As Verizon said in their quote, this offering paves the way for a network-based portfolio that will simplify their customer experience and help provide their customers peace of mind.Allot has been working with Verizon, both technically and commercially on this opportunity for quite a while. Our network secure platform is already -- has already been installed at Verizon Labs for quite some time and has been vigorously tested for several use cases. This contract is the most meaningful SECaaS contract Allot has signed to-date. I view Verizon's choice of Allot to provide cybersecurity protection for their SMB customers as a testimony to the strength of our solution and I am extremely proud to have been selected by Verizon. Allot was selected here to provide our solution only for a very specific subset of Verizon customers. We are, of course, hopeful that, perhaps, sometimes in the future, after we have proven ourselves in a practice, there may perhaps be opportunities to address some other segments with our offering, but we cannot be assured of that.In our previous call, I mentioned that we have signed deals with three awarded and in contract negotiation with the fourth. For sake of clarity, Verizon is this fourth operator. North America is the largest telecom market globally. Allot was traditionally much stronger in other regions and the advancements we are making with North American operators represent a significant change for Allot and will be key to generating SECaaS revenues in 2023 and beyond. While the Verizon deal is extremely important on its own, I am confident that other CSPs globally will consider Verizon's decision when they make their own decisions on providing network-based security to their customers. In addition, negotiations with several other operators in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC, we were awarded deals, but have not signed the contracts yet.These potential additional contracts represent the projected MAR of dozens of millions of dollars. On top of that, we are also in serious discussions with additional operators where we have not been awarded yet. Our main challenge today in our SECaaS business is to translate the contracts we signed into revenues. The first challenge is to launch the service. This process involves many stakeholders on the CSP side, technical, operational, marketing, purchasing and more. They all have multiple other tasks and priorities. Offering integration of our products with different internal IT systems is required. During the year, we increased our efforts to assist in those processes, and in some cases, we managed to help and expedite the process. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we unfortunately concluded that while in some cases, we managed to speed up things, overall, our ability to positively impact the launch date is very limited.As a result, we changed our approach and we will focus our future efforts of speeding up launches mainly on few targeted larger opportunities that we believe can contribute significantly to revenues. I will talk more about this and other changes we are making in our focus and how we run the business a bit differently. During the third quarter, no CSP launched a new SECaaS service with our technology. This is obviously disappointing. As of September 30, 2022, of the 25 signed customers, only 11 launched commercially. Most of them are relatively small operators and most of them launch the service only to a portion of their subscriber base. We do, however, expect one or two additional launches before the end of 2022. Our SECaaS revenues for the third quarter were $1.7 million and the ARR at the end of the third quarter was $6.9 million.While the number of subscribers grew during the third quarter, this revenue growth was offset by negative impact of currency exchange rates, leading to flat quarter-over-quarter SECaaS revenues and ARR. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued growth from existing customers and some modest revenues from new networks. Therefore, we expect SECaaS revenues to be higher. A major challenge we have is the marketing aggressiveness of the CSP when launching the SECaaS service. Aggressive go-to-market approaches can include among others, proactively offering the service in every customer interaction, bundling the security offering in the price plan for some or all of the customers, et cetera. The degree to which a CSP will be aggressive in their go-to-market approach is primarily determined by the perceived value of the service.Unfortunately, we have learned that merely adding revenues to the CSP is not a strong enough motivation. CSPs have multiple value-added services and these typically have low penetration rates, which CSP seem to be content with. If security is perceived as another value-added service, the expectations of it will be low, the targets given to the working level and the CSP will be low and the results will be low. This can also result in the CSP not prioritizing the launch of the service. On the other hand, when an operator sees security as presenting a strategic value, the motivation and results change. What is strategic will change from one operator to another and this can include elements such as, differentiation in the market compared to competitors or motivation to transition customers from 4G legacy service to a 5G service or overall brand perception of the operator as a quote, secure broadband provider, unquote, or motivation to transition the customer from a low tariff plan to a more expensive one and others.The willingness of the CSP to commit to an aggressive go-to-market approach and the contract is to a degree, an indication of how strategic this services to them. These discussions sometimes take time and further delay the launch, but I think they are important to our long-term success. Bringing all the above into account and in line with what we discussed in the previous earnings call, we changed certain elements of our approach to the market. One, going forward, we are shifting our focus from quote, land grab, unquote, for market share and number of CSPs to CSPs with revenue potential in the next couple of years. This means we will focus on CSPs that have a significant revenue potential even at the expense of market share. I can share with you that during the third quarter, we decided not to close with a certain CSP where we were awarded, because we felt the potential revenues were too small compared to the commitment we needed to make.Two, we will push very hard to have CSPs we engage with, contractually commit to an aggressive go-to-market. In fact, we are discussing today with multiple CSPs, including Tier 1s, the possibility of launching the security service as part of the regular price plans to a whole segment of customers, such as all premium plans, for example, in exchange for a lower sub price to Allot. As CSPs try to differentiate themselves and as they understand the importance of network-based security, we find some of them very receptive to the idea. If implemented, it will mean many more customers much faster without necessarily reducing the overall future revenue potential of that CSP to Allot. Of course, we will not always be able to get such a commitment, and we remain pragmatic as we may have to agree to a different approach depending on the CSP.Three, CSPs have medium size that will not commit to an aggressive go-to-market approach and small CSPs regardless of their planned go-to-market approach, our offer commercial terms where our revenues are not dependent on their marketing success. We expect some of these CSPs may agree to this and some will not. I expect these changes will have an impact also on the number of new CSPs we eventually sign up. However, it will allow us to focus our resources on the smaller number of CSPs that see more strategic value in the SECaaS service and it will ultimately drive our revenues. As I look at the deals we have done and those that are in the pipeline, I am convinced that the size of this market remains huge. While I am disappointed with the current pace at which our revenues are materializing, I remain very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term goals.In the previous call, I spoke about the challenge of integrating our HomeSecure router agent in specific routers and our efforts to simplify this process, and therefore, help expedite launches of HomeSecure solutions with CSPs. As part of this continuing effort, we announced recently that Allot has joined forces with Vantiva, formerly Technicolor to become part of their ecosystem and pre-integrate our solution on Vantiva Home and SOHO routers. I think this is an important step forward to make integration and launches easier for CSPs and we are pursuing additional steps to make such integrations even easier. Looking ahead, I want to summarize our expectations for 2022. For the remainder of the year, the SECaaS revenues and ARR are composed at this point almost entirely of the projected performance of the 11 networks we launched plus some projected revenue of new networks yet to be launched.We continue to forecast SECaaS revenues for the whole of 2022 to be approximately $7 million and our December 2022 ARR to be approximately $9 million, with the main risk being possible exchange rate changes and new launches. Despite the change in our approach to future SECaaS deals as I explained before, we expect to achieve approximately $180 million of new MAR in 2022. It is important to note that while MAR is a good indicator for long-term market opportunity, it is not a good predictor for short-term revenue. I would now like to say a few words on our expectation for the company's overall performance in 2022. We still expect the full year 2022 revenues of $125 million to $130 million, trending towards the lower end. Our forecast for support and maintenance revenues remains at $41 million to $43 million.As I stated, we have already implemented some cost-cutting measures, and as a result, we expect our OpEx for the year to be between $109 million and $111 million. We continue to expect our loss for the full year 2022 to be between $23 million and $24 million. Likewise, we believe our net cash reduction for the year will also be as previously guided between $35 million to $38 million. While 2023 guidance will be provided in our February 2023 earnings call, I do want to give you at this time a peek into the direction we are looking at. In 2023, we currently expect growth in both CapEx revenues and SECaaS revenues. We currently expect total revenue growth to be close to 10% compared to 2022. We remain committed to reach profitability for the full year 2024.This will be achieved by some revenue growth, mainly on SECaaS business, but also through tight expense control. Thus, we expect loss in 2023 to be significantly lower than in 2022. I believe we are on track to achieve this. I am fully aware of the challenges that we face. I believe our DPI business is solid and will continue as such. Our SECaaS business is where we see our significant future growth. While our SECaaS revenues are happening later than we would like and later than we expected, I remain convinced of the very large potential of this business and I am confident that we will grow very significantly in the coming years. I have full faith in our company, in our team and our products, and I believe the actions we are taking makes these goals achievable.And now, I would like to open the call for questions-and-answers, and Ziv and myself will be available to take your questions.

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,608Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Leading investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ranked #15 in terms of S&amp;P 500 components which bought back stock in Q3 2022 with stock repurchases of over $2.6 billion in the quarter.

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Q3 2022 Buybacks (Million): $2,804Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Given the higher oil and gas prices this year as a result of the Russia Ukraine war, analysts expect energy company ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)'s EPS to surge to $14.34 in 2022 from $5.95 in 2021. In terms of future EPS, analysts expect ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to earn $12.87 for 2023 and $10.95 in 2024. Given its strong earnings this year, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) bought back over $2.8 billion worth of its stock in the third quarter.13. Walmart Inc.

The episode then dives into why investors with long-term horizons might seriously consider buying proven large-cap stocks poised to grow within essential industries heading into 2023 amid all of the uncertainty, recession fears, and selling.Stocks rebounded on Thursday, driven by big gains from Tesla and many other beaten-down growth stocks. The buying comes after the Nasdaq closed at new lows on Wednesday. It is worth pointing out that the recent wave of heavy selling pushed many stocks to enticing technical levels.The jump on Thursday might have many praying for the arrival of a late Santa Claus rally. The one-day pop has the S&amp;P 500 closer to its 50-day moving average once again. But lingering inflation, higher interest rates, energy market disruptions, and supply chain setbacks have many economists and market participants fearful that the U.S. is headed for a recession in 2023.The market could fall again and remain volatile in the near term. The next major catalyst is likely to be the start of the fourth quarter earnings season in a few weeks when Wall Street will get updated 2023 guidance.All told, fading earnings and higher interest rates are a huge reason why stocks tumbled in 2022. But slowing earnings and higher rates are part of economic cycles. This is why investors thinking about five or 10 years from now don’t need to time the market. Instead, they should consider adding strong, proven stocks with solid balance sheets and great long-term outlooks amid the negative sentiment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM or TSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world with over 50% market share.

The company is also investing in manufacturing in the U.S. as tensions grow globally with China. TSMC currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on the back of its positive EPS revision. And investors should know that Taiwan Semiconductor’s falling stock price, mixed with its stellar fundamentals, encouraged Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to buy a large chunk of TSMC stock last month.Adobe ADBE is the champion of creative software with a portfolio that includes Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and many others.

ADBE’s falling price, coupled with its strong earnings outlook, has it trading near decade-long lows in terms of forward earnings.

(NYSE:DIS) was a long time coming. Iger had initially planned to step down as CEO back in 2015 after a decade in the top spot. However, he decided to delay retirement in order to lead Disney through a critical period of transformation, including the launch of its streaming platform, Disney+.Bob Chapek, Igers anointed successor, finally took the reins as CEO in February 2020. Unfortunately, his tenure was not a happy one, with many investors and analysts questioning his decisions and ability to lead Disney on his own. After a number of stumbles in 2022, Chapek was ousted as CEO. In his place, Disneys board has once again turned to Iger, who returned officially as CEO last month.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISPeter Lynch Chart of DISWhile Igers return has been met by many investors and analysts with some enthusiasm, the task of righting the Disney ship may not be so easy.Transition impossibleDespite retiring as CEO, Iger remained a powerful force at Disney, donning the mantle of executive chairman ostensibly to help make the companys long-delayed leadership transition as smooth as possible. This role was meant to be temporary, initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2020, but Disneys board extended Igers appointment another year in response to the far reaching disruptions that followed the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Igers tenure as executive chairman finally ended on Dec. 31, 2021.At the start of 2022, it appeared to many outside observers that the Iger era was finally over. With Iger no longer holding any official leadership role, Chapek seemed to at last be fully in charge at Disney. This appears not to have actually been the case. According to a host of reports in recent months, Chapek continued to struggle to exert his authority thanks to persistent meddling from Iger. A Dec. 21 report by Disney Fanatic, a website dedicated to tracking all aspects of Disneys business, highlighted the remarkable extent of Igers interference:Story continuesFrom secret meetings Iger conducted without Chapek to constantly micro-managing the former CEO, it appears as more Disney insiders share behind-the-scenes information that the former Disney CEO Bob Chapek was not only unsupported in his role by Bob Iger but might have even been actively hindered in performing his duties. Recent reports from The Wall Street Journal even indicate that Iger kept an office at The Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, even after he theoretically left the Walt Disney Company at the end of 2021. Iger is known to have held strategy-based meetings without Chapeks knowledge after Chapek succeeded him as Disneys CEO in February 2020. Though Iger handpicked Chapek to take his role as chief executive officer after nearly 15 years at the helm, he remained as executive chairman to help him find his footing but frequently undermined him.These reports are especially remarkable given that Chapek was hand-picked by Iger in the first place. Whatever Igers reasoning for choosing Chapek had been in 2019, he seems to have quickly revised his opinion of his successors abilities. Faced as he was with what was effectively a dual power structure within the company, Chapek in many ways appears to have been set up to fail.Return of the kingBefore Iger had even stepped down as executive chairman at the end of 2021, industry commentators were already talking about the possibility of his reclaiming the mantle of CEO from Chapek. An industry executive told CNBC as much in December 2021:It hasnt even been two years since Bob Chapek took over as Disneys CEO. But one executive told CNBC there are already internal wagers at Disney. Disney shares have stumbled this year, down nearly 20% year to date. Iger owns a lot of those shares. The board and Iger may get restless if Disney+ growth stagnates and the company continues to have turf tensions between executives.As Disneys stock continued to slump in the face of both media and economic headwinds over the course of 2022, calls for Igers return only intensified. On Nov. 21, Disney officially reappointed Iger as CEO for a two-year period. Disney Chairwoman Susan Arnold explained the reasoning for this decision at the time:""The Board has concluded that as Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the Company through this pivotal period.Disney investors are clearly hoping for a change of pace in the new year. However, it is unclear whether Iger can deliver on that expectation. After all, Iger has only been away for less than a year, and he appears to have continued his active involvement in the company since his official departure in Dec. 2021. Perhaps Disney will be able to turn things around more easily with the collapse of the dueling parallel power structures under Chapek and Iger back into a single hierarchy under Iger alone.My takeDespite its recent stumbles, Disney remains an impressive company in my view. It boasts an unbeatable portfolio of bankable intellectual property, as well as myriad physical and digital assets through which it can reach audiences of all ages worldwide. Under sound leadership, Disney should be more than capable of recovering the ground it has lost over the past couple of years.Iger is clearly capable of leading Disney effectively, but it is less clear whether he is as capable of selecting an equally effective successor. The bungled transition under Chapek will undoubtedly be on investors minds over the next two years as Iger searches for a new successor.Trade carefully!This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The stock is down over 40% and recently hit the lowest price since before the company released the Star Wars collection. The decline for the House of Mouse is where we find Sozzi's Take today. Sozz.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'll hit the high notes here. Our media reporter Allie Canal has been all over this Disney story. I would encourage you to just go read her work. It's absolutely awesome. But yes, the stock is really starting to come under pressure here. First up, as you noted, Brad, the stock is below the 2020 low, really not good there. I have my trademark Mickey Mouse ears on there. I'm probably holding an egg on my left hand. The stock of Disney down 46% year to date.And interesting here, Brad, is that shares of Disney are down 8.3% since Bob Iger's return was announced as CEO on November 20. Not what you-- you initially got that pop, but the stock has been losing ground ever since. So here's why I think you're seeing some of these declines here. We'll run through them very quickly. First up, no easy fixes for Disney. The view-- this view that initially caused that Bob Iger pop when it was announced that he would come in and fix everything overnight, and Disney would be back to re-accelerating earnings growth, that's just not reality. Disney is up against a lot of problems.Number two, what does future leadership look like? Bob Iger only signed on for two years. It's up to him to finally get the correct successor in place at this company. Three, what is the fate of ESPN? Allie was reporting a report, I believe, last week some whispers on Wall Street of a potential ESPN spinoff. That was from the team over at Wells Fargo. Interesting read there as well.Next up, how will a recession impact the parks performance? The parks business really has funded everything Disney has been doing the past year and a half in terms of streaming. But if there is a recession, best believe people are going to be pulling back and not spending thousands of dollars on a Disneyfication.Story continuesAnd then speaking of streaming here, you have to think, when have streaming losses have peaked? Have they peaked just yet? I believe the company lost $1.5 billion in their streaming business in the last quarter. It really shocked the hell out of investors. Next up, no blockbuster hits this year. See ""Avatar"" certainly ringing up its fair share at the box office, but missing expectations, I would argue.The dividend for Disney is still suspended. They suspended that during the pandemic. And how deep are the cost cuts here, Brad? That has been all eyes here on what Iger, on how deep, on how deep he cuts in terms-- how deep cuts on costs just to improve the company's bottom line. And speaking of Iger, my take here, it's time for some Iger magic out of the gate. Bob Iger, of course--[LAUGHS]BRAD SMITH: That's a good hat.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow. Of course Bob Iger knows his business very, very well. I think he's been spending the past few months since being announced really digging back into the business, re-familiarizing himself. I believe he recently traveled to the ABC newsroom on 1 Bureau. And now realistically, coming out of the gate next year, you're going to get more clarity on his plan. First and foremost, how much is he going to cut from this business in terms of cost?BRAD SMITH: One, I appreciated the Fantasia hat.BRIAN SOZZI: Me, too.BRAD SMITH: And number two, I think with everything that you laid out, I mean, it's spot on. Obviously, the huge issues that we've seen for right now, in terms of how they're forecasting and how they're modeling going into next year, is everything that has to do with pricing, whether it's pricing for streaming, whether it's pricing for the parks and resorts experience, and making sure that you're not turning any of those customers that have finally come back in to some of those folds, especially on the resorts side, given the low--BRIAN SOZZI: Ah, returning egg photo from our Cal-Maine discussion. There it is. That is the true star of this show. Cal-Maine, really big quarter for that company. But Brad, it was an interesting study-- oh, come on, guys. It was an interesting study. I got to put it out. People are going into debt to go to Disney. I mean, no, you cannot go into debt. You cannot put yourself $10,000 plus in debt to go to Disney. That's horrible.BRAD SMITH: I thought they had a timeshare package or system set up [INAUDIBLE].BRIAN SOZZI: It all sounds expensive to me, all of it, every single bit of it. Even that egg.BRAD SMITH: Well, the eggs are more expensive.]"
218,11aa46f0-7b9d-3ec0-ac5c-50dc15ebce3a,HP,2022-12-30,4 Stocks to Benefit from the Intensifying Global Energy Crisis,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-benefit-intensifying-global-180606202.html,1672337166,STORY,"['NG=F', 'NEX', 'HP', 'NINE']","[While energy prices have moderated significantly from their post-pandemic highs, there’s reason to believe that the crisis is far from over. A recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) has called this the “first truly global energy crisis.”That is because geopolitics is exacerbating problems in an industry already battered by the pandemic. For consumers, especially in lower-income groups that spend a larger percentage of their wages on energy, it is a double whammy. Because whether they received free money during the pandemic or not, they’re certainly having to pay back as prices of everything, from food to gas, and housing to automotive have gone up. And now, the Fed is doing everything it can to further increase the pain. Because things have to get worse before they get better.All their pain notwithstanding, this has been a windfall for American oil &amp; gas companies that are positioned to keep raising prices while limiting production. The energy crisis has after all been building up over the years as oil companies continued to cut capacity even before clean energy was produced in quantities sufficient to replace it. And investors have been in favor of limited capacity because we’re talking about high-maintenance equipment that significantly hurts profitability when demand falls back.But this year, the Biden administration had to release strategic reserves to bring prices down to sanity, so it was clear to all that some capacity increases were in order. And that is what we’re seeing now. It is likely to keep prices in the $70-$90 range possibly through most of 2023, which again will allow the government to replenish the strategic reserves. So whichever way we think about it, demand is not going away.Globally, things are also supportive. If Russia had been a smaller player in this market, the disruption would have been of less consequence. But because of its position as the leading oil supplier, and also a major supplier of gas (to Europe), this has become such a big thing. In response to the West’s sanctions and their attempt to put a cap on Russian oil prices, Russia has said that it will reduce production by 7%. We don’t know how long it can keep doing this because higher prices of course hurt its customers.Story continuesHowever, another factor will come into play in 2023. And that is China. The Asian country has been in shutdowns through most of this year. So even if the US slows down a bit, China could start humming. Which will mean stronger demand (and pricing power) for these stocks.Natural gas prices have fallen off a cliff, so there could be some moderate upside in that as well.The IEA recommends increased spending on clean energy, not oil, meaning that the current crisis should continue until fossil fuel use, which has increased as a result of economic growth, peaks and then enters a phase of steady decline.It predicts that “coal use falls back within the next few years, natural gas demand reaches a plateau by the end of the decade, and rising sales of electric vehicles (EVs) mean that oil demand levels off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly to mid-century.""However, in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050, clean energy investment needs to cross $4 trillion by 2030 while at the current levels, they can only get halfway there.Bottom line, demand for oil will remain strong for the next several years and we may as well make the most of it by making some intelligent investments. See what I picked today-Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. HPHelmerich &amp; Payne provides drilling services and solutions for oil exploration and production companies. It operates through three segments: North America Solutions, Offshore Gulf of Mexico and International Solutions.The company’s fourth quarter earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenue that beat by 6.8%.In the last 60 days, estimates for its fiscal year 2023 and 2024 (ending in September) were raised by a respective 74 cents (19.9%) and 60 cents (12.4%). Analysts currently expect the company to generate revenue growth of 45.4% and 10.2% and earnings growth of 4,360% and 22.0% in the two years, respectively. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock belongs to the Oil and Gas – Drilling industry (top 4% of Zacks-classified industries).Management is optimistic about “significant momentum heading into fiscal 2023.” There are three significant factors investors should be encouraged about.First of these is the Flexrig fleet that is making capital allocation more efficient. With this, there is minimal idle time for each rig because soon after a rig is released from one customer, it is re-contracted to another. This saves a lot in costs. Helmerich will also be reactivating 16 cold stacked rigs this year, for which it is entering into term contracts of at least 2 years. Roughly two-thirds of this is already committed with the majority going to large, publicly traded E&amp;Ps, mostly in the first half of the fiscal year.Second, rig pricing has been strong this year, which isn’t surprising given the energy crunch. But what’s particularly encouraging is that strong demand and term contract rollovers are expected to further raise average prices across the active fleet. Management is seeing significant momentum this fiscal year. Its technology products and automation solutions are clearly driving the strength in demand, since older rigs are not as effective any more.International expansion and returning wealth to shareholders are also management priority.NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEXNexTier Oilfield Solutions provides well completion and production services in active and other basins. The company operates through two segments, Completion Services, and Well Construction and Intervention Services.In the last quarter, NexTier beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5%. Revenue missed by 2.8%. Its 2023 earnings estimates have held steady in the last 60 days, but in the last 90 days they’ve increased 16 cents (7.8%). This represents earnings growth of 56.7% next year on revenue growth of 24.5%. The Zacks #1 ranked stock belongs to the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry (top 11%).Management has talked about structural advantages that the company is benefiting from. The non-availability of fracking fleets is one of the primary bottlenecks restricting U.S. land production growth. Although new builds are supposed to increase the existing fleet count of 270 by around 25%, the excessive pressure from high demand and supply chain constraints on legacy fleets that were not built for the modern fracking job will take many off production. Fleets will thus remain in short supply. E&amp;P companies are also keen on returning value to shareholders rather than building capacity.Therefore, at year-end 2023, U.S. demand (1 million bpd, according to industry consensus, quoted by management) will continue to outstrip supply (1.5 million bpd), even if there is a moderate recession, with the mismatch likely to stay for at least the next 18 months.While NexTier’s pricing will be higher in 2023, it will still be 10-15% off pre-pandemic levels. However, the company has taken advantage of the situation to renegotiate more advantageous commercial terms and locked in stronger partners. Meanwhile, its natural gas-powered equipment continues to fetch a better pricing because of the significant fuel cost advantage of natural gas. Therefore, these may be expected to remain active even in the event of a recession.Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. PTENPatterson provides onshore contract drilling services to oil and natural gas operators in the United States and internationally. It operates through three segments: Contract Drilling Services, Pressure Pumping Services and Directional Drilling ServicesThe company reported very strong results in the last quarter with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47.4% on sales that beat by 6.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 26 cents (13.5%) in the last 60 days and represents earnings growth of 302.9%. Revenue growth is also expected to be extremely strong next year at 30.3%. The Zacks Rank #1 stock belongs to the Oil and Gas – Drilling industry (top 4%)Strong results prompted management to increase the 2023 guidance for adjusted EBITDA and capex.A recent survey conducted as a part of their 2023 planning process revealed that across the broad cross-section of Patterson’s 70 customers, including the largest super majors, to public independence and small private operators, there was great optimism about adding rigs. They currently plan to add 40 drilling rigs in the fourth quarter and another 50 in 2023. This is a positive indicator of business growth next year.The company is taking advantage of the high demand for rigs to negotiate higher prices, while also increasing the number of rigs under term contracts, thus improving earnings visibility and increasing the prospects of steady cash flows. Its advanced gear, including a higher level of automation and lower emissions, is making it all possible.Nine Energy Service, Inc. NINENine Energy Service is an onshore completion services provider to North American basins and internationally. It offers cementing; completion tools, such as liner hangers and accessories, fracture isolation packers, frac sleeves, stage one prep tools, frac plugs, casing flotation tools, etc.; as well as other services.In the September quarter, its reported revenue was 8.6% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while earnings were 137.5% ahead. In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased by $1.15 (100.9%), representing a 301.8% increase in 2023 earnings. Analysts also expect solid revenue growth of 24.6%. The Zacks Rank #1 stock belongs to the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry (top 11%).The positive environment that the above players are seeing is also reflected in Nine’s results. Management stated that most of the upside versus its guidance in the last quarter was driven by cementing and coiled tubing price increases as well as higher volumes of completion tools. Equipment and labor shortages continue to limit availability, which is why customers are willing to pay a higher price. Cement price increases over the last couple of years is however partially on account of the shortage of raw cement.Nine holds a strong market share in the cementing and dissolvable plug segments. Its 20% share in cementing is helped by its innovative solutions in the face of raw material shortage and demand for lower emissions. Its dissolvable plug market share (it is one of four suppliers accounting for a 75% share) is secured by the high barriers to entry, as it involves advanced materials science that is not easy to replicate. This is also a fast-growing segment that management expects will grow 35% by the end of 2023.6-Month Price Performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Being a leading natural gas producer, Antero Resources is well-positioned to capitalize on the skyrocketing commodity price.In the prolific core Marcellus shale play, Antero Resources has roughly 1,542 undeveloped premium locations, depicting a bright production outlook. Also, in the core of the Utica play, the upstream player has roughly 925 premium undeveloped locations. Overall, AR has more than 20 years of premium core drilling inventory.Looking at financial strength, Antero Resources has a strong and sustainable balance sheet. AR is targeting a capital return program of 25-50% of free cash flow per year, beginning with the implementation of the share repurchase program. The company increased its share repurchase program by $1 billion to $2 billion, reflecting strong initiatives of returning capital to shareholders.AR expects to generate more than $2.5 billion of free cash flow in 2022 and more than $10 billion through 2022-2026. The metric suggests a significant improvement from the $849 million reported last year. This reflects the company’s strength in operations and makes it well-positioned to pay dividends, reduce debt and contribute to growth.The firm emits lower greenhouse gases than other major fossil fuel players. Antero Resources is prioritizing reducing debt. From 2019 through August 2022, the company managed to lower the absolute debt load by $2.2 billion.RisksAntero Resources’ lack of geographic diversification is concerning since its entire asset base is located in the Appalachian region. As such, it is more vulnerable to basin-specific delays and interruptions in production from wells, which can potentially hamper growth.Story continuesKey PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

220,d81dcd1c-50fe-362f-b500-148d4eb74bbd,NDAQ,2022-12-30,Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) shareholders have earned a 20% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-nasdaq-ndaq-shareholders-earned-141329229.html,1672323209,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 131% in five years. In contrast, the stock has fallen 8.2% in the last 30 days. This could be related to the soft market, with stocks down around 4.7% in the last month.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Nasdaq While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Nasdaq managed to grow its earnings per share at 35% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 18% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Nasdaq's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Nasdaq, it has a TSR of 151% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Nasdaq shares lost 12% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 24%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 20%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

221,8dec3aa5-ce2c-3f92-8e00-f24a36988824,CL,2022-12-30,Will Colgate's (CL) Growth Strategies Aid Amid Cost Woes?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgates-cl-growth-strategies-aid-132601089.html,1672320361,STORY,"['CL', 'IPAR', 'CLX']","[Colgate-Palmolive Company CL is well-poised on innovation, brand strength and digital capabilities. The company continues to gain from its stringent pricing actions and accelerated revenue growth management plans. Revenue growth management initiatives led to double-digit pricing gains worldwide in third-quarter 2022. This led to impressive organic sales growth in third-quarter 2022.Colgate’s third-quarter 2022 organic sales reflected gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives. Organic sales grew for the 15th successive quarter, with improvements in all divisions and categories. Innovation, brand strength and digital capabilities drove organic sales growth, with double-digit growth in oral care and pet nutrition in the third quarter.Colgate remains on track with its efforts to improve product availability through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels. However, the company is not immune to higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide, and unfavorable currency issues.Shares of Colgate have declined 6.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 5.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales suggests growth of 2.6% from the year-ago reported number, while earnings estimates indicate a decline of 7.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Working Well for CL?Innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years. The company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. It is also focused on the premiumization of its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations. Backed by premium innovation, products, including CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, have been performing well.Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, as well as the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company recently partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low. The long-term deal will bring together the world’s number one oral care brand and number one manufacturer of sonic toothbrushes under a co-brand, namely Philips Colgate. The product line will come with a variety of electric toothbrushes at different prices. The new brand will be available in limited countries in the said region.Expanding the availability of products through enhanced distribution to newer markets and channels is one of Colgate’s priorities to improve organic sales. The company is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. In 2019, the company expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. It remains impressed with the performance of professional skincare businesses — Elta MD and PCA Skin — in spas and dermatologists.The company expanded its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business. Colgate is witnessing strong market share gains in North America and China, its two largest markets, with increased share gains across all other regions.Management raised its organic sales guidance for 2022. The company anticipates net sales growth in the middle of the previously mentioned 1-4% rise. This includes a modest benefit from the Red Collar acquisition. Organic sales are expected to increase 6-7% compared with 5-7% growth mentioned earlier. Advertising investments are expected to be nearly flat year over year (on a dollar basis) on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022. Advertising, as a percentage of net sales, is expected to be down slightly for 2022, driven by reductions in Europe.The company expects a tax rate of 23.5-24% for 2022 on a GAAP and adjusted basis. It anticipates earnings growth in double-digits on a GAAP basis for 2022. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates the production of pet food for Red Collar to add 200 bps to net sales and be neutral to earnings per share.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeDespite sales growth, the company has been witnessing higher raw material and logistics costs worldwide, which dented the bottom-line performance in third-quarter 2022. Colgate’s Base Business (non-GAAP) earnings declined 9% year over year, while GAAP earnings were down 1%.Increases in raw and packaging material and logistic costs, as well as volatile currency, hurt Colgate’s third-quarter gross margin. Although the company expects to witness reduced impacts of logistic-related headwinds on a sequential basis, it expects logistic costs to increase year over year in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates the production of pet food for Red Collar to have a 100-bps negative impact on the gross margin. Colgate expects a gross margin decline on both GAAP and adjusted basis for 2022.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely, e.l.f.

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15.

(MU) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-attracting-140002845.html,1672322402,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -14.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has lost 11.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -127.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -147.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.86 points to a change of -122.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -297.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.57 indicates a change of +184.6% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -48.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -51.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.11 billion and $23.35 billion estimates indicate -47.6% and +44.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron.

Brands, Inc. YUM is likely to benefit from unit expansion, the strong performance of Taco Bell and digital initiatives. Also, the emphasis on the Dragontail platform bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges are a concern.Let us discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthYUM! Brands continues to focus on expansion efforts to drive growth. Considering its existing footprint of more than 50,000 restaurants worldwide, YUM! Brands believes it can nearly triple its current global presence over the long term. During the third quarter of 2022, the company opened 979 gross units. The company reported solid developments in the KFC and Pizza Hut International divisions, with gross unit openings of 485 and 392, respectively. The company reported solid developmental contributions from each brand in China, India, the Middle East, Thailand and Turkey. The company anticipates achieving a long-term unit growth of 4% to 5% in the upcoming periods.Taco Bell continues to impress investors with robust same-store sales. The company’s comps increased 5% and 8% during the first and the second quarter of 2022, respectively. The momentum continued in third-quarter 2022, with Taco Bell’s comps increasing 6% year over year. Taco Bell recorded 98 gross new restaurant openings in third-quarter 2022. The company announced that it is focused on building momentum in markets like the U.K., Spain and India.Yum! Brands implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all brand segments to enhance the guest experience. The company has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive. During third-quarter 2022, the company reported digital sales of approximately $6 billion (with the digital mix exceeding 40%). The company has been benefitting from the acquisition of Dragontail Systems. The initiative allows the company to tap the powers of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and improve its delivery capabilities. During the third quarter of 2022, the company initiated the rollout of Dragontail’s Smart kitchen management and driver tracking system. Backed by positive results in certain markets, the company intends to expand this cutting-edge platform across its franchisees in the United States.In the past three months, shares of the company have gained 21.6% compared with the industry’s 13.6% growth.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsThe company has been continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. Year to date (through the third quarter of 2022), the company’s restaurant margin came in at 23.9%, down 60 basis points from 24.5% reported in the prior-year quarter. The downside was primarily caused by commodity and wage inflation and partially offset by same-store sales growth. Net costs and expenses during the third quarter amounted to $1,094 million compared with $1,079 million reported in the prior-year quarter. We believe that costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives are likely to dent margins in the near term.Moreover, supply chain challenges remains a headwind. Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksYum! Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

""Double McPlant"" features two juicy Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) patties and has answered fans' calls for more vegan menu items.The fast food chain attributed the response to early trials and an increased appetite for plant-based products, with investors taking to the stock by bidding up shares of Beyond Meat.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with BYND. Click here to check it out. BYND 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BYNDPeter Lynch Chart of BYNDMcDonald's Partnership Can Only Do So Much for Beyond MeatBYND Data by GuruFocusIt's been a big year for Beyond Meat, though mostly not for positive reasons. The popular vegan ""fake meat"" company was forced to recall several of its products earlier this year, causing the stock to fall and public favor to wane. However, despite the rough start, Beyond Meat investors have taken heart thanks to the McDonald's news, an unprecedented milestone for the company and a huge leap forward for plant-based meat alternatives.However, Beyond Meat has deeper problems it needs to solve before I'm convinced. Though Beyond Meat seemed like a revolutionary company when it first rose to prominence, upon taking a step back and gaining some perspective, it's clear that it has some significant issues. Looking at Beyond Meat's financials, it is difficult to miss the red flags. The company has yet to become profitable, and it's uncertain if that situation will change anytime soon.Although it may have found success in the past, Beyond Meat has recently struggled to keep up with the competition. In addition, the current economic climate doesn't seem to be working in its favor; too many factors beyond the company's control could impact its future performance. Despite all of this, bulls still hold out hope for the future of this innovative startup, but those hopes might be misplaced until significant changes occur within Beyond Meat's business model and management structure.Story continuesWhy the McDonald's news is a temporary blipMcDonald's is rolling out yet another 'double' to the menu the Double McPlant. It took three years of meticulous testing and collaboration with Beyond Meat. Still, it was finally released in September 2021 and has proven popular enough for a sequel to be launched this January adding to the ever-growing list of Big Mac doubles.The news proved to be a short-term catalyst for Beyond Meat. However, it should not distract investors from the larger issues surrounding the company.Beyond Meat's stock was initially seen as a high-growth play when it went public in 2019, with the company subsequently enjoying rapid revenue growth of 275% that same year. However, these days the outlook is much more uncertain; the past quarter showed Beyond Meat's net revenue had dropped 23% to $82.5 million, which hints at a downtrend in consumer preferences and other current market conditions, making it difficult for the once-promising firm. Though early investors were expecting potentially outsized returns, this downturn presents an interesting new challenge for Beyond Meat moving forward as it navigates its way through such headwinds.The revenue stagnation that Beyond Meat has been experiencing is a massive issue for the younger, unprofitable company. With an operating loss of $89 million in the third quarter and a small moat in a highly competitive industry, it won't be easy to transition into profitability. It must begin to find ways to differentiate itself from the competition, or it might not be able to make up for the revenue losses. As one of the pioneers in this sector, the ball is in Beyond Meat's court; this company has the influence and capabilities to drive change. However, the issues it is facing are systemic.Narrow moat and intense competitionBeyond Meat has certainly had a meteoric rise to success, but it has an incredibly narrow economic moat. The market for meat alternatives is crowded with more than 60 rival brands, so it has very little in terms of long-term protection against competitors.Beyond Meat has not only been competing against the multitude of alternative meats on the market, but it is up against the more familiar, often more affordable and arguably more tasty conventional real meat. This challenge was recently highlighted by reports that plant-based beef can cost up to twice as much as regular beef. So, besides developing its product to level up with its competition, Beyond Meat must also seriously consider how to close this price gap and make its product more accessible to a wide range of consumers if it wants to stay afloat long-term. This is no small feat for sure, and it will largely determine how far alt-meat companies can go in their mission for replacing meat consumption.In other words, Beyond Meat is in a difficult bind. On the one hand, its prices are already uncompetitive with traditional meat, so it will continue to lose market share if it chooses to raise them. But if products remain at current prices, the company may be unable to remain financially viable due to high operational costs and current cash reserves. The company nearly burned $90 million in the third quarter alone and currently has limited cash and equivalents. To continue funding operations and business projects, Beyond Meat may need external capital from debt or equity markets, which won't bode well for investors down the line as it could limit their claim on earnings.TakeawayBeyond Meat investors no doubt welcomed recent news that McDonald's plans to start offering a new Double McPlant option. However, this will not alleviate the long-term issues facing the company. Whether it be cost savings initiatives or fresh marketing strategies, the company needs to find a way to get a moat to protect against competitors and get its costs under control.The bottom line is, Beyond Meat needs to focus on profitability and improve its competitive advantage so that positive momentum from good news can generate a stronger and more sustained stock rally.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Also, focus on strategic partnerships bode well. However, a decline in comps from pre-pandemic levels and inflationary pressures are a concern.Let’s discuss the factors highlighting why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Major Growth DriversMcDonald's has been focusing on digitalization to drive growth. The company is transforming its offerings across drive-thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in with digital enhancements. Despite reopening dining rooms, the company stated that drive-thru sales in its top six markets remain strong compared with pre-pandemic levels. The company noted that in its top six markets, digital sales were over one-third of the company’s system-wide sales in third-quarter 2022. During the quarter, digital sales came in at approximately $7 billion, reflecting a rise of 40% year over year.McDonald's continues to focus on the loyalty program to drive sales and average checks. It believes the program will help retain existing customers and expand the customer base. During third-quarter 2022, the company witnessed accelerated loyalty adoption in Germany. Also, it witnessed a rise in digital customer frequency in the United States (on a quarter-over-quarter basis) courtesy of the camp McDonald's promotion.To enhance the delivery experience, the company announced the integration of a new feature where customers can earn loyalty points for orders and pay for delivery within the McDonald's app. The initiative is currently being rolled out in the United States and is also available to customers in the U.K. The company plans to expand this capability to Canada and Australia by 2022-end. The company remains optimistic in this regard and anticipates the initiative to boost delivery sales in the upcoming periods. The company also has long-term strategic partnerships with UberEats, DoorDash, Just Eat Takeaway.com and Deliveroo for delivery purposes. These partnerships provide optimized operational efficiencies and seamless customer experience, paving a path for expanded delivery service offerings.Story continuesMcDonald’s believes that there is a huge opportunity to grow all its brands globally by expanding its presence in existing markets and entering new ones. Its expansion efforts continue to drive performance. Despite unfavorable scenario, the company continues to expand its global footprint. It is planning to open more than 1,800 restaurants globally in 2022, which includes 500 openings in the United States and international operated markets (IOM) segment and 1,300 (including nearly 800 in China) inaugurations in the international developmental licensed (IDL) market. The company expects restaurant growth of nearly 3.5% for 2022.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past six months, shares of the company have gained 7.4% compared with the industry’s 13.5% growth. The downside was mainly due to commodity and wage inflation, supply chain challenges and a challenging macro environment. Although overall comps have increased sharply, it is still far behind the pre-pandemic level in a few markets. In third-quarter 2022, comps in the China market were negative. Softening economy and COVID-related government restrictions have hurt comps in China. The company intends to monitor the situation regularly to gauge the impacts of COVID-19.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMcDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Supply-chain disruptions and higher fuel costs are likely to keep the bottom line of the companies in this industrial cohort under pressure.The industry has risen 11.7% over the past three months, compared with the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 5.9% appreciation and 12.6% growth of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Among the air freight and cargo players, United Parcel Service, Inc. and FedEx Corp. announced dividend hikes even during the coronavirus-induced uncertainty in 2021, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance. Dividend-paying stocks are hugely favored by investors, especially in uncertain times as the current one.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have strong fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.05%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 7.84%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the package delivery service had lost 8.5% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's loss of 3.4% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.4% in that time.United Parcel Service will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect United Parcel Service to post earnings of $3.59 per share. This would mark no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $28.1 billion, up 1.2% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.92 per share and revenue of $101.41 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.51% and +4.24%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Dividend-paying stocks are hugely favored by investors, especially in uncertain times as the current one.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have strong fundamentals. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesUPS: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, United Parcel provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services.

Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is a major positive and is leading to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities. Notably, UPS paid dividends worth $3,842 million and repurchased shares worth $2,194 million in the first nine months of 2022.

242,278ac2b1-5b0a-3d9f-9550-a892b4ac4447,MDLZ,2022-12-30,Returns On Capital At Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Have Stalled,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-mondelez-international-nasdaq-120039124.html,1672401639,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Mondelez International is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.087 = US$4.7b ÷ (US$68b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 8.7%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.8% average generated by the Food industry. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Mondelez International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Mondelez International here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Over the past five years, Mondelez International's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Mondelez International to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Mondelez International is paying out 51% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Mondelez International's ROCEIn summary, Mondelez International isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 73% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know more about Mondelez International, we've spotted   4 warning signs,  and 1 of them is significant.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Strength in such strategies is helping the company navigate complex supply chain challenges. These are also helping the company improve in-store fundamentals and stock performance for the brands. The company is implementing inflation-justified pricing actions across all businesses. The company is committed to increasing its focus and resources to reshape its portfolio and achieve sustainable growth across pet food and snacks, coffee and snacking categories. Management has been optimizing its supply chain, lowering discretionary costs and expanding network production efficiencies to streamline costs.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else is Driving Growth?The J. M. Smucker Company is benefiting from strength in the International and Away from Home divisions. This was witnessed in second-quarter fiscal 2023, with net sales advancing 14% to $297.9 million. Excluding divestitures and currency headwinds, net sales rose 19% for the Away from Home division, driven by double-digit growth for coffee and Uncrustables sandwiches. The segment’s profit climbed 3% to $41.5 million, mainly reflecting a favorable net impact of positive net price realization and higher commodity costs somewhat offset by lower contribution from volume/mix.Talking of the coffee business, the overall coffee portfolio looks encouraging as at-home coffee remains strong, despite inflationary pressures given consumers’ daily coffee habits. In the coffee category, net sales grew 10%, led by all brands in the market-leading at-home coffee portfolio during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s Café Bustelo and Folgers brands are doing well in the category.Story continuesWill Cost Hurdles be Countered?During second-quarter fiscal 2023, The J. M. Smucker’s gross profit dipped 1%. The lower gross profit was a result of higher commodity and ingredient, packaging, transportation and manufacturing costs, among other factors partly compensated by improved net price realization. The adjusted operating income fell 2% due to the reduced gross profit and higher selling, distribution and administrative (SD&amp;A) costs.On its quarterly earnings release, management stated that the ongoing cost inflation, a volatile supply chain and a broader macroeconomic landscape continue to affect the company’s results and cause risks for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, The J.M. Smucker remains focused on pricing actions to minimize the impacts of cost inflation. We note that the company is benefiting from positive net price realization, which was witnessed in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with higher net price realization contributing 17 percentage points to the top-line growth. During the quarter, net sales growth was mainly backed by positive net price realization in the company segments.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 23.7% in the past six months compared to the industry’s growth of 7.8%.3 Solid Food PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup CPB and Mondelez International, Inc.

The leading poultry producer’s strategic growth efforts, including capacity expansions, are worth noting. However, the company has been grappling with rising costs for a while.Let’s delve deeper.Solid Europe and U.S. OperationsDuring the third quarter of 2022, Pilgrim's Pride’s net sales in U.S. operations were $2,836.9 million, up from $2,466.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Its diversified U.S. portfolio across bird sizes and the Key Customers strategy supported its performance amid changing market conditions. Strength in the Case Ready and Small Bird businesses and momentum in the Prepared Foods business helped the company counter volatility in Big Bird Debone. It witnessed continued brand momentum in the U.S. retail, with Just Bare and Pilgrim’s prepared products increasing more than 45% year over year.Net sales from the U.K. and Europe operations rose to $1,203.1 million in the third quarter from $930.4 million in the prior year quarter. Despite a tough consumer environment and extensive cost escalation, the company’s U.K. and Europe businesses witnessed sequential profit growth via a continued focus on Key Customer partnerships and operational efficiencies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Driving Pilgrim’s Pride’s GrowthPilgrim’s Pride’s customer-centric approach propelled it to develop unique offerings that provide competitive advantages. The company’s focus on key customers is a pathway for refining its portfolio and creating competitive advantages over its peers. In this regard, management undertook several sessions to find ways to counter inflationary headwinds for key customers. Recently, the company announced efforts to optimize the manufacturing network.Taking into account Pilgrim's Pride’s focus on profitable growth and impressive market momentum, management had unveiled some new investments in the United States earlier. In this regard, management is investing in expanding the Athens, GA, facility to improve service levels and boost Key Customer growth. The company will undertake operational excellence improvements via automation throughout its U.S. footprint and construct a protein conversion plant for pet food ingredients in Georgia. In addition, Pilgrim's Pride will develop a Prepared Foods facility in the Southeast U.S. to support branded growth and diversify its portfolio. The company incurred capital expenditures of $146 million in the third quarter of 2022 on the earlier-announced organic growth investments and rebuilding of the hatchery in Mayfield, KY.Pilgrim's Pride has been steadily augmenting the marketing support of its brands as they expand and enter new regions. The company resorts to frequent supply chain improvements to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In this respect, it has been progressing with developing automation technology for its processing plants. Introducing such advanced technology is expected to increase efficiency and aid in combating labor availability issues.The company is on track with investing in the business to accelerate organic growth, mainly with key customers. It continues looking for M&amp;A opportunities to diversify its portfolio in segments and geographies. The company is progressing with embedding automation throughout the production units.Story continuesHurdles on the WayIn the third quarter of 2022, Pilgrim's Pride’s Mexico operations generated net sales of $429 million in the reported quarter, down from $430.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s Mexico business saw softness in overall sales and profitability due to seasonality and weakened market conditions. Its Mexico business was hurt by major inflation and slowing demand. Apart from this, issues with mortality in live operations led to the downside. The business witnessed a decline in volumes, prices and profitability.Pilgrim's Pride has been grappling with the increased cost of sales for a while. During the third quarter of 2022, Pilgrim's Pride’s cost of sales increased to $3,972 million from $3,455.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely keep driving Pilgrim's Pride’s growth story.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 2.7% in the past three months against the industry’s 1.8% decline.3 Solid Food PicksSome better-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Mondelez International, Inc.

Uncertainties and commodity price volatility are affecting the energy market, hurting the prospects for upstream and downstream businesses, thereby making the outlook for the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry gloomy.Among the companies in the industry that will probably survive the business challenges are ConocoPhillips COP, Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Cactus Inc. WHD.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry comprises companies mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses. The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States. The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites. Overall, the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and gas prices. The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets, generating stable fee-based revenues. The integrated energy players in the United States also have access to downstream operations wherein the transported oil volumes are converted to finished products, comprising gasoline, natural gas liquids and diesel, through refining activities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated IndustryInflationary Pressure: Broad inflationary pressures are making the broader market extremely volatile. This is because investors are concerned, following warnings from central banks, that interest rates are needed to be held at higher levels for a longer period. In turn, this has raised fears of a recession, spurring market volatility. This could hurt energy demand, which might hurt oil prices. Thus, upstream businesses of the integrated energy players are under pressure.Refining Business Under Pressure: Worries about recessions have also raised concerns about weak fuel demand. Since cashflows from refining activities are dependent on demand for end petroleum products, the integrated companies’ refining businesses might get hurt.Story continuesLow Dividend Yield: Over the past two years, the composite stocks belonging to the industry are consistently generating lower dividend yields than the composite stocks belonging to the energy sector.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #154, which places it in the bottom 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry has surpassed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 69.6% over this period against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 21.4% and the broader sector’s growth of 34%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 3.89X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.56X. It is, however, higher than the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.19X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.41X, as low as 3.33X, with a median of 5.71X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio4 US Integrated Oil Stocks Trying to Survive the Industry ChallengesCactus: Cactus has been aiding its clients in fast-tracking their well drilling and completion activities. The company has also been enabling lower operator emissions per barrel of production. Thus, there has been a significantly lower carbon intensity per well. Cactus carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and is likely to see earnings growth of 147.2% and 36.3% for 2022 and 2023, respectively.Price and Consensus: WHDConocoPhillips: Considering production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the world. It is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. ConocoPhillips, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is likely to see earnings growth of 134.4% for 2022.   You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Rising interest rates will aid top-line growth.However, mounting expenses and deteriorating asset quality make us apprehensive about the company’s growth prospects.Analysts also have a neutral stance toward the COF stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been unchanged over the past 30 days. Thus, Capital One currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, shares of COF have lost 38.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 32.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Looking at its fundamentals, Capital One’s revenues witnessed a five-year (2017-2021) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.8%, with the momentum continuing in the first nine months of 2022. Opportunistic buyouts over the years have been driving revenues.In 2021, COF acquired TripleTree, LLC, which is expected to enhance its investment banking capabilities. In 2019, it acquired KippsDeSanto and, thus, forayed into the merger and acquisitions (M&amp;As) market. The acquisitions of Beech Street Capital and GE's healthcare unit reflect Capital One’s revenue-diversifying efforts. Revenue prospects look encouraging on the back of the company’s solid credit card and online banking businesses, as well as decent loan demand. We expect total revenues to grow 10.9%, 1.9% and 3.7% for 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.Moreover, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, Capital One’s net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) are expected to witness improvements. Supported by solid consumer loan growth and higher rates, the company’s NII and NIM witnessed improvement in 2021 and the first nine months of 2022. Our estimates for NII reflect a CAGR of 5.5% by 2024. Further, we project NIM of 6.66%, 6.60% and 6.65% for 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.Apart from this, COF’s capital-deployment initiatives look encouraging. After slashing the quarterly dividend by 75% in 2020, Capital One restored the same to 40 cents per share in the first quarter of 2021. In July 2021, the company hiked the same by 50% to 60 cents per share and announced a special dividend of 60 cents per share. The company has a share repurchase plan in place. As of Sep 30, 2022, $5.3 billion worth of repurchase authorization was available.However, Capital One’s asset quality has been deteriorating. The provision for credit losses and net charge-offs (NCOs) have been steadily rising. Though provisions fell in 2018 and NCOs declined in 2018 and 2020, these witnessed a CAGR of 12.3% and 0.8%, respectively, over the five years ended 2020. In 2021, the company recorded a provision benefit and a decline in NCOs, reflecting an improving economic outlook. Nonetheless, provisions and NCOs rose in the first nine months of 2022 on worsening economic expectations.COF’s expenses witnessed a CAGR of 3.9% over the last five years (ended 2021), with the trend persisting in the first nine months of 2022. The increase was mainly due to a rise in marketing costs and inflationary pressure. Expense levels are expected to remain elevated, given the company’s continued investments in technology and infrastructure, as well as inorganic expansion efforts. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses suggest seeing a CAGR of 13.4% over the next three years.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are S&amp;T Bancorp STBA and Mid Penn Bancorp MPB.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Ulta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 70% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ULTABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ULTACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Ulta here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Ulta, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in ULTA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Ulta, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 7.8% over the past month to $22.87.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ulta. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Ulta may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

250,3f32b4c7-4bf0-3203-807c-965bb2895f61,NSC,2022-12-30,Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 72% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-corporation-nyse-nsc-130014072.html,1672405214,STORY,['NSC'],"[Every investor in Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Norfolk Southern, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norfolk Southern?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Norfolk Southern already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Norfolk Southern, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Norfolk Southern. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 5.6% of the stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Norfolk SouthernThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Norfolk Southern Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$58m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Norfolk Southern. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Norfolk Southern better, we need to consider many other factors.

Hence, a dividend-paying one is obviously much coveted. However, headwinds like high operating expenses and supply-chain disruptions continue to hurt NSC. Currently, NSC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Factors Favoring NSCDespite COVID-19-related woes, Norfolk Southern is committed to rewarding its shareholders. In 2020, the company returned $2,399 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends ($960 million) and share buybacks ($1,439 million). In 2021, the company rewarded its shareholders to the tune of $4,418 million, through dividends ($1,028 million) and share buybacks (3,390 million).In January 2022, the company announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend payout. This was the third dividend hike announced by NSC in a year’s time. During the first nine months of 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $881 million, up 15% year over year, and repurchased and retired common stock worth $2,284 million.The company’s strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In the first nine months of 2022, free cash flow was $2,142 million. The company expects current-year dividends in the 35-40% range of net income. Management expects to utilize the remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares.The strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase in excess of 13% in 2022 from 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main growth drivers.Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022.Story continuesKey RisksEscalating fuel costs pose a threat to Norfolk Southern’s bottom line. Oil price is moving north, primarily because of supply concerns stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At NSC, expenses on fuel surged 91% year over year in the first nine months of 2022, leading to a 18% rise in operating costs.High capex is also likely to play spoilsport. Management expects capex for 2022 in the $1.8-$1.9 billion band.Due to supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity overall volumes declined 2% year over year in the September quarter. Volumes declined in each of the first two quarters of 2022 as well.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation sector are Covenant Logistics CVLG and Teekay Tankers TNK.Covenant Logistics offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant. CVLG’s cost-control efforts are appreciated as well. CVLG currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings being revised 6.3% upward over the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teekay Tankers is being well-served by the increase in tanker rates. A gradual ramp-up in economic activities also bodes well. High fuel costs are, however, weighing on the bottom line.Teekay Tankers currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. TNK’s shares have soared 67.3% over the past six months.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President &amp; CFO, John Murphy, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$62.29 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$63.95). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 28% of John Murphy's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in Coca-Cola than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Coca-Cola better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. In total, Senior VP &amp; Chief Technical and Innovation Officer Nancy Quan dumped US$840k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Coca-Cola insiders own about US$1.8b worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?An insider sold Coca-Cola shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Coca-Cola. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

253,3f5bcc6e-e6e8-356f-a59e-9f571cfc383d,KO,2022-12-30,Returns On Capital At Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP) Have Hit The Brakes,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-coca-cola-europacific-101936131.html,1672395576,STORY,['KO'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.086 = €2.0b ÷ (€30b - €7.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has an ROCE of 8.6%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.4%. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners roceIn the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Coca-Cola Europacific Partners here  for free.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' ROCE Trend?There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. The company has consistently earned 8.6% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 56% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Since the stock has gained an impressive 83% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, click  5 Best Stocks To Buy For Deflation.The swift economic rebound from the Covid shock unleashed the biggest inflationary wave we have witnessed since the early 1980s, according to The New York Times. Central banks started hiking interest rates in the summer of 2021 in response. Lead nation was Brazil. Early in 2022, the Federal Reserve stepped in, starting a bandwagon effect: As soon as the Fed acts and the dollar gains, other nations either hike their interest rates or risk a sudden devaluation, which fuels inflation even more. The world hasn't witnessed monetary policy tightening on such a massive scale in recent decades as it is doing right now. The interest rate increases currently involve many more central banks, even though they are not as significant as those Paul Volcker, the Fed chief after 1979, pushed through.Additionally, Covid-era stimulus programs are being phased out in favor of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce deficits and reduce demand in the economy, adding to the disinflationary push. According to a Brookings Institution analysis, the so-called ""fiscal drag"" in the US will cause the economy to contract by more than 3.4 percent of GDP in the third quarter.Right now, deflation isn't on anybody's radar as everyone is concerned about inflation.  However, we already know that technological improvements in several areas are deflationary and a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence and robotics over the coming years may cause a huge decline in human labor demand. In the near-term central bank over-tightening is the real risk factor in terms of deflation. Central bank policies take effect with a delay and they may increase the interest rates longer than necessary and don't act in time to reduce them.In any case you will notice that several of the best stocks for deflation are also very good investments during inflationary and recessionary times.Story continuesBest Stocks To Buy For DeflationOur MethodologyWe selected defensive, cash-rich stocks with a strong history of paying dividends. These businesses are most likely to survive deflation and continue dividend payments, which is attractive for shareholders as deflation ultimately leads to high unemployment. The demand for the businesses selected for this list will remain robust despite an economic slowdown.We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2022 database of about 920 elite hedge funds.Best Stocks to Buy for Deflation11. Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q3, 2022: 14Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), a diversified financial service company, is one of the best Canadian stocks to buy and hold to fight deflation.

Analysts are bullish on the firm’s long-term prospects, with investment advisories like Desjardins, Canaccord, and Keefe Bruyette raising their price targets on the stock this December.In the fourth quarter, Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY)’s earnings increased further as diluted EPS rose 2% year over year to C$2.74.

Despite a cautious view on the macro-economic outlook that is likely to challenge EPS growth and ROE defensibility for the Canadian banks sector, Poonawala notes Royal Bank shares have outperformed year-to-date and the analyst believes this relative outperformance could continue as investors seek exposure to the bank's EPS and ROE ""defensibility and dependable execution.""10. Atmos Energy Corporation (NYSE:ATO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q3, 2022: 23Atmos Energy Corporation (NYSE:ATO) is a Texas-based natural gas distribution company that serves over 3 million customers.

Even so, some stock market experts say Keurig Dr Pepper’s (KDP) current valuation could make it a better short-term bet than either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.The Future of Finances: Gen Z &amp; How They Relate to MoneyFind: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000KDP’s stock currently trades near $36, which is down about 4% from the beginning of 2022. In the current market, that’s a decent performance. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 19% year-to-date and the Dow has fallen about 9%. But while Kuerig Dr. Pepper has performed well relative to the broader markets, it still lags behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, both of which have reported stock price gains in 2022.One reason some analysts have a bullish outlook on KDP — whose current incarnation formed in 2018 following the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group — is that its stock still has growth potential.Analysts Suggest Dr. Pepper Has Room For GrowthForbes puts KDP’s valuation at $40 a share, which represents a 10% upside from its current price. The company’s stock is trading at 19x forward expected earnings of $1.92 on a per-share and adjusted basis for 2023. That compares to an average of 20x over the past three years, implying that KDP’s stock “has some room for growth,” Forbes noted.Meanwhile, Seeking Alpha reported earlier this year that Keurig Dr Pepper trades at a “very clear discount” to beverage-industry peers such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch, Monster, Diageo and Constellation Brands. According to Seeking Alpha’s calculations at the time, KDP has a 15% peer-based analyst upside.KDP has also put in a solid financial performance of late.

His seemingly unmatched and consistent value-investing strategies have earned him the title of Oracle of Omaha.Many of his investing strategies are known, but there is one that is often overlooked yet incredibly important. It’s a lot more prevalent in the startup investing world — one customer can mean all the difference for a startup but not necessarily for public companies.What happened: Buffett is one of the best investors in the world, so there are many lessons to be learned. He loves Coke and decided long ago to invest in the Coca-Cola Co. That ended up being one of his best investments ever. Now, he is acquiring Apple Inc. stock and recently switched from a flip phone to an iPhone.So what strategy is this, and how does that relate to Buffett’s love for Coca-Cola? It’s called value-added investing, and the general idea behind it is that you should be investing in startups you use, are a customer of and can provide additional value to the company.For Buffett, one of his longest-held positions is Coca-Cola, which he has owned for over 34 years. He publicly supports the company and is said to drink as much as five cans of Coke a day.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterBuffett’s' firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. began buying shares of Apple in 2016 and is now the company’s second-largest shareholder, owning over 5% of the tech giant. Later in 2020, Buffett ditched his $20 flip phone for an iPhone and now also has an iPad. The idea likely wasn’t the need for a new phone but rather a statement to support Berkshire Hathaway’s largest investment.This idea can be an effective method of investing. In the public markets, investing in companies you use likely is more effective because if you like the company, the odds are that others will, too. But your individual purchase won’t move the needle more than likely.Story continuesIn startups, that certainly is not the case. Startups often rely on funding like venture capital (VC) to keep the company going until it can be profitable. The first customers can be expensive because the brand isn’t established, and people will be more hesitant to spend their money. But if you become a buyer and unofficial brand ambassador of a startup you like, that can mean all the difference.If you regularly buy a product from a startup for a few hundred dollars, then recommend it to a few friends and family, that might produce a few thousand dollars in profitable revenue for them because it didn’t cost them money in marketing. That could be the difference between follow-on funding, paying rent that month or just rolling forward the profits to get a few more customers. If you like the product, it’s likely others will, and this can strengthen your investment thesis in the startup.As of a few years ago, it wasn’t possible for everyday investors to invest in startups, but that’s not the case anymore. Now, anyone can go on sites like StartEngine and invest in top startups, including StartEngine itself. StartEngine makes money when you invest on the site, so if you invested in StartEngine and continued to invest in other startups on the site, you’re effectively using the same principles as Buffett by using and supporting your investments. Supporting these startup investments helps them and you share in the upside.Buffett isn’t the only investor using this approach. It’s popular among startup investors and there are entire firms dedicated to this type of investing. Many VCs will reach out to companies when they find a new product they like to try to invest in, and it has produced some wildly successful results. While some people can apply this to startups that sell to other businesses, most investors will be looking toward consumer-focused companies like Apple and Coke.MaxTracker is another startup raising on StartEngine. It makes money selling GPS trackers that are used through an app on your phone. They can help you can keep your kids, car, bike and other belongings safe, and every time you purchase one, it helps get the startup off the ground. The company is valued at under $10 million right now, so if it becomes a unicorn, or billion-dollar company, that could result in substantial gains.With all of these investments, it’s important to note they are speculative and illiquid so don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Still, startup investing can be a great way to diversify a portfolio or simply invest in a company you like.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.This Unexpected Economic Safe Haven Might Be Your Best Bet To Weather The Current StormGaming Skins Just Became A $50 Billion IndustryDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

(NYSE:MHK) share price up 12% in a single quarter. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. In that time the share price has delivered a rude shock to holders, who find themselves down 63% after a long stretch. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Looking back five years, both Mohawk Industries' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 26% per year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 18% compound annual share price fall. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Mohawk Industries' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Mohawk Industries shareholders did even worse, losing 44%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mohawk Industries better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Mohawk Industries  you should be aware of.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Ligand Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Incyte has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that LGND has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.LGND currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.54, while INCY has a forward P/E of 29.06. We also note that LGND has a PEG ratio of 0.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. INCY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.30.Another notable valuation metric for LGND is its P/B ratio of 1.37. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, INCY has a P/B of 4.18.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to LGND's Value grade of B and INCY's Value grade of C.LGND has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than INCY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that LGND is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 7.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Intuit due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Intuit’s Q1 Earnings and Sales Beat on ExpectationsIntuit reported fiscal first-quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share. The bottom line surged 8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.53 per share.Revenues of $2.60 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $2.50 billion and surged 29% year over year.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues grew 38% year over year to $2 billion. This rise was driven by the solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online, a favorable mix-shift and the addition of Mailchimp.Total Online Ecosystem revenues grew 60% year over year to $1.3 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenues were up 29% year over year to $668 million, mainly driven by the mix-shift, higher pricing and customer growth.Online Services revenues which include payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, soared 109% year over year to $681 million. This was driven by strong performances of the QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments solutions, along with revenues from the new Mailchimp business.Within QuickBooks Online payroll, a mix-shift to INTU’s full-service offering and the continued uptick in the customer base acted as tailwinds. Within QuickBooks Online payments, an increase in the charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth drove revenues. Mailchimp contributed $264 million to total Online Services.Total international Online Ecosystem revenues increased a whopping 172% year over year on a constant-currency basis and 19% on an organic basis, excluding contributions from Mailchimp.Story continuesTotal Desktop ecosystem revenues grew 6.9% year over year during the reported quarter to $639 million.In the fiscal first quarter, revenues from Consumer Group increased to $150 million from $120 million reported a year ago, mainly driven by a strong peak in new customers and extension filers in October. However, ProConnect Group's professional tax revenues increased to $34 million from $26 million in the year-ago quarter.The Credit Karma business contributed $425 million to Intuit’s first-quarter total revenues, up from $418 million in the year-ago quarter. The robust year-over-year growth reflects high levels of monthly active users and revenues per monthly active user. It reflects strength in credit cards offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans.Intuit’s non-GAAP operating income climbed 19% to $662 million.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Oct 31, 2022, Intuit’s cash and investments were $2.72 billion compared with $3.28 billion as of Jul 31, 2022.The company exited the fiscal first-quarter with long-term debt of $6.49 billion, up from the previous quarter’s $6.42 billion.During first-quarter fiscal 2023, Intuit generated operating cash flow worth $328 million.Intuit repurchased stocks worth $519 million during the fiscal first-quarter and had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of $3 billion at the end of the quarter. INTU announced that its board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share payable on Jan 18, 2023. The newly approved cash dividend represents a year-over-year increase of 15%.OutlookIntuit projects fiscal 2023 revenues in the band of $14.035-$14.250 billion, indicating 10-12% growth.The company anticipates non-GAAP operating income between $5.258 billion and $5.363 billion, indicating approximate year-over-year growth of 17-19%.Intuit’s fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share forecast stands between $13.59 and $13.89, suggesting  year-over-year increase of 15-17%.For the fiscal second quarter, INTU expects revenues to grow between 8% and 9% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings for the quarter are estimated in the range of $1.41-$1.45 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -65.66% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Intuit has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

263,bbe815da-a178-33fa-9879-6643a8cbb246,WHR,2022-12-30,Can Whirlpool's (WHR) Pricing Actions Aid Inflation Woes?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whirlpools-whr-pricing-actions-aid-143302184.html,1672324382,STORY,"['WHR', 'HGV', 'RICK', 'H']","[Whirlpool Corporation WHR has been affected by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The company has been witnessing muted consumer sentiments stemming from inflation and increasing interest rates, along with the ongoing war in Ukraine and unfavorable currency.The abovementioned headwinds led to drab third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. Adjusted earnings of $4.49 per share declined 32.8% from $6.68 in the year-ago quarter. Net sales of $4,784 million dropped 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $4,957 million, down 9.7% year over year. Lower volumes stemming from weak demand hurt sales, which were partly offset by a favorable product price/mix.Whirlpool has also been witnessing pressures related to global supply-chain disruptions and rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, as well as energy costs. All these factors marred the company’s margin performance across most regions in the third quarter of 2022.Whirlpool generated a gross profit of $680 million, down 38.6% from the $1,108 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBIT of $265 million declined 56.4% from $608 million in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBIT margin of 5.5% contracted 560 bps year over year.It also noted that inflation is likely to remain high. Management expects cost inflation to persist throughout the first half of 2023 and expects raw material inflation to hurt its margin by 750 bps in 2022.For 2022, Whirlpool envisions a net sales decline of 9% to $20.1 billion, which compares unfavorably with the earlier stated $20.7 billion. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share (EPS) to be $5, down from the $9.50-$11.50 band mentioned earlier. On an ongoing basis, the metric is likely to be $19, down from the prior-stated $22-$24 band.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsequently, shares of WHR have risen 3.8% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10%.Efforts to Counter HurdlesWhirlpool is on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. It has implemented cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing a raw material deflation opportunity, effectively managing working capital and syncing the supply chain and labor levels with demand.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced significant cost-based price increases of 5% to 18% in various countries worldwide. The price/mix aided the EBIT margin by 550 bps in the third quarter, led by the execution of pricing actions announced in 2021.The company remains on track with its long-term targets, with profitable growth of 5-6% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 11%-12%. WHR also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023.ConclusionAll said, we believe that Whirlpool’s productivity and pricing actions are likely to help offset ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. Further, a VGM Score of B reflects its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, RCI Hospitality Holdings RICK and Hyatt Hotels H.Hilton Grand Vacations currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). HGV has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.7%, on average.

Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since February 2022 and COVID-related updates from China have also played a significant role in increasing global uncertainty and escalating recession-related concerns. All these adverse developments have resulted in the leading market indices like the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index posting a year-to-date (YTD) decline of 19.3%, 8.6%, and 32.9%, respectively.Under such circumstances, the famous phrase “cash is king” comes into play often. This means that during uncertain macroeconomic times, cash becomes more valuable than any other form of investment as it provides strength to the balance sheet and acts as a safety net. Popular companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are considered among the best cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds. These companies have also used their cash balances strategically to acquire assets at attractive prices, which has helped these corporations combat the market downturn more aggressively.10 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have shortlisted stocks with strong cash reserves as of Q3 2022 and have ranked them according to the hedge fund sentiment.

Dan Ives at Wedbush was impressed by the presentation and thinks that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has taken a bullish stance on the overall demand for EVs and its battery production targets.

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) anticipates its top line to compound annually by 12% between the 2023 - 2025 period to reach the $225 billion milestone.The EV segment is expected to contribute $50 billion to the top line by 2025. In August 2022, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) restored its quarterly dividend after suspending it at the start of the pandemic and also increased its share buyback plan from $3.3 billion to $5 billion.Here's what Chartwell Investment Partners said about General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The three worst-performing stocks in the Dividend Equity accounts includes General Motors (NYSE:GM, 2.4%), down 27.4%. GM posted solid first-quarter earnings, but, supply issues continue to be a headwind and the market appears to be “pricing-in” at least a mild recession. The question seems to be: by the time the supply constraints are resolved, will we be in a much-worse economic scenario that will “hit” the demand side?After a couple quarters of higher-than-average trading, Q2 was extremely light in both the Growth &amp; Balanced and Dividend Equity accounts (see below). After trimming GM earlier in the year at much higher price levels, we added back to the position. Now trading at $32 per share, GM’s P/E multiple on 2022 earnings estimates is below 5 times its annual earnings per share, which we think is very attractive and is already pricing-in at least a mild recession.”8. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Latest Cash and Short-Term Investments: $36.13 billionPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical company.Experts believe Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has built up its cash position due to the tailwinds from the COVID-19 vaccine. The company is now using the cash balance intelligently to acquire companies that integrate with its operations to create synergies and also expand its offerings. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced the acquisition of New Haven, Connecticut-based Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for a sum of $11.6 billion in May 2022. Following that, the company announced the takeover of San Francisco, California-based Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) for $5.4 billion.On December 13, Chris Shibutani at Goldman Sachs upgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and increased the target price from $47 to $60. The analyst highlighted the positive pipeline of products that are expected to outperform estimates following their commercial launch in 2023. This can drive significant value to the base business of the company. These developments have also reduced Pfizer Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) reliance on the prolonged outperformance of COVID-19 vaccines.Here's what Diamond Hill Capital said about Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”7.

Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since February 2022 and COVID-related updates from China have also played a significant role in increasing global uncertainty and escalating recession-related concerns. All these adverse developments have resulted in the leading market indices like the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index posting a year-to-date (YTD) decline of 19.3%, 8.6%, and 32.9%, respectively.Under such circumstances, the famous phrase “cash is king” comes into play often. This means that during uncertain macroeconomic times, cash becomes more valuable than any other form of investment as it provides strength to the balance sheet and acts as a safety net. Popular companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are considered among the best cash-rich stocks to buy according to hedge funds. These companies have also used their cash balances strategically to acquire assets at attractive prices, which has helped these corporations combat the market downturn more aggressively.10 Cash-Rich Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashOur MethodologyIn this article, we have shortlisted stocks with strong cash reserves as of Q3 2022 and have ranked them according to the hedge fund sentiment.

(NYSE:EL) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-est-e-lauder-120013640.html,1672401613,STORY,['EL'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.88bUS$2.47bUS$3.03bUS$3.72bUS$4.04bUS$4.28bUS$4.48bUS$4.66bUS$4.81bUS$4.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.92%Est @ 4.74%Est @ 3.91%Est @ 3.33%Est @ 2.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$90bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$90b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$43bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$68b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$250, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.009. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Estée Lauder CompaniesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Personal Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, click  5 Best Stocks To Buy For Deflation.The swift economic rebound from the Covid shock unleashed the biggest inflationary wave we have witnessed since the early 1980s, according to The New York Times. Central banks started hiking interest rates in the summer of 2021 in response. Lead nation was Brazil. Early in 2022, the Federal Reserve stepped in, starting a bandwagon effect: As soon as the Fed acts and the dollar gains, other nations either hike their interest rates or risk a sudden devaluation, which fuels inflation even more. The world hasn't witnessed monetary policy tightening on such a massive scale in recent decades as it is doing right now. The interest rate increases currently involve many more central banks, even though they are not as significant as those Paul Volcker, the Fed chief after 1979, pushed through.Additionally, Covid-era stimulus programs are being phased out in favor of policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce deficits and reduce demand in the economy, adding to the disinflationary push. According to a Brookings Institution analysis, the so-called ""fiscal drag"" in the US will cause the economy to contract by more than 3.4 percent of GDP in the third quarter.Right now, deflation isn't on anybody's radar as everyone is concerned about inflation.  However, we already know that technological improvements in several areas are deflationary and a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence and robotics over the coming years may cause a huge decline in human labor demand. In the near-term central bank over-tightening is the real risk factor in terms of deflation. Central bank policies take effect with a delay and they may increase the interest rates longer than necessary and don't act in time to reduce them.In any case you will notice that several of the best stocks for deflation are also very good investments during inflationary and recessionary times.Story continuesBest Stocks To Buy For DeflationOur MethodologyWe selected defensive, cash-rich stocks with a strong history of paying dividends.

If you want to see more companies that are buying back stock, go directly to 5 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock.Stock buybacks and dividends are the two main ways companies return excess capital back to shareholders.Unlike dividends which many companies pay quarterly, stock buybacks can be more flexible. If a stock's valuation is too high or if the macroeconomic environment is too uncertain, a company's management can decide not to buy back as many shares. If a stock's valuation is too low or if management is very confident on future earnings, a company could buy back more stock than it usually does.Given the wide discretion on the timing of stock buybacks, companies can cut their stock buybacks and not upset their investors as much as if they cut their regular dividends.If a company maintains its existing level of profitability and doesn't issue any new stock shares, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share in the long term. If earnings per share increases substantially, the company's stock price could potentially benefit if its valuation multiple stays the same.Stock buybacks are also more tax advantageous than dividends for the investors who have to pay taxes on dividends. The Washington Post explains, ""Buybacks are far more tax efficient for companies since dividends are taxed twice -- once as corporate income and again as dividends. Buybacks are only taxed once. Taxes on buybacks would have to increase dramatically — perhaps to about 10% — before it made sense for a company to declare a dividend instead.""Although stock buybacks are tax advantageous, the tax treatment on stock buybacks will change in 2023 given the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the new law, there will be a 1% tax on the market value of net shares repurchased beginning next year. As a result of the new tax, analysts estimate some companies might pay more dividends as a result and not buy back as many shares as they would have.Story continuesNevertheless, it is still expected that many companies will continue to use buybacks as a way to return excess capital back to shareholders.While stock buybacks have their upsides, stock buybacks also have their drawbacks. If management buys back shares at too high of a price for the company, for example, stock buybacks could potentially destroy value rather than add value. Investors, in that case, would have been better off if management had kept the money on the balance sheet or if management had returned the excess capital with a dividend. If a company isn't profitable, stock buybacks won't help EPS either.For those of you interested, check out 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.2022Given the potential for a recession next year, some companies are buying back less of their stock to strengthen their balance sheets.Given the 1% tax on stock buybacks next year, other companies are buying back more stock in 2022 before the tax goes into effect.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, however, total S&amp;P 500 buybacks in Q3 decreased 4% year over year to $210.8 billion.Companies That Are Buying Back Their StockRawpixel / shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of companies that are buying back stock, we picked the top 15 companies that bought back shares in the S&amp;P 500 in Q3 2022 according to the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and we ranked them by their stock buybacks in the quarter.15 Companies That Are Buying Back Their Stock15.

This comes as Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated in the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, “It will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.”Given the increasing borrowing costs, the profit margins of many REITs are expected to shrink further, resulting in potential dividend cuts.SL Green RealtySL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is New York City’s largest office landlord, owning and operating 33.6 million square feet across 62 commercial buildings. The office REIT currently pays $3.25 in dividends annually — divided into equal monthly installments — yielding 9.6% on the current price.But don’t be tempted by the impressive dividend yield. SL Green Realty has been pummeled by the declining demand and occupancy of office properties amid the rising popularity of remote work culture. The REIT reduced its dividend per share by 12.9% to $0.3108 for December, as it expects its operating cash flows and funds available for distribution to decline next year.SL Green Realty stock was also recently downgraded by BMO Capital Markets analyst John Kim as well as Scotiabank analyst Nicholas Yulico. After the office REIT slashed its monthly dividend on Dec. 5, Kim downgraded the stock to Market Perform from Outperform, while Yulico downgraded it to Sector Underperform.Many analysts expect the company’s loss margins to widen next year as the rising interest rates tighten spreads. SL Green Realty might incorporate further dividend cuts next year.Story continuesDouglas EmmettDouglas Emmett Inc. (NYSE: DEI) is a residential REIT that owns and operates more than 4,600 apartment units in Los Angeles and Honolulu. It also has ownership interests in office spaces in the submarket regions of the two cities.The REIT pays $0.76 in dividends annually, translating to a 4.75% yield. It slashed its dividend payouts by over 32% quarter over quarter from $0.28 to $0.19 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter.With Douglas Emmett’s growth prospects over the next year being bleak at best as the Fed maintains its hawkish stance, several dividend cuts could be on the horizon. Shares of Douglas Emmett hit 52-week lows on Dec. 7.AGNC InvestmentAGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AGNC) is one of the most prominent agency-backed mortgage REITs (mREITs) in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, the REIT has been hard hit by the rate hikes, as its shares fell by nearly 30% year to date.AGNC Investment’s latest financials reflect a substantial downturn, as the market headwinds linger.“Broad-based weakness in the financial markets, and fixed income markets in particular, continued in the third quarter of 2022 as global macroeconomic and monetary policy uncertainty intensified,"" AGNC Investment President and CEO Peter Federico said. “This dynamic contributed to the underperformance of agency MBS [mortgage-backed securities] in the third quarter.”In the fiscal third quarter that ended Sept. 30, the REIT’s tangible book value per share stood at $9.08, a 20.6% decline from the prior quarter. Its comprehensive net loss amounted to $2.01 per share, while economic return came in at negative 17.4%.Though AGNC’s bottom line is expected to improve in this quarter, the number is expected to be significantly lower compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021. The REIT might slash its dividend payouts in the upcoming months as its profit margins dwindle. It currently pays $1.44 in dividends annually, yielding 13.47%. AGNC Investment has a poor payout history, as its dividend payouts have declined at a 10.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past three years.Office Income PropertiesOffice Properties Income Trust (NASDAQ: OPI) owns and leases commercial office properties primarily to investment-grade rated single tenants. The commercial REIT pays $2.20 in dividends annually, yielding an impressive 15.9% on the current stock price.But the high dividend yield percentage might be a yield trap, given its unfavorable financials. Over the past five years, the REIT’s dividend payouts have declined at a 20.4% CAGR. Shares of Office Income Properties have plunged by over 44% over the past year.

It signed 108 office leases for its Manhattan office portfolio spanning 1,940,043 square feet during the nine months that ended Sep 30, 2022. This is likely to boost SLG’s occupancy levels and rental revenues in the upcoming period. More so, office-space demand in the upcoming period is likely to be driven by de-densification to allow higher square footage per office worker and the need for high-quality, well-amenetized office properties. This is expected to boost the demand for SLG’s high-quality portfolio of office assets with top-notch amenities at recently-developed office buildings in the forthcoming quarters.In December 2022, SL Green, in association with Michelin-starred Chef Daniel Boulud, announced two new food and beverage concepts at One Madison Avenue, its newest office development.Its diversified tenant base with a strong credit profile lowers the risk associated with dependency on single-industry tenants and assures stable rental revenues for the company.SL Green follows an opportunistic investment policy to enhance its overall portfolio quality. Through this, it divests the mature and non-core assets and utilizes the proceeds to fund development projects and share buybacks. Such efforts augur well for its long-term growth and relieve its balance-sheet pressure.SL Green robust balance-sheet position with ample financial flexibility poises it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It exited the third quarter of 2022 with $1 billion of liquidity.  Moreover, its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio has been steady over the recent quarters, indicating decent cash flow availability for near-term debt repayment and other fixed charges.However, a rise in the supply of office properties in SL Green’s markets and intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants, limits SLG’s ability to increase rents and/or backfill tenant move-outs and vacancies.A majority of SL Green’s operations is concentrated in midtown Manhattan, NY. Consequently, its concentration of assets in this particular geographic region makes it susceptible to the economic conditions prevailing in New York City.Rising interest rates are likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting SLG’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 17.8% in the past three months against its industry’s growth of 2.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Terreno Realty TRNO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the tailwinds surrounding the stock.Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 7.19% upward over the past 60 days. The favorable estimate revision reflect the confidence of brokers in the stock.Given the wealth of information at brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because the path of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to ascertaining the stock price.Positive Earnings Surprise History: AAL has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters. The average beat is 8.62%.Solid Rank &amp; VGM Score: AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bullish Industry Rank: The industry to which American Airlines belongs currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 37 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the industry in the top 15% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.In fact, a mediocre stock in a healthy group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a poor industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into account becomes necessary.Other Tailwinds:  Continued recovery in air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, bodes well for American Airlines.  Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the fourth-quarter 2019 levels. Total revenues per available seat miles is expected to be 18-20% higher than the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.Story continuesWith air-travel demand having improved, American Airlines is constantly looking to add routes and broaden network. The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025 end. As of September 30, the carrier reduced its debt levels by $5.6 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.Other Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider the following stocks:Covenant Logistics CVLG: CVLG offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant. CVLG’s cost-control efforts are appreciated as well. CVLG currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings being revised 6.3% upward over the past 60 days.Teekay Tankers TNK: TNK is being well-served by the increase in tanker rates. A gradual ramp-up in economic activities also bodes well. High fuel costs are, however, weighing on the bottom line.Teekay Tankers currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. TNK’s shares have soared 67.3% over the past six months.

Even so, some stock market experts say Keurig Dr Pepper’s (KDP) current valuation could make it a better short-term bet than either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo.The Future of Finances: Gen Z &amp; How They Relate to MoneyFind: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000KDP’s stock currently trades near $36, which is down about 4% from the beginning of 2022. In the current market, that’s a decent performance. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 19% year-to-date and the Dow has fallen about 9%. But while Kuerig Dr. Pepper has performed well relative to the broader markets, it still lags behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, both of which have reported stock price gains in 2022.One reason some analysts have a bullish outlook on KDP — whose current incarnation formed in 2018 following the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group — is that its stock still has growth potential.Analysts Suggest Dr. Pepper Has Room For GrowthForbes puts KDP’s valuation at $40 a share, which represents a 10% upside from its current price. The company’s stock is trading at 19x forward expected earnings of $1.92 on a per-share and adjusted basis for 2023. That compares to an average of 20x over the past three years, implying that KDP’s stock “has some room for growth,” Forbes noted.Meanwhile, Seeking Alpha reported earlier this year that Keurig Dr Pepper trades at a “very clear discount” to beverage-industry peers such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch, Monster, Diageo and Constellation Brands. According to Seeking Alpha’s calculations at the time, KDP has a 15% peer-based analyst upside.KDP has also put in a solid financial performance of late. It didn’t see “any significant” sales impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, Forbes noted, and that momentum has carried over into this year. For the first nine months of 2022, Keurig Dr Pepper logged a 10.4% year-over-year gain in sales.Story continuesThe company’s operating margin climbed to 26% in 2021 from 21.3% in 2019, before the pandemic. However, inflation has cut into KDP’s margins this year, with its operating margin dipping to 16.8% over the last 12 months.Dr. Pepper Gaining Market ShareIn terms of market share, Dr. Pepper has been gaining ground on its rivals even in a flat soda market, CNN reported. Dr. Pepper grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021 vs. a 26% drop in the overall carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to industry data cited by KDP. Dr. Pepper currently ranks as the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?More: 10 Coca-Cola Products You Can’t Buy AnymoreBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the U.S. retail market in the first nine months of 2022, CNN noted.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Quest Diagnostics (DGX). DGX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 18.57, which compares to its industry's average of 26.68. Over the past year, DGX's Forward P/E has been as high as 20.51 and as low as 11.34, with a median of 15.46.Another notable valuation metric for DGX is its P/B ratio of 2.86. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.99. Over the past year, DGX's P/B has been as high as 3.27 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.52.Finally, our model also underscores that DGX has a P/CF ratio of 11.17. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. DGX's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 29.84. Over the past year, DGX's P/CF has been as high as 11.17 and as low as 6.70, with a median of 7.82.Story continuesThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Quest Diagnostics's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, DGX looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
