Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$157 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Texas Instruments’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What Is Texas Instruments Worth?Good news, investors! Texas Instruments is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $239.69, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Texas Instruments’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Texas Instruments?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Texas Instruments' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TXN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TXN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

1,9734eaf6-44e0-3a4f-936e-4334a8fdcf74,UNM,2023-10-09,5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-impressive-ev-105500457.html,1696848900,STORY,"['PVH', 'TITN', 'AIR', 'UNM', 'VLO']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm’s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Titan Machinery Inc. TITN, PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, AAR Corp. AIR and Valero Energy Corporation VLO are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:Titan Machinery operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment dealer locations in North America and Europe.

The companies producing 5G components and hardware will benefit from increased demand for these products.Mass adoption of 5G bodes well for owners of telecommunications infrastructure, namely cell tower real estate investment trusts as well. The telecommunications providers offering 5G service to businesses and consumers stand to benefit as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet while there are many 5G-exposed stocks to choose from, just hone in a few particular names. Yes, stock predictions are not certainties. Possible 5G catalysts may fail to arrive for all of them.However, with the potential upside from the continued rollout of this technology in mind, the coming year could be a banner one for these seven 5G stocks.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comRight now, the main point of interest with mobile chip and infrastructure software company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) may be its growth potential from the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence and other types of AI-related technology.“AI mania” has sent AVGO stock soaring throughout the year. Investors are betting big that the company, especially after it closes on its pending merger deal with VMware (NYSE:VMW), will be well-positioned to capitalize on this particular megatrend.However, the rise of AI is not the only favorable trend in Broadcom’s corner. Broadcom also has much to gain from the 5G trend.Earlier this year, the company renewed a multi-billion dollar deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to provide the iPhone maker with 5G components.Trading for less than 20 times earnings, AVGO appears reasonably priced, given how the aforementioned trends/catalysts could lead to steady earnings growth in the years ahead.Story continuesCrown Castle (CCI)tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITsSource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is one of the leading cell tower REITs. As mentioned above, this sector stands to benefit from the 5G revolution, given the increased need for more cell towers to provide this service.With this, CCI is not any more one of the 5G stocks than the other cell tower REITs.So, why buy CCI stock, as opposed to peers like American Tower (NYSE:AMT) or SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC)? Rising interest rates have hit cell tower REITs considerably hard over the past two years, but with CCI, the de-rating may be overdone.Crown Castle has been pushed to a considerably lower valuation (12.1 times earnings). It sports a much higher dividend yield (6.8%) than AMT or SBAC .While projected growth helps to explain this valuation gap, a modicum of 5G growth could be all it takes for Crown Castle to close this valuation gap.Ericsson (ERIC)Ericsson (ERIC) logo on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSweden-based Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), along with Finland-based Nokia (NYSE:NOK), are benefiting greatly from geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.With the U.S. looking to prevent China’s Huawei from dominating telecom technology in the West, both these companies have the edge when it comes to winning 5G supply deals in the U.S. and its allies.That said, it may be Ericsson’s growth in developing economies that may give it the edge over Nokia. This year, a slowdown in 5G spending stateside has affected both companies. Both ERIC stock and NOK stock tumbled in July, due to weak results and guidance.However, as InvestorPlace’s Alex Sirois pointed out last month, Ericsson is achieving success in faster-growing, less-established 5G markets such as India. Couple this emerging market success with a possible easing of the 5G spending slowdown domestically next year, and ERIC may be better-positioned to positively surprise.Corning (GLW)the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comLike with Ericsson, a slowdown in U.S. 5G spending has weighed on Corning (NYSE:GLW) recently.Shares in the fiber optic cable and display glass company have moved slightly lower so far this year.Yet while a frustrating turn of events for existing GLW stock investors, this pullback gives new investors the opportunity to buy one of the top 5G stocks at a favorable entry point. How so? At current prices, GLW trades for only 16.2 times earnings, and sports a 3.68% forward dividend yield.At the same time, a likely resurgence in 5G capital expenditures, along with a rebound in smartphone demand, gives credence to analyst forecasts calling for Corning’s earnings to bounce back next year, and keep climbing in the years ahead.Investors looking for a 5G play that offers a solid combination of value, growth potential, and yield should look at GLW.Qorvo (QRVO)The logo for Qorvo (QRVO) is shown on a sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comStock predictions for Quorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) aren’t exactly rosy right now. The slump in smartphone demand has the market lukewarm about the prospects of this telecom components maker.However, when it comes to establishing a position, it may be to your advantage that sentiment for QRVO stock is not very bullish.As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, it is likely that this company, not Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), is now providing Apple with a mmWave 5G component used in 5G-enabled iPhones.This points to considerably stronger revenue and earnings in the coming quarters. Analyst consensus already calls for a big earnings rebound, but results could come in much stronger than that. For instance, hitting the high end of analyst forecasts for the next fiscal year (nearly $10 per share) could propel QRVO (in a slump since 2021) back toward all-time highs (nearly $200 per share).Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has held up well during 2023, but investors remain hesitant to bid back shares in this wireless semiconductor company.Similar to Quovo, a slowdown in demand has weighed on Skyworks’ operating performance.Still, I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that SWKS stock has ceased to be one of the best 5G stocks out there. As Morningstar analyst Brian Colello argued in August, issues like software smartphone demand may be persisting, yet these headwinds will clear up over time.SWKS currently trades for 11.7 times earnings. This low valuation suggests that sluggish results are here to stay.However, any sort of growth resurgence could catch the market by surprise, resulting in an outsized move higher for the stock. With this, now may be the perfect time to go contrarian on Skyworks Solutions.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: Shutterstock5G has been heralded as a growth driver for not just T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), but for other wireless carriers like AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as well.However, among the three, TMUS is likely your best bet.Yes, TMUS stock is pricey. Shares trade for 18 times forward earnings, while T and VZ sport forward multiples in the single digits. Both of T-Mobile’s rivals also have high dividend yields, while TMUS does not pay a dividend.However, both these “cheaper” names have performed poorly over the past five years, with both dropping by around 40% over the past five years.In contrast, TMUS has more-than-doubled during this time frame. T-Mobile has been more successful at capitalizing on the 5G trend than “Ma Bell” and Verizon. Likely to stay a winner thanks to competitive advantages, TMUS is the way to play 5G among the telcos.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the AnnouncementMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

4,4be03d30-f82e-331d-b8cc-4624a0d0333a,TMO,2023-10-09,Stable Giants: 3 Bigwig Biotech Stocks for Consistent Returns,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stable-giants-3-bigwig-biotech-152842476.html,1696260522,STORY,"['TMO', 'NVO', 'LLY']","[Biotech stocks have had a rough post-pandemic. In a year where the S&amp;P500 is up more than 10% year to date, the biotech sector is still negative to flat. Some of this may come from mean reversion, the biotech sector went wild during the pandemic search for COVID cures and vaccines. But it also shows that fundamentally many investors remain skittish about the sector as a whole.For those investors, these stable, large-cap biotech stocks may be for you. Some of the biggest names in biotech have shown consistency year after year. That consistency is likely to remain going forward. These biotech stocks are also giants in their field, dominating the mindshare of consumers and able to hire the best employees. Loyal customers and employees are two key ingredients for stable growth.Because biotech stocks will bounce back. Some biotech stocks will remain very volatile, especially small biotechs relying on clinical trials. However, the broader sector is still poised for consistent growth. As our population ages and healthcare becomes a larger share of our GDP, the biotech sector must grow to keep up with demand. As that happens, these big biotech stocks will ride the wave of the broader marker just fine.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo for investors looking for safer biotech stocks, ones which can bring good returns but with lower volatility than the small caps, here are three bigwig biotech stocks to buy now.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe largest lab supplier in the world is Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO). They supply everything a lab would ever need, from large instruments to small consumables. Their suite of reagents, instruments, and services covers the entire spectrum of biology, chemistry and medicine. They’re even a big player in the growing field of laboratory robotics.One of the reasons Thermo Fisher has been so successful and will likely remain so is the network effect. Every lab knows about them, and so whenever you want to buy anything at all, most lab’s first stop will be Thermo Fisher. Some companies specialize in antibodies, some companies specialize in separation chemistry, some companies specialize in DNA and RNA. Thermo Fisher provides all those things. So they have become the one-stop-shop for labs and lab managers, especially at small start-ups and academic institutions where purchases need to be made quickly. This network effect is hard for Thermo Fisher’s smaller companies to replicate, and so it will likely continue to contribute to their dominance even as smaller nimbler companies try to carve out their own niches.Story continuesFinancially, Thermo Fisher has held up even as the broader sector has slowed down. Their Q2 2023 earnings report showed $10.7 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in net income. Little changed year over year from $11 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in net income in Q2 2022. I know from my own experience that the broader slowdown is hitting academic labs hard, and tough choices are being made over where to spend increasingly scarce resources. But so far, few labs can afford to cut out Thermo Fisher. As the sector rebounds, Thermo Fisher will rebound too, proving itself one of the best big biotech stocks to buy right now.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)has had a very good 2023. Their stock price went over over 10% in a day when they released their Q2 2023 earnings report. That report showed revenue growing strongly year on year from $6.5 billion to $8.3 billion. And net income went up 85% year on year from $953 million to $1.763 billion.Eli Lilly’s growth was driven by growth in all sectors of its drug portfolio, but especially the growth in its diabetes drugs. Total diabetes revenue grew from $3.4 billion in Q2 2022 to $5 billion in Q2 2023, the majority of revenue growth came from the diabetes sector alone. Drugs like Trulicity and Jardiance help control blood sugar. As our population becomes more obese year after year, these drugs will be increasingly necessary.Eli Lilly is a drug stock par excellence. They have done an exceptional job at targeting the growing segment of consumer drug needs. As they are so big, they can play the averages on clinical trials. Small biotech companies can have wild swings on the results of a single trial, but for Eli Lilly no single trial will make or break the company. So as a big biotech stock, Eli Lilly can bring stability along with consistent gains.If you want a biotech stock that you can buy and hold forever, Eli Lilly is a great option. They’ve chosen drug targets in a fast-growing sector, and they have clinical trials running to keep finding better treatments to many of the most common diseases out there. That makes them one of the best big biotech stocks to buy.Novo Nordisk (NVO)Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate buildingSource: joreks / Shutterstock.comNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has been so profitable, it has fundamentally affected Denmark’s currency. With hit weight loss drugs like Wegovy, Novo Nordisk made more than 100 billion Danish Kroner in revenue in the first six months of 2023. Of course most of their sales are sold in countries with legal tender that isn’t Danish Kroner. So Novo Nordisk has to convert all its pounds, dollars, and euros into Kroner, which has affected Denmark’s exchange rate and even its interest rates.However, central bank fun facts aside, Novo Nordisk is on a strong growth trajectory that is getting even stronger. Their earnings report for the first half of 2023 shows revenue growth of over 25% and net profit growth of nearly 50%. In clinical trials, they’re pushing ever forward with their biggest drugs. For example, the much-hyped Wegovy is in clinical trials to see if it can also treat Alzheimer’s disease. That trial still has 2 years left, but it shows that Novo Nordisk is still pushing boundaries in every direction. With drugs that already have FDA approval for one condition, it makes sense to test them for many others. And that’s exactly what Novo Nordisk is doing, finding every possible profit for its most successful drugs.Weight loss drugs have long been seen as just snake-oil on daytime TV, but Novo Nordisk brought them to reality. And along with the other drugs in its pipeline, Novo Nordisk is one of the best big biotech companies to buy today.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With that in mind, the ROCE of Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Edwards Lifesciences is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$9.0b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Edwards Lifesciences has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.7% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences roceIn the above chart we have measured Edwards Lifesciences' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

9,800a8414-bc61-3c12-a21b-cd45b219a76d,UAA,2023-10-09,Stephanie Linnartz ended a successful run at Marriott to become CEO at struggling Under Armour. ‘I believe in taking calculated risks’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stephanie-linnartz-ended-successful-run-100000086.html,1696845600,STORY,"['MAR', 'UAA']","[Imagine that you grow up, literally, in the hotel industry. Your parents run an iconic pub and boutique hotel in Washington, D.C., where you spend your teenage summers cleaning rooms and working the checkout desk. After college, you intern at Hilton, go to business school, and then join the finance department of Marriott International, the largest hotel company in the world.Over the next 25 years, you rise through the ranks to become one of Marriott’s most senior executives, and its highest-ranking woman, telling Fortune in 2015 that “anyone can make it to the top here if you work really hard.” And by 2021, when you’re named one of two executives sharing the duties of acting CEO and likely in line to become the next chief executive, it seems like your lifelong devotion to this industry is about to pay off.And then you don’t get the job. What do you do next?For Stephanie Linnartz—the former president of Marriott, and now the CEO of struggling sportswear company Under Armour—the answer was: Find one of the biggest turnaround jobs out there, and get back to work.“Why things happen, we don’t ever know for sure,” she tells me during an interview at the new corner office that she’s still settling into, overlooking Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. “But life’s all about timing—and I always had this idea that the rewards of taking risks are, the great majority of the time, worth it.”On the surface, Linnartz’s decision to jump to a bro-y sportswear retailer seems like an odd fit for an executive who’s spent her career in luxury hotels. It even required a personal-style pivot: At Marriott, “I wore dresses and high heels every day,” she reminisces, but during our interview she sports her new executive uniform of Under Armour sneakers and a white zip-up jacket. And the challenges go far beyond fashion. Linnartz is several months into what she has called a three-year turnaround plan, for a once-buzzy brand that has seen its growth stagnate and share price plummet in the past decade. (Under Armour is also a much smaller company, with only $5.9 billion in revenue and 15,000 employees, to Marriott’s $20.8 billion and 140,000.) And she’s coming in as an outsider to a founder-dominated company still controlled by executive chairman Kevin Plank, four years and three chief executives after he “stepped down” from his CEO role.Story continues“She obviously has an important voice and an important role, and I’m sure that she will exert influence,” says Neil Saunders, a GlobalData Retail analyst who covers Under Armour. But “it’s very difficult, when you have someone who founded the business and still has very strong views about the business, calling some of the shots.”Still, Linnartz wanted to be a chief executive—and when the obvious path to that role closed at Marriott, she followed the advice she’s given to many other women over the years. “Take the toughest, most difficult job or project someone can give you, because that’s how you move ahead,” is how Linnartz characterized her career philosophy to Fortune eight years ago.Her new job certainly seems to fit the bill. “There are challenges,” she acknowledges. “And we’ll face them.” Under Armour, as even its employees admit, has been in trouble for a long time.Plank started the company in his grandmother’s basement in 1996, as I was told multiple times by multiple people over the course of three hours at Under Armour headquarters in August. He was inspired by his time playing college football for the University of Maryland, where he regularly sweated through cotton shirts ill-equipped to handle an athlete’s perspiration. His startup first defined itself as a founder-led seller of performance gear, one that today has a team of employees devoted to developing “revolutionary yarn” and that boasts about using “over 10,000 fabrics in our history”—most of them optimized to reduce the amount of sweat you have to deal with while performing very sweat-heavy physical feats.And for a while, Under Armour was cool. It won endorsements and signed deals with a wide range of high schools, colleges, and professional athletes, including heavy hitters: NBA superstar Steph Curry, college football powerhouse Notre Dame, even professional ballerina Misty Copeland. In 2005, less than 10 years in, Under Armour went public, successfully—its shares doubled within the first day of trading, making it the first U.S. company in five years to have such a pop. The share price peaked at a split-adjusted high of $52 in 2015, as the company’s annual revenues were soaring by 28%.But in 2023, Under Armour is struggling to grow sales or profits, and its shares are trading around $6.50. The company hasn’t accumulated the sneakerhead cred or ongoing athlete endorsements of Nike and Adidas, and its historical focus on performance, rather than fashion, has made Under Armour a lagging player in the pandemic-era athleisure boom that turned Lululemon into a juggernaut. Deadspin recently called it the “worst sports apparel company of the past 20 years,” and analysts concur that it’s “a second-tier brand,” as Saunders says. “What’s gone wrong with Under Armour is what’s always been wrong: Under Armour doesn’t really know what it is.”–87%Change in Under Armour's share price since its 2015 peak. As of 9/21/23Without many of its own stores, and without the high-polish e-commerce reputation of younger competitors, Under Armour sits in an awkward retail spot. It still relies too much on third-party retailers to sell its stuff, something that Linnartz and other executives acknowledge has led to an “inconsistent” reputation in the U.S.: Today, Under Armour might be best described as something that teenage boys’ moms buy for them, on sale, at Kohl’s. But for the woman who jumped into this turnaround job, “there’s tremendous upside,” Linnartz claims. “There’s incredible love for the brand, globally—and so I’m super excited about it.”The oldest of six children in an Irish American family, Linnartz grew up in northern Virginia—not far from the Maryland headquarters of Marriott and now Under Armour. One brother still runs the Dubliner pub, a Capitol Hill hangout that has hosted U.S. presidents and Irish ambassadors as well as plenty of locals and tourists. In person, Linnartz doesn’t come across as a chatty publican’s daughter—she’s warm but brisk, and deftly swats most questions back toward her corporate talking points. But she’s inherited a relish for focusing on customers’ experiences. She also has an affinity for complex challenges. As she climbed the ranks at Marriott, she became known for taking on projects “that were lying in plain sight, that were hard, and that needed to be tackled,” says Jim Dausch, Marriott’s former chief product and digital officer, who in June left the hotel chain after 20 years to reunite with Linnartz as Under Armour’s chief consumer officer.For example, after Marriott purchased Starwood in 2016 for $13 billion, Linnartz oversaw the massive integration between two operating systems, including the customer-loyalty programs that are so crucial for repeat business in the hospitality industry. She ultimately built its Marriott Bonvoy rewards platform, now the world’s largest such hospitality program, with 186 million members. And according to Dausch, she also kick-started a complicated and expensive overhaul of the back-end tech behind Marriott’s disparate systems. That project was becoming more high-stakes as the company expanded into all-inclusive resorts and residences and other operations, but it was one where “the company had always kind of kicked the can down the road,” Dausch says. “After the Starwood integration was over, Stephanie was the one to say, ‘We have to take this on’ … She really led that charge.”Linnartz, with Steph Curry and Under Armour employees, hopes to expand the company’s presence in “athleisure” and female-focused clothing.The last few years of Linnartz’s tenure at Marriott were overshadowed by global and personal tragedies. The pandemic upended the hotel industry; Marriott laid off tens of thousands of workers and shed $10 billion in revenue in 2020, as travel ground to a halt. At the same time, its widely respected CEO, Arne Sorenson, was fighting pancreatic cancer. In February 2021, he stepped back from running the company, which said that Linnartz and fellow top executive Tony Capuano would take over his day-to-day responsibilities. Two weeks later, Sorenson died—and before the end of the month, Marriott’s board announced that Capuano would be the next CEO. Linnartz was named president, in charge of running global consumer strategy, as well as development, technology, and emerging business.Hospitality insiders praise Capuano, a veteran development executive under whom Marriott’s stock has risen more than 31%. But some mourn the symbolic missed opportunity of Linnartz not getting the CEO role, in a relatively small travel industry where only 30% of senior executives are female and very few run large hotel or airline companies. “I think most women in the industry were disappointed that it wasn’t a woman,” says Flo Lugli, a hotel industry consultant and former senior executive at Wyndham and Radisson. “But Marriott has a great reputation of developing good leaders.”For almost two more years, Linnartz was a good soldier. But “I’ve always been a big believer in taking risk, and saying, ‘How can I grow myself as a leader and a human being?’ ” she says. When one CEO left Under Armour in June 2022 and the board started looking for a permanent replacement, “I was ready to take that next leap.”A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. And there’s another way in which her résumé has prepared her for some of the company’s challenges: At Marriott, which is still 16% owned by the eponymous Marriott family and where the founders’ descendants still very much have a voice, Sorenson in 2012 became the first non-family CEO in the company’s then-85-year history.So Linnartz knows how to work for a company where keeping the founder happy is part of the job. The challenge, with Under Armour, will be doing so while cleaning up some of the problems created on his watch. Plank—or “KP,” as longtime employees call him—occupied the CEO’s office for 24 years. His origin story is still fetishized, to a near-cultish degree, at headquarters: Buildings and apparel lines are numbered either 96 (for the year he founded Under Armour) or 37 (for the number of KP’s college football jersey). One corridor at headquarters is decorated with an enormous photo of that jersey, next to blown-up versions of Plank’s early Under Armour business cards, next to #inspo phrases like “HUMBLE &amp; HUNGRY BEGINNINGS.”For a long time, Plank was Under Armour’s best brand ambassador—until he started landing the company in the middle of ugly controversies. In 2017, he publicly praised President Trump—to the vocal displeasure of Under Armour’s celebrity spokespeople, including Curry and Copeland—before reversing course and resigning from the president’s business council over Trump’s response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Then, in 2018, the Wall Street Journal broke a series of stories on inappropriate workplace behavior and a sexualized culture at Under Armour; Plank and his executives even attended company-paid trips to strip clubs, the Journal reported. And in 2021, the company agreed to pay $9 million to settle an SEC investigation into financial disclosure failures dating back six years. At the beginning of 2020, Plank nominally stepped down from leading Under Armour, keeping his “executive chairman” role and naming company president Patrik Frisk CEO.Founder Kevin Plank remains Under Armour’s controlling shareholder.But as several chief executives elsewhere in the corporate world have discovered to their dismay in recent months, “executive chair” often means “CEO by any other name.” Frisk, interim CEO Colin Browne, and now Linnartz have all reported to Plank, who owns 65% of Under Armour’s voting shares. And outside the boardroom, KP’s public profile continues to create headaches; two days before I interviewed Linnartz for this article, unsealed court documents in a six-year-old shareholder lawsuit revealed that Plank had shared nonpublic financial information with television journalist Stephanie Ruhle. The revelations of the inappropriate-at-best relationship made widespread, gossipy headlines.“I don’t tolerate gossip—and for many people here, this is old news,” says Linnartz, adding that her approach involved “leaving some of the noise aside, that has nothing to do with the business, to focus on what is terrific about Kevin, and inspiring as only a founder can be.”Plank, for his part, declined multiple interview requests for this article. A spokesperson said that he was traveling, and sent along an emailed statement calling Linnartz “the obvious choice” for CEO. “She has hit the ground running, launching a clearly articulated three-year strategy that sets us up for strategic growth,” Plank wrote. “I could not be more excited to have her at Under Armour and to work with her every day.”However Linnartz navigates her relationship with her executive chairman over the coming months, she has plenty of cautionary tales. Recent years have given us several examples of ambitious, experienced executives—often women—who take on a CEO job that involves working for a predecessor or founder, and trying to keep him happy while fixing some of the problems he created. There’s Linda Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal executive who’s now enthusiastically embracing whatever Elon Musk has turned Twitter into. There’s Roz Brewer, the former Starbucks chief operating officer who became Walgreens CEO in 2021—and who abruptly left in late August, after two and a half years of working for Stefano Pessina, the executive chairman and largest shareholder at Walgreens. And there’s Sonia Syngal, whose 2022 exit from Gap Inc. came after two years of trying to turn around a retailer that’s more than 40% owned by its founding family. (The departures of Syngal and Brewer, who had been one of only two Black female CEOs running a Fortune 500 company, also represented losses specifically for women of color.)A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. “There’s incredible love for the brand,” she says.Everyone has a boss to keep happy—even ridiculously well-compensated CEOs—and the vagaries of working for the guy you’re supposedly replacing aren’t always gendered. But it’s striking how many ambitious women, still, have to take such risks in order to get a shot at the top spot in corporate America, where women account for barely 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs. The career choices made by Brewer, Yaccarino, and potentially Linnartz also raise questions about how much executives still have to navigate the “glass cliff,” the data-backed phenomenon in which women have to accept riskier opportunities in order to advance.So is this the tightrope Linnartz is walking at Under Armour? Probably—but “I don’t focus on that,” Linnartz says. “I believe in taking calculated risks. I don’t believe in being reckless.” And according to her friends and colleagues, she has the work ethic—and the courage—to pull Under Armour and her career back from this potential brink.“She’s very data-driven, she’s got great judgment, and she doesn’t underestimate” how much work something will be, says Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, No. 2 on this year’s Fortune Most Powerful Women list, who got to know Linnartz through her company’s consulting work for Marriott. (Under Armour has also been an Accenture client.)“She knows what the challenges are,” Sweet adds, “and she’s going to absolutely overcome them.”Six months in, Linnartz has already taken some pages from the hospitality-industry playbook—especially her experience pulling in Starwood’s beloved loyalty program, and creating Marriott Bonvoy. In July, Under Armour launched a UA Rewards program that Linnartz argues is about getting customers more excited about Under Armour—by promising them access to sports tickets or special events with celebrity athletes or early entry to sneaker launches—as much as it is about pushing merchandise. “It’s not just a transactional program,” she says. “It’s about building those connections with the customer, and building that love for the brand.”The company has re-signed some important endorsement deals this year, including with Curry and Notre Dame. More broadly, Linnartz tells Fortune, she wants to expand what Under Armour is known for, especially by increasing its offerings in footwear, “sport style” athleisure, and female-focused clothing. (Women currently account for less than 25% of Under Armour’s business.) She also has articulated a strategy of building “brand heat”—or courting a more elite reputation in the United States—by expanding Under Armour’s own full-price stores and direct-to-consumer channels, while paring back on its sales through third-party partners.It’s a lot of expansion initiatives at once, especially for a brand still struggling with inconsistency, and investors aren’t yet won over: The company’s shares are down 25% since Linnartz took over in February. But the new strategies certainly bear her stamp. And hotel industry insiders argue that Linnartz’s ability to keep many plates spinning at once, while overseeing the global consumer operations of Marriott’s 30 brands and then-8,200 properties, might be exactly the experience Under Armour needs.“Marriott has an incredible breadth of operations, and it’s attempted to redefine itself as an organization that doesn’t just give you a room and a bath and a roof over your head, but tries to create a sense of style, and a sense of belonging,” says Sean Hennessey, a hotel industry consultant and associate professor at NYU’s Tisch Center of Hospitality. “Under Armour is very much in that vein of trying to appeal to people that don’t just need a T-shirt or shorts, but who dress in that clothing because it says something about the type of people that they are.”For her part, Linnartz isn’t giving up on her Marriott loyalty—even though her new boss is a hotelier himself, and has invested in a high-end boutique hotel near Under Armour’s offices. At a certain point during our interview, when I mention the less-than-amazing experience I had at a Marriott-operated property across the Inner Harbor from Under Armour’s headquarters, she nods knowingly: “That hotel needs help.” Then she laughs: “But don’t call me about that now.”Still, “I spent 25 years of my life there—and it was a very defining part of my life,” Linnartz reflects. “I will always be loyal to Marriott.” Now it’s time to move on, and hopefully—if she manages to pull off this “toughest, most difficult job”—to move ahead.This article appears in the October/November 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""Stephanie Linnartz bets on an underdog.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

If you want to skip out on an introduction to the casino and gambling industry, then take a look at the 5 Best Small Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Casinos, whether land-based, on riverboats, or at racetracks, are extremely popular gambling establishments in the United States. In recent years, the number of commercial and tribal casinos in the U.S. has remained relatively stable, with a total of 466 commercial and 515 tribal casinos operating nationwide in 2021. The United States now hosts many of the world's major casino companies and is renowned for being home to one of the most famous gambling destinations globally—Las Vegas, Nevada. Annually, the iconic Las Vegas Strip attracts millions of visitors eager to test their luck at poker tables and slot machines, or simply enjoy the wide range of services offered by the casinos, including hotels, restaurants, live shows, and entertainment options. Due to the significant influx of American and international tourists (before COVID-19), Nevada consistently maintains its position as the U.S. state with the highest gross gaming casino revenue in the country.During the third quarter, a significant majority of gaming executives expressed satisfaction with their current business circumstances, categorizing them as either ""good"" or ""satisfactory."" However, there was a notable decline in the percentage of those optimistic about the outlook, dropping from 62% in the first quarter to 42% according to the latest report from the American Gaming Association (AGA). These positive trends come as no surprise considering the impressive growth witnessed in the gaming sector over recent years. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global gambling market achieved an approximate value of $449.04 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to expand to about $765.49 billion by 2027, showcasing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.3%. This surge is primarily propelled by the escalating legalization of gambling activities, consequently leading to a growth in the gambling population. The proliferation of legalized online sports betting sites also continues to expand rapidly across the country.

David Solomon is trying to quell internal unrest at Goldman Sachs (GS) as he refocuses the bank on its core strengths. Charles Scharf is trying to move Wells Fargo (WFC) beyond old legal troubles that won’t go away.There is a lot of scrutiny surrounding some of the nation’s biggest bank CEOs as they navigate through one of the most challenging periods for their industry since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.What they all have in common are macro pressures from high interest rates, new capital requirements, and shrinking margins, as well as the sort of political heat they haven’t faced in some time. Bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.In December eight of these big-bank CEOs will appear before the Senate Banking Committee to face the sort of grilling that was commonplace following the 2008 crisis. That includes JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman.Some of the biggest bank CEOs are headed back to Washington in December for a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Here Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, center, and others testify in 2022. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)These banks ""hold too much power in the economy,"" Committee Chair and Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said in a statement about the December hearing.Some of these big-bank CEOs are under more immediate heat than others. Here is a look at three:Citigroup CEO Jane FraserFraser, hoping to revive a stock price that trails rivals and remove decades of bloat, is making what she called the ""most consequential"" change to how Citi operates in nearly two decades.Instead of operating with two mega-divisions, she is splitting the bank into five separate units with leaders reporting directly to her. She has made it clear this will mean fewer people.""We'll be saying goodbye to some very talented and hard-working colleagues,"" Fraser wrote when she announced the moves in September.Story continuesCiti has made sweeping restructuring announcements before, under Fraser’s predecessors.“Here we go again, one more Citi restructuring,” said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo. “Why is this time different?""Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)But the big difference this time is that Fraser is “removing the middle layer” of management that initially reported to the bank’s CEO, according to a Citi spokesperson.Fraser took over Citi as CEO in 2021, long after the bank began to lag peers. Since her tenure began, the stock has fallen 30%, twice the decline of any other big bank in that time.From the beginning of 2023, the stock has declined 22%, continuing the trend. It closed Friday at $40.6, its lowest price in more than three years. The bank's return on tangible equity was 6.8% as of last quarter, lower than its five other big-bank rivals.The next wave of changes and potential layoffs will be announced sometime in November before Thanksgiving when the 150 to 200 people who report to a member of the executive management team must also make some eliminations.Citi has not yet provided actual figures for the reduction in head count or expenses but it will likely offer more detail during the release of third quarter earnings on Oct. 13 about how the reorganization will bring down costs. The actual head count number will be released early in 2024.""We have taken hard, consequential, tough decisions here,"" Fraser said while speaking at a September conference about the changes. ""They are not going to be universally popular within our bank. It's going to make some of our people very uncomfortable. I am absolutely fine with that.""Goldman CEO David SolomonPerhaps no big-bank CEO has attracted more public scrutiny than Solomon, who this past summer had to announce the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with media reports about his leadership style, job cuts, and reports of partner unrest.Under Solomon the bank is attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer lending while it waits out a tepid period of dealmaking.The good news is that the IPO market does seem to be thawing following a series of new offerings last month involving Goldman. And Goldman's lead board director ""seemed very supportive"" of Solomon in a recent meeting with Mayo, who published a note last month stating that Solomon ""is not going anywhere anytime soon.""David Solomon, Goldman's CEO. (Lucy Nicholson/REUTERS) (Lucy Nicholson / Reuters)The meeting ""leads us to conclude that the CEO will stay in his role for at least the medium term,” Mayo said in his note titled ""CEO Stays—No Ifs, ands, or buts.""Solomon told investors last month that the Wall Street giant ""is making a lot of progress, and we feel very good about where we are"" as the company navigates a series of challenges in 2023. He warned of ""some impairments and marks in commercial real estate"" in the firm's third quarter earnings.Since Solomon took over Goldman in 2018, the stock has risen 39%, outperforming all of its peers except rival Morgan Stanley.Since the beginning of 2023, Goldman’s stock is down 10%, underperforming Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan while outperforming Bank of America and Citigroup. Its return on tangible equity is 7% as of last quarter, second worst among six giant banks.Next year, he added while speaking at a Barclays conference in New York, ""should be a better year for sure.""Wells Fargo CEO Charles ScharfScharf, who took over Wells Fargo in 2019, is trying to shake the problems of the past. That is proving to be a challenge.The CEO took over in 2019, well after a fake-accounts scandal roiled the San Francisco lender and damaged its reputation.Wells Fargo &amp; Company president and CEO Charles Scharf. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)The bank is still operating under a 2018 order from the Federal Reserve that placed a cap on its total assets, a sanction designed to punish Wells Fargo for its risk-management miscues.And there have been new surprises, too. In December of last year it reached a $3.7 billion settlement including customer remediations with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on allegations that it illegally overcharged 16 million customers on their auto loans and mortgages.Since the fake-accounts scandal it has paid out $12.9 billion in penalties, settlements and customer remediations, $235 million of which came in August, according to the left of center watchdog group Good Jobs First.""We remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete,"" Scharf told investors during the bank's second quarter earnings call in July.Since Scharf took over Wells Fargo in 2019, the stock has fallen 19%, underperforming all but Citigroup. Since the beginning of 2023, Wells Fargo’s stock is down 5%, outperforming all but JPMorgan Chase.Its return on tangible equity is 10.3% as of last quarter, better than Citigroup and Goldman but trailing JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.""The company continues at a very moderated pace to make improvement, but we don't see a game changer here,"" said Ken Leon, a big bank analyst with CFRA who recently changed his rating on the stock from Buy to Hold.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Its IPO price in 2019 was $23 per share.The company hopes to stay in business with a $20 million “debtor in possession” infusion from its founders, and a “brief” marketing process for its remaining equity. The company said another $60 million was available “upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe story of SmileDirect, in other words, may not be over.Can SDC Stock Smile Through the Pain?I was skeptical of SmileDirectClub’s chances from the beginning, preferring Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN). Align sells through orthodontists, while SmileDirect used direct-to-consumer advertising.Align once provided SmileDirect with its products and held an equity interest in it. The two companies fell out after Align began offering its products through its own stores.Align’s stock is up 72% since the SmileDirect IPO. While Reddit users may have been high on SmileDirect, InvestorPlace writers like Will Ashworth have not been.The problem was always SmileDirect’s marketing costs since it was avoiding traditional channels. The idea was that adults who didn’t want to go into an office would go to a shop for clear aligners that gradually straightened their teeth.Supporters thought a switch to selling through dentists would cut SmileDirect’s costs. This led to a brief Reddit-inspired short squeeze.But I doubted that argument even at the height of the 2021 bull market.Before the filing, SmileDirect was expecting stable revenue and margins through 2025. This had some retail investors hoping for a better deal than the market is now giving them. Most, however, are now negative on the stock.Story continuesWhat Happens Next?Retail investors may continue to hold out for a better price from the founders, but it’s unlikely to move much higher.

22,03488856-231e-3ea8-8fa8-949e5a99f3a0,MSI,2023-10-09,Motorola Solutions' (NYSE:MSI) investors will be pleased with their impressive 148% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-solutions-nyse-msi-investors-103849320.html,1696847929,STORY,['MSI'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) stock is up an impressive 130% over the last five years. We note the stock price is up 1.2% in the last seven days.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the five years of share price growth, Motorola Solutions moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the Motorola Solutions share price has gained 64% in three years. Meanwhile, EPS is up 22% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Motorola Solutions has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Motorola Solutions the TSR over the last 5 years was 148%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Motorola Solutions shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Motorola Solutions that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

23,08648894-7696-4a40-b472-5a3bf27f6e7c,MSFT,2023-10-09,Apple is trying to make your devices less distracting,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-trying-to-make-your-devices-less-distracting-103227955.html,1696847547,STORY,"['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']","[Our smartphones, smartwatches, laptops, and tablets are awash in notifications. Bings, beeps, and dings regularly vie for our attention. Heck, I regularly think my phone is buzzing even when it isn’t.And checking those alerts, real or imagined, usually ends up with you scrolling through an endless parade of unrelated apps until your wife tells you to put your phone away during your romantic dinner date.Apple (AAPL), however, is looking to change that by giving you the information you need when you want it. According to Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, the solution lies in widgets.Small, interactive bits of apps that live on your iPhone’s home and lock screen, Apple Watch — and now Mac — widgets, Federighi explained, put the control over devices back into users’ hands.“Notifications, of course, can pull you out of the moment and take away, in some ways, your agency, because now it's happening to you,” Federighi told Yahoo Finance. “Not when you want to know the information but when someone wants to push it on you. And so we saw a way to correct that.”Apple hopes widgets and the Dynamic Island, can help cut down on user distraction while using its iPhones. (Image: Apple) (Apple)Widgets aren’t a new concept. Microsoft (MSFT) rolled them out as far back as 2007 as part of its ill-fated Windows Vista. You’d be forgiven if you scrubbed that particular episode from your memory, though. Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android has also been offering widgets for some time as a means of customizing your home screen as you see fit. But Apple is bringing them to its entire ecosystem of devices.The company has been carefully rolling out widgets across its software lines over the last few years, first introducing them to the iPhone in 2020 with iOS 14, and adding them to the Apple Watch as Smart Stack in watchOS 10, and the Mac with macOS Sonoma.The idea is to surface the information you want quickly without having to open up your apps or scroll through a slew of unrelated notifications.“In the end, we've created such a better experience, but also a much calmer, simpler, quieter experience across the system,” explained Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface. “So we're really excited about it and really excited about what everyone's doing. And we think this is only the beginning.”Story continuesApple's macOS Sonoma features new widget designs similar to those found on the iPhone and iPad. (Image: Apple) (Apple)Apple’s push into widgets isn’t just a means of quieting those relentless dings. According to Federighi, it’s also a way to keep you from unlocking your phone to check one app only to look up 20 minutes later with a stiff neck after browsing Reddit, scrolling Instagram, and reading a brief summary of string theory — which you definitely understand after perusing that single Wikipedia page.According to Dye, Apple began toying with the idea of adding more compact, glanceable areas for users to get information when it was developing complications for the Apple Watch. Small bits of the screen that provide data such as your heart rate, the weather, and calendar information, complications have become the basis by which many users interact with their watches.That thinking has gone from the small squares you see on your home screen to the Live Activities found in iPhone’s Dynamic Island. Live Activities for the Dynamic Island provide pertinent information like fantasy scores and how far away your Uber is via the small, pill-shaped cutout at the top of the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 lines’ screens.Live Activities also appear on your lock screen, giving you quick access to pressing notifications without forcing you to unlock your phone.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)I use Live Activities for the Yahoo Fantasy app on my iPhone 14 Pro every Sunday. It’s a quick, easy way to check in on how badly my fantasy team is losing without opening the app and invariably second-guessing every player I choose to play or sit.But if Apple users get everything they need from widgets, where does that leave the first- and third-party apps we’ve collected over the years? Do they become less useful? Not necessarily, Federighi said.“I think the app usage is much more intentional, right? You [used] it at the moment you wanted to dive in, when it was the right time for you, and not when you were pulled in,” he added.Whether Apple can get users to actually change the way they use their devices, however, remains to be seen. Being able to get your information in quick, bite-sized chunks is incredibly helpful, but, outside of Live Activities, I often find widgets as a kind of gateway to falling deeper into apps.Widgets on the Mac and Apple Watch have made it easier to quickly get the info I need and keep it moving. But on the iPhone, even the weather widget pulls me in further at times. Though that's usually because I'm trying to check the humidity since I'm a big-time sweater.That said, as Apple continues to evolve its widget strategy, I'm hoping we reach a point where stealing a quick glance at your phone is all you need.

Believe it or not, they do exist when it comes to tech right now.The first catalyst is, in fact, Friday's blowout jobs report.In the lead-up to the report, the vibe among those on the Street I chatted with was that an upside beat for the jobs report would mean a read-through to higher inflation. With higher inflation, it raises the specter of another Fed rate hike on Nov. 1. Treasury yields keep climbing in advance of that, and markets continue to suck wind.But interestingly, that didn't happen in Friday's session.Markets reversed losses, and by the afternoon, stocks were solidly in the green. I liked that the gains in stocks came alongside another push-up in Treasury yields.Some of the market's best performers on the session were big-cap tech names such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Salesforce (CRM) — stocks that have taken it on the chin amid the rise in yields. (Tech stocks hate when yields rapidly advance as they have been doing.)One day doesn't make a trend, but the favorable action in beat-up tech stocks suggests investors are willing to hunt for perceived value inside an apparently still strong US economy.The other catalyst is a nugget I gleaned from a new note by UBS strategist Solita Marcelli.Tech earnings fell by mid- to high-single-digit percentages year over year in the first half of this year, mostly due to weakening consumer demand. Investments in areas like AI also weighed on growth rates.Marcelli thinks that the earnings dynamic is poised to change in a big way and will kick off this approaching earnings season.Story continues""With a rising contribution from AI, better base effects, and pricing power, we expect global tech earnings to turn positive in the third quarter and grow by around 16% for full-year 2024 (compared to around 9% for global equities). As a result, the tech sector should emerge as the fastest-growing segment within global equities next year,"" Marcelli said.The biggest upside opportunities in tech, according to Marcelli's work: cyclically focused semiconductors, which have been hit hard by demand fears.Others on the Street are also warming back up to tech names as we head into earnings.Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives is bullish on Amazon, Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) at this current market juncture. Similar to Marcelli, he sees value in part because of the earnings potential of tech.Explained Ives, ""Our view of tech stocks is that the transformational growth around AI, cloud, cyber security, and rebound of digital ad dollars will create a springboard of growth into 2024 that is currently being underappreciated by the Street. The Fed will cut in 2024 (can debate 2 or 3 cuts) and we believe this near-term obsession with the 10-year will dissipate as yields move lower and the soft landing takes place in 2024 with the Fed's hand forced.""Catalysts.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Air Polluted Countries in the World.Air pollution is a major challenge to the environment and public health, costing us billions of dollars each year in lost productivity, healthcare costs, as well as damage to property. Moreover, air pollution contributes significantly to global warming. When pollutants are released into the atmosphere, they trap heat, which causes our planet to get warm. Things get worse when plants and trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are damaged.According to a report by the International Energy Agency, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes grew 0.9% or 321 metric tons to reach a new-all time high of 36.8 gigatons in 2022.Moreover, on September 8, Reuters reported that according to a study by Climate Central, around 98% of the total world’s population was exposed to higher temperatures from June to August as a result of human-induced climate change. The report also mentions that the northern hemisphere summer this year was the hottest since records began. Prolonged heat waves in North America and southern Europe caused disastrous wildfires as well as a surge in mortality rates. July 2023 has been the world’s hottest month yet on record.Business and the Fight Against Climate ChangeIn one of our previous articles about countries with cleanest air, we mentioned that governments around the world are now focusing on reducing carbon emissions. More recently, on October 6, Reuters reported that in an effort that can help the US achieve its goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions this decade, the US Environmental Protection Agency introduced 2 new measures to reduce climate-warming chemicals in air conditioners and refrigerators. The government agency put out a final rule that limits the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), used in 40 types of imported and domestically manufactured foams, aerosol products, and air conditioning, refrigeration, and heat pump appliances and instruments.Story continuesThe fight against climate change requires urgent and transformative changes to lower the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Consumers and investors are also increasingly demanding that companies demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and improve their reputation with stakeholders.A number of corporations have also joined in the fight to capture and remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere. On October 2, Reuters reported that the US government has indicated its plan to purchase carbon dioxide removal (CDR) services directly, and big businesses such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) are investing heavily in carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. The US Government Department of Energy had previously also allocated $3.5 billion to build four direct air capture facilities. These plants can arrest CO2 emissions in the atmosphere before burying it or using it to make industrial materials.The report also mentions that sales in the carbon removal sector have surged. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) have also purchased $200 million of carbon removals, with the potential to capture and store 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has pledged to acquire over 2.7 million tons of carbon removals from Ørsted A/S’s (CPH:ORSTED) wood-chip fired Asnaes power station.The growing demand for carbon removals indicates that businesses and governments are taking climate change seriously. On September 12, Reuters reported in a separate post that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is one of the biggest companies in the world by revenue, announced its investment in direct air capture (DAC) technology, which removes emissions from the atmosphere. To meet its climate target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040, the e-commerce giant will purchase 250,000 tons of removal credits over 10 years from the 1PointFive direct air capture plant in Texas. The plant is being developed by the American oil company Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (NYSE:OXY) Oxy Low Carbon Ventures subsidiary. The report also mentions that in 2022, Amazon.com, Inc. 's (NASDAQ:AMZN) carbon footprint was 71.27 million metric tons. While some criticize the role of oil companies in developing plants to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, Jamey Mulligan, head of carbon neutralization science and strategy at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) said:“We have to have massive scale very quickly, 1PointFive and Occidental have significant knowledge, expertise and workforce and experience that’s needed to scale industrial plants like this.”Despite efforts by companies and governments around the world, carbon emissions and air pollution in some regions around the world continues to worsen. For now, let’s take a look at the 30 most air polluted countries in the world.30 Most Air Polluted Countries in the WorldKekyalyaynen / Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn this article, we have ranked the 30 most air polluted countries in the world. To rank the most air polluted countries in the world, we consulted the IQAir World Air Quality Ranking. This database provided us with a list of countries and information on the annual average measured concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5 is widely available and considered the most hazardous air pollutant impacting human health. PM2.5 is measured by micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³). We used data available for the latest year in their dataset, which is for the year 2022. We then narrowed down our selection to rank the top 30 most air polluted countries in the world based on their annual average PM2.5 concentration. The 30 most air polluted countries in the world are listed below in ascending order.30 Most Air Polluted Countries in the World30. VietnamAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 27.2First up on our list of 30 most air polluted countries in the world is Vietnam. Poor air quality in Vietnam is a result of urbanization, crop burning, dust from construction, and most importantly vehicular emissions.Some of the big companies that are investing in cleaning up the atmosphere include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).29. LaosAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 27.6Laos is a country in Southeast Asia. Laos doesn’t have a large number of heavy industries and electricity is produced by hydropower. However, high levels of air pollution is caused by waste burning, burning scrubland for hunting, clearing land for crop growing, as well as dust and sand.28. MongoliaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 29.5Bordered by China to the south and Russia to the north, Mongolia is a landlocked country in East Asia known for vast, rugged expanses and nomadic culture. However, urbanization, burning of organic matter as well as coal-burning stoves in Mongolia, have all played a major role in polluting the air.27. GhanaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 30.2Ghana, a country in West Africa, is home to miles of sandy beaches as well as lush forests. Unfortunately, the country has a waste management problem. Main causes of air pollution in Ghana include solid fuel combustion for cooking, waste burning, vehicle emissions, and dust.26. IndonesiaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 30.4Indonesia is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia, and is best known for its jungles and beaches. However, because of factories, coal-fired power plants and traffic congestion, Indonesia has poor air quality.25. ChinaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 30.6China is one of the largest and most populated countries in the world, and it ranks among the top 30 most air polluted countries in the world. Coal for electricity generation has been the main source of air pollution in China. Coal-powered industries, which are playing a major role in China’s economic development, have increasingly contributed to poor air quality in the country.24. KyrgyzstanAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 31.1Known for its stunning mountain ranges, Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in Central Asia. However, dust and the massive amount of coal used in Kyrgyzstan greatly damages air quality. Unfortunately, brown coal, which is a cheaper option in the country, has a higher ash content and causes more pollution than other types of coal.23. EthiopiaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 31.3Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, is a rugged, landlocked country. Main causes of poor air quality in Ethiopia include factories, construction activities, vehicular emissions, burning stubble and fossil fuels as well as wildfires.22. ArmeniaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 31.4Known for its beautiful landscapes, Armenia is a landlocked country in West Asia. However, vehicular emissions, urban development, mines and industrial emissions, all have contributed to air pollution in Armenia, which ranks at the number 22 spot on our list of 30 most air polluted countries in the world.21. IranAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 32.5Iran, also known as Persia, is a country in the Middle East. Vehicle emissions contribute greatly to the poor air quality in Iran. Other causes include refinery operations, and industrial emissions.20. UzbekistanAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 33.5Known for its ancient cities and amazing nature, Uzbekistan is a country in Central Asia. However, according to recent reported data, Uzbekistan now ranks among the top 20 most air polluted countries in the world. Burning of coal and massive use of outdated automobiles amongst the population contributes significantly to the air pollution. Other causes include fumes from power plants, factories, and other industrial areas.19. Bosnia and HerzegovinaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 33.6Located in the Balkans, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country in southeastern Europe. The country’s reliance on burning wood and coal for heat, outdated diesel vehicles for transportation, and coal to generate electricity, all contribute to poor air quality.18. NigeriaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 36.9Home to many natural landmarks and wildlife reserves, Nigeria is a country in West Africa. However, vehicles with old engines and harmful emissions as well as firewood, coal, and open waste burning all damage Nigeria’s environment with air pollutants. 17. UgandaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 39.6Uganda is a country in East Africa with a diverse landscape. However, urbanization and population growth is driving air pollution in the country. Vehicular and industrial emissions, trash burning, biomass-fueled cookstoves, and dust are all contributing to air pollution in Uganda.16. NepalAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 40.1Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia, and it ranks among the poorest countries in the world as well. Vehicle emissions, open waste burning, emissions from brick kilns or factories, and road dust are the main causes of air pollution in Nepal.15. Saudi ArabiaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 41.5Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Middle East. The country is largely dependent on its production of oil. However, oil production, vehicular emissions, and urban activities in major cities all contribute greatly to the poor air quality in Saudi Arabia, which ranks among the top most air polluted countries in the world.14. QatarAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 42.5Qatar is a country in the Middle East, where the energy sector is the most damaging to air quality because of the huge contributions of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Other causes of air pollution in Qatar include dust storms and vehicular emissions.13. RwandaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 44Rwanda is a landlocked country in Central Africa. The use of wood and charcoal for cooking, vehicular emissions, as well as dust storms and wildfires are all significant sources of air pollutants in Rwanda.12. SudanAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 44.6Sudan is a country in Northeast Africa that ranks at the number 12 spot in our list of 30 most air polluted countries in the world. Cement manufacturing, waste burning, vehicle emissions, and oil production and processing all contribute to the poor air quality in Sudan.11. United Arab EmiratesAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 45.9The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a country in the Middle East. Vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction sites, and dust storms are all major contributors to the air pollution in UAE.10. TajikistanAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 46Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia that ranks among the top most air polluted countries in the world. The industrial and vehicle emissions add greatly to air pollution in Tajikistan.9. EgyptAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 46.5Egypt is a country located on two continents, Africa and Asia, spanning the regions of North Africa and the Middle East. Major sources of air pollutants in Egypt include dust, high emissions, and the open burning of solid organic waste material.8. IndiaAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 53.3India is a country in South Asia, and ranks among the largest countries in the world by area. Dust and construction as well as waste burning all contribute greatly to the air pollution in India.7. KuwaitAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 55.8Kuwait is a country in the Middle East, with huge oil reserves. However, the country’s oil industry, burning of fossil fuels, as well as the extraction, drilling, and fracking, all play a role in damaging the quality of air in Kuwait.6. Burkina FasoAnnual Average PM2.5 Concentration (μg/m³): 63Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. In Burkina Faso, energy mainly comes from burning biomass such as firewood and charcoal. Biomass burning is a major source of particle pollution, and so it comes as no surprise that Burkina Faso ranks high among the most air polluted countries in the world.Prominent names that are making efforts to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

A “blowout” jobs report last week raised the likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again, further constraining net interest income growth and highlighting the need to lower business costs.Quarterly reports from PepsiCo Inc., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Domino’s Pizza Inc. will underscore the dwindling spending power of American consumers, who now hold less cash in hand than they did before the pandemic.Monday: No earnings of note.Tuesday: Pepsi (PEP US) earnings are seen rising 9.4%, slowing after two quarters of double-digit gains. Concerns that cost-conscious customers will switch to cheaper brands may be overstated, Goldman Sachs said, noting that PepsiCo enjoys a “favorable geographic footprint” over rivals. However, BI said unfavorable foreign-exchange rates likely crimped quarterly revenue growth. Pepsi, which has the capacity to take on $10 billion of debt without hurting its credit profile, could be looking to further grow its portfolio of snack brands; the company had shown interest in buying Hostess Brands, which was eventually sold to J.M. Smucker.Wednesday: No earnings of note.Thursday: Walgreens Boots’ (WBA US) adjusted earnings per share likely shrank 14% in the quarter, with Jefferies analysts expecting continued pressure on the profitability of its US retail pharmacy segment, the company’s largest money maker. Operational issues with VillageMD, a clinic operator in which Walgreens has a controlling stake, also likely weighed on performance. Analysts are calling Walgreen’s 2024 and 2025 guidance into question amid the drugstore chain’s recent C-suite shakeout.Story continuesDelta Air Lines (DAL US) has seen estimates for its third-quarter adjusted earnings revised downwards as higher fuel and labor costs bite. The carrier’s four-year contract with its pilots, signed in March, will further erode margins at a time when slowing domestic demand is also squeezing passenger yield, BI said.Domino’s Pizza’s (DPZ US) domestic same-store sales growth was flat in the quarter from a year ago, dragged down by fewer delivery orders, BI said. A revamped loyalty program and a new partnership with Uber Eats could help in the fourth quarter, though the worsening global consumer environment will continue to weigh on earnings, Barclays said.Friday: JPMorgan (JPM US) is set to post the fastest earnings-per-share growth among major US investment banks this reporting season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income likely jumped 27% in the period, offsetting declines in trading revenues and investment-banking fees. The bank could beat its full-year NII guidance, defying the impact of persistently higher interest rates, said Piper Sandler. JPMorgan’s third-quarter report is due pre-market.Citigroup (C US) earnings likely fell 18%, while Wells Fargo’s (WFC US) are projected to decline 3.6%. Expenses and efficiencies will be under increased scrutiny in both reports, which are due before the opening bell. Rising operating costs are outpacing Citi’s revenue growth and weighing on profitability, even as the bank prepares to overhaul its organizational structure, BI said. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has reiterated its full-year expense outlook but also has opportunities for more efficiencies, Piper Sandler said.PNC Financial Services (PNC US) could say more about this month’s purchase of a $17 billion portfolio of capital-commitment facilities from Signature Bank, on its third-quarter earnings call. The deal should add around 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter without materially impacting PNC’s capital ratios, RBC Capital Markets said. Earnings and revenue likely shrank in the third quarter, with net interest margin down for the first time after six straight quarters of growth.BlackRock’s (BLK US) adjusted earnings are projected to fall 11% from a year ago, as the firm faces challenges from slowing institutional flows and foreign-currency headwinds, Citi analysts said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraCan AI Beat the Market?

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) shareholders have enjoyed a 77% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 50% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 35% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Roper Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 1.0% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 45.15.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Roper Technologies, it has a TSR of 82% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Roper Technologies has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 35% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

David Solomon is trying to quell internal unrest at Goldman Sachs (GS) as he refocuses the bank on its core strengths. Charles Scharf is trying to move Wells Fargo (WFC) beyond old legal troubles that won’t go away.There is a lot of scrutiny surrounding some of the nation’s biggest bank CEOs as they navigate through one of the most challenging periods for their industry since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.What they all have in common are macro pressures from high interest rates, new capital requirements, and shrinking margins, as well as the sort of political heat they haven’t faced in some time. Bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.In December eight of these big-bank CEOs will appear before the Senate Banking Committee to face the sort of grilling that was commonplace following the 2008 crisis. That includes JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman.Some of the biggest bank CEOs are headed back to Washington in December for a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Here Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, center, and others testify in 2022. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)These banks ""hold too much power in the economy,"" Committee Chair and Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said in a statement about the December hearing.Some of these big-bank CEOs are under more immediate heat than others. Here is a look at three:Citigroup CEO Jane FraserFraser, hoping to revive a stock price that trails rivals and remove decades of bloat, is making what she called the ""most consequential"" change to how Citi operates in nearly two decades.Instead of operating with two mega-divisions, she is splitting the bank into five separate units with leaders reporting directly to her. She has made it clear this will mean fewer people.""We'll be saying goodbye to some very talented and hard-working colleagues,"" Fraser wrote when she announced the moves in September.Story continuesCiti has made sweeping restructuring announcements before, under Fraser’s predecessors.“Here we go again, one more Citi restructuring,” said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo. “Why is this time different?""Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)But the big difference this time is that Fraser is “removing the middle layer” of management that initially reported to the bank’s CEO, according to a Citi spokesperson.Fraser took over Citi as CEO in 2021, long after the bank began to lag peers. Since her tenure began, the stock has fallen 30%, twice the decline of any other big bank in that time.From the beginning of 2023, the stock has declined 22%, continuing the trend. It closed Friday at $40.6, its lowest price in more than three years. The bank's return on tangible equity was 6.8% as of last quarter, lower than its five other big-bank rivals.The next wave of changes and potential layoffs will be announced sometime in November before Thanksgiving when the 150 to 200 people who report to a member of the executive management team must also make some eliminations.Citi has not yet provided actual figures for the reduction in head count or expenses but it will likely offer more detail during the release of third quarter earnings on Oct. 13 about how the reorganization will bring down costs. The actual head count number will be released early in 2024.""We have taken hard, consequential, tough decisions here,"" Fraser said while speaking at a September conference about the changes. ""They are not going to be universally popular within our bank. It's going to make some of our people very uncomfortable. I am absolutely fine with that.""Goldman CEO David SolomonPerhaps no big-bank CEO has attracted more public scrutiny than Solomon, who this past summer had to announce the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with media reports about his leadership style, job cuts, and reports of partner unrest.Under Solomon the bank is attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer lending while it waits out a tepid period of dealmaking.The good news is that the IPO market does seem to be thawing following a series of new offerings last month involving Goldman. And Goldman's lead board director ""seemed very supportive"" of Solomon in a recent meeting with Mayo, who published a note last month stating that Solomon ""is not going anywhere anytime soon.""David Solomon, Goldman's CEO. (Lucy Nicholson/REUTERS) (Lucy Nicholson / Reuters)The meeting ""leads us to conclude that the CEO will stay in his role for at least the medium term,” Mayo said in his note titled ""CEO Stays—No Ifs, ands, or buts.""Solomon told investors last month that the Wall Street giant ""is making a lot of progress, and we feel very good about where we are"" as the company navigates a series of challenges in 2023. He warned of ""some impairments and marks in commercial real estate"" in the firm's third quarter earnings.Since Solomon took over Goldman in 2018, the stock has risen 39%, outperforming all of its peers except rival Morgan Stanley.Since the beginning of 2023, Goldman’s stock is down 10%, underperforming Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan while outperforming Bank of America and Citigroup. Its return on tangible equity is 7% as of last quarter, second worst among six giant banks.Next year, he added while speaking at a Barclays conference in New York, ""should be a better year for sure.""Wells Fargo CEO Charles ScharfScharf, who took over Wells Fargo in 2019, is trying to shake the problems of the past. That is proving to be a challenge.The CEO took over in 2019, well after a fake-accounts scandal roiled the San Francisco lender and damaged its reputation.Wells Fargo &amp; Company president and CEO Charles Scharf. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)The bank is still operating under a 2018 order from the Federal Reserve that placed a cap on its total assets, a sanction designed to punish Wells Fargo for its risk-management miscues.And there have been new surprises, too. In December of last year it reached a $3.7 billion settlement including customer remediations with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on allegations that it illegally overcharged 16 million customers on their auto loans and mortgages.Since the fake-accounts scandal it has paid out $12.9 billion in penalties, settlements and customer remediations, $235 million of which came in August, according to the left of center watchdog group Good Jobs First.""We remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete,"" Scharf told investors during the bank's second quarter earnings call in July.Since Scharf took over Wells Fargo in 2019, the stock has fallen 19%, underperforming all but Citigroup. Since the beginning of 2023, Wells Fargo’s stock is down 5%, outperforming all but JPMorgan Chase.Its return on tangible equity is 10.3% as of last quarter, better than Citigroup and Goldman but trailing JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.""The company continues at a very moderated pace to make improvement, but we don't see a game changer here,"" said Ken Leon, a big bank analyst with CFRA who recently changed his rating on the stock from Buy to Hold.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
37,93bc4d76-cbd1-3116-8505-5e3b7113abcb,LEG,2023-10-09,"A Note On Leggett & Platt, Incorporated's (NYSE:LEG) ROE and Debt To Equity",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/note-leggett-platt-incorporateds-nyse-110640202.html,1696849600,STORY,['LEG'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Leggett &amp; Platt is:14% = US$232m ÷ US$1.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.Does Leggett &amp; Platt Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Leggett &amp; Platt has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Consumer Durables industry (17%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Leggett &amp; Platt visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Leggett &amp; Platt's Debt And Its 14% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Leggett &amp; Platt, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.21. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

""We are going to continue to offer a variety of other plans.""Netflix is rolling out an advertisement-supported plan, offering subscribers a monthly plan at 4.99 pounds ($6.07), but the spokesperson did not comment on its availability in Kenya.Although low middle-income economies like Kenya offer streaming services big opportunities for subscriber growth, they also pose challenges as purchasing power dwindles due to inflation, industry executives said.Under the free plan, which will end on Nov. 1, viewers were able to watch Western-produced shows like ""Money Heist"" and ""Bridgerton"", and African ones like ""Blood &amp; Water"".Netflix has been commissioning more home-grown content from around Africa as part of its strategy to snag new subscribers on the continent.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cutsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.Story continuesNetflix eyes price bump after actors strike: reportAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price bumps in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbersShares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations &amp; represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens gripStarting recently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.Senad Karaahmetovic and Sam Boughedda, contributed to this report.Related ArticlesTesla's Q3 flop; Netflix's price hike; Rivian's plunge: Weekly tech roundupNew COVID shots still hard to find for some AmericansIsrael markets sink, businesses shut after Hamas attack]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the oncology industry, head directly to 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.The global oncology landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to discover, develop, and provide innovative treatments aimed at improving outcomes for a growing number of patients. However, the accessibility and utilization of these new cancer medications vary significantly worldwide. According to IQVIA, the number of oncology clinical trials initiated in 2022 remained high, marking a 22% increase since 2018. Over the past five years, there has been a consistent annual rise of 5% in the global population of patients receiving cancer treatment. Projections indicate that global spending on cancer drugs is set to reach $375 billion by 2027, a significant increase from $196 billion in 2022. The oncology portfolio is expanding rapidly, with more than 2,000 products currently in development. A substantial portion of these products, nearly 71%, is being developed by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. These companies have significantly increased their contributions to the development of cancer therapies, up from 51% in 2017. Globally, 237 new active substances have been introduced for cancer treatment over the past two decades, with almost 115 launched within the last five years. The United States has seen 78 NAS launches in the past five years and a total of 189 over the last two decades.The steady rise in cancer treatment can be attributed to aging populations and improved access to healthcare services in developed markets. In lower-income markets, efforts to expand healthcare access and longer treatment durations have led to a higher number of patients receiving cancer treatment each year.As per Fortune Business Insights’ findings, the global market for oncology drugs reached a value of $184.95 billion in 2022. Projections indicate significant growth, with the market expected to increase from $205.52 billion in 2023 to an estimated $484.32 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% during the forecast period. Oncology drugs include a wide range of treatments, including targeted therapies, chemotherapy agents, immunotherapies, and hormone therapies, all developed to combat cancer. Several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including the increasing prevalence of different types of cancer, the approval and launch of new drugs, and improved research efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the oncology field. For instance, as per data released by the American Cancer Society in January, 2023 will see a rise in cancer patients in the United States, with an anticipated 28% increase compared to 2010, resulting in approximately 1.96 million cancer cases by the end of 2023.Story continuesFaced with a severe shortage of over a dozen cancer medications, the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the temporary importation of chemotherapy drugs from international manufacturers not currently approved for distribution in the United States, an FDA spokesperson told CNBC. This potential move aims to address a pressing issue highlighted by medical professionals at hospitals across the country, particularly concerning two drugs – cisplatin and carboplatin, which play a critical role in cancer treatment and are widely utilized. The World Health Organization has recognized the significance of these drugs in basic healthcare. Shortages of these drugs have compelled hospitals to ration their supply by reducing doses and prioritizing patients who stand to gain the most from treatment. Dr. Abdul Rafeh Naqash, a doctor at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma, stated:“The lawmakers in the country need to understand that this is a big problem at this point, where unless something changes in the next few weeks, this can lead to a big national emergency from a patient and health care standpoint.”The shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are the result of a temporary production halt for the U.S. market at an Intas Pharmaceuticals facility in India. Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, pointed out that these shortages highlight a persistent economic issue in the generic drug market. She also noted that the demand for these drugs is expected to increase in the coming years due to an aging population, as older individuals face a higher risk of cancer.In this article, we discuss some of the top cancer stocks to invest in, which include Pfizer Inc.

We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”10.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”8.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”6. Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“In health care we exited global biotechnology company Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Similar to many of its large cap pharma/biotech peers, Amgen is facing patent cliffs for its major drugs in the second half of the decade, while the company’s pipeline has disappointed. In addition, Amgen is facing above-average pricing pressure impacting a number of its current products that compete in crowded therapeutic areas. Amgen is now relying more heavily on acquisitions to address its patent cliff and weak internal pipeline. However, Amgen’s recently proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is being challenged by the FTC, creating further uncertainty.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds10 Best Small-Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Hedge Funds Disclosure: None. 14 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Most of the loading will take place in Santos and Paranagua ports.""This massive delivery shall create huge lineups with big waiting times in Oct-Nov when sugar vessels still compete with the grain exports and are also exposed to eventual delays related to the rainy season,"" said sugar analyst Claudiu Covrig.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

If you want to skip out on an introduction to the casino and gambling industry, then take a look at the 5 Best Small Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying.Casinos, whether land-based, on riverboats, or at racetracks, are extremely popular gambling establishments in the United States. In recent years, the number of commercial and tribal casinos in the U.S. has remained relatively stable, with a total of 466 commercial and 515 tribal casinos operating nationwide in 2021. The United States now hosts many of the world's major casino companies and is renowned for being home to one of the most famous gambling destinations globally—Las Vegas, Nevada. Annually, the iconic Las Vegas Strip attracts millions of visitors eager to test their luck at poker tables and slot machines, or simply enjoy the wide range of services offered by the casinos, including hotels, restaurants, live shows, and entertainment options. Due to the significant influx of American and international tourists (before COVID-19), Nevada consistently maintains its position as the U.S. state with the highest gross gaming casino revenue in the country.During the third quarter, a significant majority of gaming executives expressed satisfaction with their current business circumstances, categorizing them as either ""good"" or ""satisfactory."" However, there was a notable decline in the percentage of those optimistic about the outlook, dropping from 62% in the first quarter to 42% according to the latest report from the American Gaming Association (AGA). These positive trends come as no surprise considering the impressive growth witnessed in the gaming sector over recent years. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global gambling market achieved an approximate value of $449.04 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to expand to about $765.49 billion by 2027, showcasing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.3%. This surge is primarily propelled by the escalating legalization of gambling activities, consequently leading to a growth in the gambling population. The proliferation of legalized online sports betting sites also continues to expand rapidly across the country. In a recent development, Kentucky became the 35th state to legalize sportsbooks, making it the 25th state to offer legal sports betting. Simultaneously, the pent-up demand resulting from the pandemic spurred a surge of travelers to casino destinations. In the month of August, Nevada marked its 30th consecutive month with gambling wins exceeding $1 billion, underscoring the industry's vitality.Story continuesCasino stocks have gained traction with investors this year due to anticipated growth and favorable projections from analysts. Prominent casino stocks like MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR), and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) have already yielded favorable returns for shareholders.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of global inflation and the cost of living crisis, you may go to 5 Places to Retire for $1,000 a Month.Global Inflation and the Cost of Living CrisisAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Reports 2023, the most severe global risk crisis that the world will be facing for the next two years is the “cost-of-living” crisis. The report states that,“Governments and central banks could face stubborn inflationary pressures over the next two years, not least given the potential for a prolonged war in Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic and economic warfare spurring supply chain decoupling,”Due to the global cost-of-living crisis, many countries have been facing double and triple-digit year-on-year food price inflation. The global food and energy price surges caused by the war in Ukraine has, in turn, led an estimated 71 million people to fall into poverty, notes a 2022 report by the United Nations Global Development Programme. Many economies such as the USA have had inflation reach 40-year highs. The International Monetary Fund reveals that food inflation has been responsible for eroding global living standards at the same rate as inflation of all consumption did in the five years before the pandemic.The World Food Programme further highlights that more than 345 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity in 2023. Even worse, 129,000 people are expected to face famine in places such as Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso, and South Sudan. The latest World Bank figures reveal that food price inflation between May and August 2023 remains high for countries around the world. 69.6% of high-income countries, 64% of upper-middle-income countries, 86.4% of lower-middle-income countries, and 52.6% of low-income countries face high levels of inflation. Inflation levels in many of these countries have breached the double-digit threshold, intensifying the economic challenges that these countries face.Story continuesAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, what has exacerbated the food insecurity situation around the world, many countries have been putting food trade restrictions as a means to increase domestic supply and reduce prices. As of September 2023, a total of 19 countries have implemented 25 food export bans, while 7 countries have implemented 12 export-limiting measures, reports the World Bank.Role of Corporations in Fueling InflationBesides the lingering impacts of the Ukraine war and supply chain bottlenecks, major US corporations have also been responsible for the rising levels of inflation around the world. According to a Unite investigation, nearly 60% of inflation in 2021 has been because of corporate profits. Further, New York Times reveals that some of the biggest corporations have said they do not plan to change their course when it comes to increasing their prices. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are some of the companies that have raised their prices throughout the year. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the consumer goods giant, made a series of price hikes in 2023 that led to an organic sales growth of 7%.Moreover, in Q4 2023, sales for the company increased by 5% to $20.6 billion. Companies such as The PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have been able to maintain these higher prices, even after inflation has started to moderate, by pitching their offerings as “premium products”. “Irresistible superiority” is the term the consumer goods company has used to describe the high value their products offer to customers. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its average prices by 15% in the three months ending June 2023.""In developed markets, we see consumers still really doing quite well... they may be pulling back to some degree on the bigger ticket purchases... but we are an affordable luxury... people are still buying our products at a healthy rate,"" Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters.As a result, Q2 2023 saw net income boost to $2.75 million, and the company anticipates its full-year earnings to be up by 12%. Many food corporations have also been benefitting from inflation-driven price increases, such as Conagra, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). Profits for The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), the multinational food company that makes Kool-Aid and Jell-O, in Q4 2022 were up by nearly 450%. Q2 2023 saw the company raising its prices by 11% year-over-year.Similarly, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), one of the largest meat companies in the US, also saw its profits double between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022. In recent news, with chicken prices hitting record highs in US grocery stores, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) and similar companies are all set to benefit from a boost in margins as customers divert to chicken from beef and pork due to inflationary pressures.Due to the current cost-of-living crisis, the hardest hit demographic amongst all are retirees with fixed earnings.

62,9d6fd05d-f10d-3d0b-975c-9604c7d118c9,MA,2023-10-09,Will Lockheed (LMT) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-beat-estimates-again-161010055.html,1696608610,STORY,['LMT'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.When looking at the last two reports, this aerospace and defense company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.30%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Lockheed was expected to post earnings of $6.43 per share, but it reported $6.73 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.07 per share, while it actually produced $6.43 per share, a surprise of 5.93%.For Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Lockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 17, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

63,e7c73925-99a4-3aa8-aa0e-fba02671abfa,MA,2023-10-09,Is There An Opportunity With Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) 39% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-lockheed-martin-corporations-nyse-140010565.html,1696600810,STORY,['LMT'],"[Key InsightsLockheed Martin's estimated fair value is US$649 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$397 suggests Lockheed Martin is potentially 39% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 32% higher than Lockheed Martin's analyst price target of US$492Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.44bUS$6.45bUS$6.85bUS$7.19bUS$7.43bUS$7.66bUS$7.87bUS$8.07bUS$8.27bUS$8.46bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.39%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.7kUS$5.6kUS$5.5kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.2%) = US$205bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$110bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$163b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$397, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.845. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

66,0bad76ff-cdd3-327c-86ae-cfed9d689dfc,BAX,2023-10-09,Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) shareholders have endured a 51% loss from investing in the stock three years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-nyse-bax-shareholders-132425193.html,1696771465,STORY,['BAX'],"[If you are building a properly diversified stock portfolio, the chances are some of your picks will perform badly. But the long term shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Unfortunately, they have held through a 53% decline in the share price in that time. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 34% lower in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 20% in the last 90 days.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Baxter International While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Baxter International saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Baxter International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Baxter International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Baxter International's TSR for the last 3 years was -51%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 18% in the last year, Baxter International shareholders lost 32% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Baxter International  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the oncology industry, head directly to 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.The global oncology landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to discover, develop, and provide innovative treatments aimed at improving outcomes for a growing number of patients. However, the accessibility and utilization of these new cancer medications vary significantly worldwide. According to IQVIA, the number of oncology clinical trials initiated in 2022 remained high, marking a 22% increase since 2018. Over the past five years, there has been a consistent annual rise of 5% in the global population of patients receiving cancer treatment. Projections indicate that global spending on cancer drugs is set to reach $375 billion by 2027, a significant increase from $196 billion in 2022. The oncology portfolio is expanding rapidly, with more than 2,000 products currently in development. A substantial portion of these products, nearly 71%, is being developed by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. These companies have significantly increased their contributions to the development of cancer therapies, up from 51% in 2017. Globally, 237 new active substances have been introduced for cancer treatment over the past two decades, with almost 115 launched within the last five years. The United States has seen 78 NAS launches in the past five years and a total of 189 over the last two decades.The steady rise in cancer treatment can be attributed to aging populations and improved access to healthcare services in developed markets. In lower-income markets, efforts to expand healthcare access and longer treatment durations have led to a higher number of patients receiving cancer treatment each year.As per Fortune Business Insights’ findings, the global market for oncology drugs reached a value of $184.95 billion in 2022. Projections indicate significant growth, with the market expected to increase from $205.52 billion in 2023 to an estimated $484.32 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% during the forecast period. Oncology drugs include a wide range of treatments, including targeted therapies, chemotherapy agents, immunotherapies, and hormone therapies, all developed to combat cancer. Several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including the increasing prevalence of different types of cancer, the approval and launch of new drugs, and improved research efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the oncology field. For instance, as per data released by the American Cancer Society in January, 2023 will see a rise in cancer patients in the United States, with an anticipated 28% increase compared to 2010, resulting in approximately 1.96 million cancer cases by the end of 2023.Story continuesFaced with a severe shortage of over a dozen cancer medications, the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the temporary importation of chemotherapy drugs from international manufacturers not currently approved for distribution in the United States, an FDA spokesperson told CNBC. This potential move aims to address a pressing issue highlighted by medical professionals at hospitals across the country, particularly concerning two drugs – cisplatin and carboplatin, which play a critical role in cancer treatment and are widely utilized. The World Health Organization has recognized the significance of these drugs in basic healthcare. Shortages of these drugs have compelled hospitals to ration their supply by reducing doses and prioritizing patients who stand to gain the most from treatment. Dr. Abdul Rafeh Naqash, a doctor at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma, stated:“The lawmakers in the country need to understand that this is a big problem at this point, where unless something changes in the next few weeks, this can lead to a big national emergency from a patient and health care standpoint.”The shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are the result of a temporary production halt for the U.S. market at an Intas Pharmaceuticals facility in India. Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, pointed out that these shortages highlight a persistent economic issue in the generic drug market. She also noted that the demand for these drugs is expected to increase in the coming years due to an aging population, as older individuals face a higher risk of cancer.In this article, we discuss some of the top cancer stocks to invest in, which include Pfizer Inc.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”10. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of prescription medications.

Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a company involved in the creation, production, and distribution of tools and systems used in the extensive examination of genetic differences and biological functions.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”8. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Next on our list of the best cancer stocks is Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ), which is a biopharmaceutical firm engaged in the discovery, advancement, and distribution of pharmaceutical products to address unmet medical demands worldwide.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”6. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is a global biopharmaceutical company involved in the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of human therapeutics.

(NASDAQ:AMGN), same as the preceding quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares valued at $355.9 million.Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the best cancer stocks to buy.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“In health care we exited global biotechnology company Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Similar to many of its large cap pharma/biotech peers, Amgen is facing patent cliffs for its major drugs in the second half of the decade, while the company’s pipeline has disappointed. In addition, Amgen is facing above-average pricing pressure impacting a number of its current products that compete in crowded therapeutic areas. Amgen is now relying more heavily on acquisitions to address its patent cliff and weak internal pipeline. However, Amgen’s recently proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is being challenged by the FTC, creating further uncertainty.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds10 Best Small-Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Hedge Funds Disclosure: None. 14 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
69,c797361b-6cd1-3357-9d9b-dda4210c9c7b,CCI,2023-10-09,Q4 Stock Predictions: 7 5G Stocks Ready to Roar Into 2024,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q4-stock-predictions-7-5g-110420358.html,1696331060,STORY,"['AVGO', 'SWKS', 'ERIC', 'CCI', 'GLW', 'TMUS', 'NOKIA.HE', 'QRVO']","[As the rollout of 5G, or fifth-generation wireless internet continues, there are many types of 5G stocks you can buy for exposure to this advancement in wireless telecommunications technology.For scores of companies across many areas of the telecom and technology sectors, 5G represents a strong growth opportunity. The companies producing 5G components and hardware will benefit from increased demand for these products.Mass adoption of 5G bodes well for owners of telecommunications infrastructure, namely cell tower real estate investment trusts as well. The telecommunications providers offering 5G service to businesses and consumers stand to benefit as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet while there are many 5G-exposed stocks to choose from, just hone in a few particular names. Yes, stock predictions are not certainties. Possible 5G catalysts may fail to arrive for all of them.However, with the potential upside from the continued rollout of this technology in mind, the coming year could be a banner one for these seven 5G stocks.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comRight now, the main point of interest with mobile chip and infrastructure software company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) may be its growth potential from the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence and other types of AI-related technology.“AI mania” has sent AVGO stock soaring throughout the year. Investors are betting big that the company, especially after it closes on its pending merger deal with VMware (NYSE:VMW), will be well-positioned to capitalize on this particular megatrend.However, the rise of AI is not the only favorable trend in Broadcom’s corner. Broadcom also has much to gain from the 5G trend.Earlier this year, the company renewed a multi-billion dollar deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to provide the iPhone maker with 5G components.Trading for less than 20 times earnings, AVGO appears reasonably priced, given how the aforementioned trends/catalysts could lead to steady earnings growth in the years ahead.Story continuesCrown Castle (CCI)tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITsSource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is one of the leading cell tower REITs. As mentioned above, this sector stands to benefit from the 5G revolution, given the increased need for more cell towers to provide this service.With this, CCI is not any more one of the 5G stocks than the other cell tower REITs.So, why buy CCI stock, as opposed to peers like American Tower (NYSE:AMT) or SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC)? Rising interest rates have hit cell tower REITs considerably hard over the past two years, but with CCI, the de-rating may be overdone.Crown Castle has been pushed to a considerably lower valuation (12.1 times earnings). It sports a much higher dividend yield (6.8%) than AMT or SBAC .While projected growth helps to explain this valuation gap, a modicum of 5G growth could be all it takes for Crown Castle to close this valuation gap.Ericsson (ERIC)Ericsson (ERIC) logo on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSweden-based Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), along with Finland-based Nokia (NYSE:NOK), are benefiting greatly from geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.With the U.S. looking to prevent China’s Huawei from dominating telecom technology in the West, both these companies have the edge when it comes to winning 5G supply deals in the U.S. and its allies.That said, it may be Ericsson’s growth in developing economies that may give it the edge over Nokia. This year, a slowdown in 5G spending stateside has affected both companies. Both ERIC stock and NOK stock tumbled in July, due to weak results and guidance.However, as InvestorPlace’s Alex Sirois pointed out last month, Ericsson is achieving success in faster-growing, less-established 5G markets such as India. Couple this emerging market success with a possible easing of the 5G spending slowdown domestically next year, and ERIC may be better-positioned to positively surprise.Corning (GLW)the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comLike with Ericsson, a slowdown in U.S. 5G spending has weighed on Corning (NYSE:GLW) recently.Shares in the fiber optic cable and display glass company have moved slightly lower so far this year.Yet while a frustrating turn of events for existing GLW stock investors, this pullback gives new investors the opportunity to buy one of the top 5G stocks at a favorable entry point. How so? At current prices, GLW trades for only 16.2 times earnings, and sports a 3.68% forward dividend yield.At the same time, a likely resurgence in 5G capital expenditures, along with a rebound in smartphone demand, gives credence to analyst forecasts calling for Corning’s earnings to bounce back next year, and keep climbing in the years ahead.Investors looking for a 5G play that offers a solid combination of value, growth potential, and yield should look at GLW.Qorvo (QRVO)The logo for Qorvo (QRVO) is shown on a sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comStock predictions for Quorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) aren’t exactly rosy right now. The slump in smartphone demand has the market lukewarm about the prospects of this telecom components maker.However, when it comes to establishing a position, it may be to your advantage that sentiment for QRVO stock is not very bullish.As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, it is likely that this company, not Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), is now providing Apple with a mmWave 5G component used in 5G-enabled iPhones.This points to considerably stronger revenue and earnings in the coming quarters. Analyst consensus already calls for a big earnings rebound, but results could come in much stronger than that. For instance, hitting the high end of analyst forecasts for the next fiscal year (nearly $10 per share) could propel QRVO (in a slump since 2021) back toward all-time highs (nearly $200 per share).Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has held up well during 2023, but investors remain hesitant to bid back shares in this wireless semiconductor company.Similar to Quovo, a slowdown in demand has weighed on Skyworks’ operating performance.Still, I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that SWKS stock has ceased to be one of the best 5G stocks out there. As Morningstar analyst Brian Colello argued in August, issues like software smartphone demand may be persisting, yet these headwinds will clear up over time.SWKS currently trades for 11.7 times earnings. This low valuation suggests that sluggish results are here to stay.However, any sort of growth resurgence could catch the market by surprise, resulting in an outsized move higher for the stock. With this, now may be the perfect time to go contrarian on Skyworks Solutions.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: Shutterstock5G has been heralded as a growth driver for not just T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), but for other wireless carriers like AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as well.However, among the three, TMUS is likely your best bet.Yes, TMUS stock is pricey. Shares trade for 18 times forward earnings, while T and VZ sport forward multiples in the single digits. Both of T-Mobile’s rivals also have high dividend yields, while TMUS does not pay a dividend.However, both these “cheaper” names have performed poorly over the past five years, with both dropping by around 40% over the past five years.In contrast, TMUS has more-than-doubled during this time frame. T-Mobile has been more successful at capitalizing on the 5G trend than “Ma Bell” and Verizon. Likely to stay a winner thanks to competitive advantages, TMUS is the way to play 5G among the telcos.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the AnnouncementMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Barclays just lowered their price target from $150 to $100 as top and bottom line estimates continue to drop.Illumina is on track for barely positive revenue growth this year and EPS projections in the past few months have dropped from $1.40 to $0.83, representing a 60% annual crash.While next year's profits are expected to surge back to EPS of $2.42, there is enough uncertainty still in those numbers -- as margins continue to contract -- to keep institutional investors fleeing the stock since its zenith above $500 two years ago.What's Been Driving the Plummet?As a former Illumina investor in the past year, I watched two elements unfold that created chaos for the company.The first was the bid to re-acquire GRAIL in 2020 after Illumina had spun-off the cancer test developer in 2016, but retained a 12% stake.Regulators in Europe and the U.S. stood in opposition to this move, but Illumina management charged ahead.The second chaos element was that grizzlie corporate raider Carl Icahn getting involved and trashing Illumina management at every turn.Icahn even accused them of spinning out and then reacquiring GRAIL in order to enrich Illumina's directors and executives.For a good timeline of all the drama, see this Reuters article from July which culminates in the EU imposing a $476 million antitrust penalty on the company...Rocky history of Illumina's Grail dealIcahn has certainly succeeded in several ways, including shaking up Illumina management and the board of directors. But he also helped clobber the stock price for himself and other investors. I hope he finds some value now.""Illumina has changed a lot in the last 10 years and is no longer a 20%+ revenue growth stretching-the-bounds-of-science company.""That quote is from Piper Sandler analyst David Westenberg and it captures what I missed when I thought buying Illumina last year near $200 was a good idea.Despite this dour realization, the analyst has maintained his optimism, and as recently as September 5 had an Overweight rating and $275 price target on the shares.In conclusion, here's what I told my Healthcare Innovators member in April when shares had climbed back to $230 and the ""biotech battle royale"" between Icahn and Illumina was getting hot...You might imagine where I stand. While I respect Icahn's prowess to dissect balance sheets, income statements, and management teams to extract more value, how much does his team really know about genomic sequencing and the opportunities ahead that are built on key relationships with research institutions and biotech-focused universities?I tend to favor the scientists here, but that's my bias.Either way, it will be a great battle at the epicenter of Biotech progress to watch.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the oncology industry, head directly to 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.The global oncology landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to discover, develop, and provide innovative treatments aimed at improving outcomes for a growing number of patients. However, the accessibility and utilization of these new cancer medications vary significantly worldwide. According to IQVIA, the number of oncology clinical trials initiated in 2022 remained high, marking a 22% increase since 2018. Over the past five years, there has been a consistent annual rise of 5% in the global population of patients receiving cancer treatment. Projections indicate that global spending on cancer drugs is set to reach $375 billion by 2027, a significant increase from $196 billion in 2022. The oncology portfolio is expanding rapidly, with more than 2,000 products currently in development. A substantial portion of these products, nearly 71%, is being developed by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. These companies have significantly increased their contributions to the development of cancer therapies, up from 51% in 2017. Globally, 237 new active substances have been introduced for cancer treatment over the past two decades, with almost 115 launched within the last five years. The United States has seen 78 NAS launches in the past five years and a total of 189 over the last two decades.The steady rise in cancer treatment can be attributed to aging populations and improved access to healthcare services in developed markets. In lower-income markets, efforts to expand healthcare access and longer treatment durations have led to a higher number of patients receiving cancer treatment each year.As per Fortune Business Insights’ findings, the global market for oncology drugs reached a value of $184.95 billion in 2022. Projections indicate significant growth, with the market expected to increase from $205.52 billion in 2023 to an estimated $484.32 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% during the forecast period. Oncology drugs include a wide range of treatments, including targeted therapies, chemotherapy agents, immunotherapies, and hormone therapies, all developed to combat cancer. Several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including the increasing prevalence of different types of cancer, the approval and launch of new drugs, and improved research efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the oncology field. For instance, as per data released by the American Cancer Society in January, 2023 will see a rise in cancer patients in the United States, with an anticipated 28% increase compared to 2010, resulting in approximately 1.96 million cancer cases by the end of 2023.Story continuesFaced with a severe shortage of over a dozen cancer medications, the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the temporary importation of chemotherapy drugs from international manufacturers not currently approved for distribution in the United States, an FDA spokesperson told CNBC. This potential move aims to address a pressing issue highlighted by medical professionals at hospitals across the country, particularly concerning two drugs – cisplatin and carboplatin, which play a critical role in cancer treatment and are widely utilized. The World Health Organization has recognized the significance of these drugs in basic healthcare. Shortages of these drugs have compelled hospitals to ration their supply by reducing doses and prioritizing patients who stand to gain the most from treatment. Dr. Abdul Rafeh Naqash, a doctor at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma, stated:“The lawmakers in the country need to understand that this is a big problem at this point, where unless something changes in the next few weeks, this can lead to a big national emergency from a patient and health care standpoint.”The shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are the result of a temporary production halt for the U.S. market at an Intas Pharmaceuticals facility in India. Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, pointed out that these shortages highlight a persistent economic issue in the generic drug market. She also noted that the demand for these drugs is expected to increase in the coming years due to an aging population, as older individuals face a higher risk of cancer.In this article, we discuss some of the top cancer stocks to invest in, which include Pfizer Inc.

We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”10. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of prescription medications.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”8. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Next on our list of the best cancer stocks is Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ), which is a biopharmaceutical firm engaged in the discovery, advancement, and distribution of pharmaceutical products to address unmet medical demands worldwide.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”6. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“In health care we exited global biotechnology company Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Similar to many of its large cap pharma/biotech peers, Amgen is facing patent cliffs for its major drugs in the second half of the decade, while the company’s pipeline has disappointed. In addition, Amgen is facing above-average pricing pressure impacting a number of its current products that compete in crowded therapeutic areas. Amgen is now relying more heavily on acquisitions to address its patent cliff and weak internal pipeline. However, Amgen’s recently proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is being challenged by the FTC, creating further uncertainty.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds10 Best Small-Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Hedge Funds Disclosure: None. 14 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Nearly half of parents surveyed said their teenagers were experiencing mental health challenges and one third of parents said their teens struggle with sleep. As a result, more than 25% of parents said their own mental health was negatively impacted and report feeling overwhelmed by their child's emotional challenges.A new report commissioned by The Cigna Group shows that American families are struggling to overcome mental health issues and want community support.""While awareness has grown, barriers to getting mental health care remain for many families – chief among them are knowing where to turn for support and finding the right provider. As conditions like depression, anxiety, and addiction become more pervasive, we need to think differently about how we break down barriers once and for all,"" said David M. Cordani, chairman and CEO, The Cigna Group. ""To curb this crisis and safeguard America's future, we need to work together to equip and empower communities with the support they need to revitalize social connections, strengthen resiliency, and improve health and vitality.""Connecting communities, confronting health inequities U.S. Youth Mental Health Crisis Demands a Community Response is based on Economist Impact research commissioned by The Cigna Group. It shows parents face multiple barriers to supporting family mental health needs including:Not knowing the type of help needed (50%)Difficulty finding a trusted provider (46%)Lack of information about community resources (43%)Lack of support from schools (43%)Nearly half of parents also identified cost of care as a barrier, and children who reside in lower socio-economic households are less likely than those in higher socio-economic households to receive treatment from a mental health provider. Many of the associated social determinants of health, such as safe housing, reliable transportation, parental educational attainment, and job status are considered non-modifiable, and thus communities, employers, and schools are critical for closing gaps in access to mental health treatment.Story continuesTo help combat barriers, The Cigna Group Foundation has invested more than $10.5 million in community mental health organizations through the Healthier Kids For Our Future initiative over the last five years.Activating private sector employers to advance health and well-beingEmployers provide health insurance for 159 million people or 59% of those under the age of 65 – more people in the U.S. than all other forms of coverage. They experience the effects of the mental health crisis every day due to the direct and indirect costs that impact workforce health and productivity. Employers are increasingly looking for innovative approaches to support the health and vitality of employees and their families, optimize productivity, and mitigate unnecessary costs.Four in 10 parents reported a lack of business investment in mental health resources, such as wellness programs and mental health coaching, indicating they may be unaware of existing resources or need types of support not currently available. For example, parents rated community engagement as important as traditional mental health therapy, and many employers could do more to facilitate opportunities for employees and families to do so.""Employers are experiencing the effects of the mental health crisis, as employees strive to deliver at work while also managing family mental health needs,"" said Cordani. ""Given that Gen Z will make up one third of our country's workforce by 2030, we need to do more to secure youth mental health. To do that, we need to view mental health as a collective responsibility between individuals, families, businesses, and community organizations – and work together to help people of all ages thrive.""Read Economist Impact's latest research, commissioned by The Cigna Group: U.S. Youth Mental Health Crisis Demands a Community Response.About The Cigna GroupThe Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) is a global health company committed to creating a better future built on the vitality of every individual and every community. We relentlessly challenge ourselves to partner and innovate solutions for better health.

The companies producing 5G components and hardware will benefit from increased demand for these products.Mass adoption of 5G bodes well for owners of telecommunications infrastructure, namely cell tower real estate investment trusts as well. The telecommunications providers offering 5G service to businesses and consumers stand to benefit as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet while there are many 5G-exposed stocks to choose from, just hone in a few particular names. Yes, stock predictions are not certainties. Possible 5G catalysts may fail to arrive for all of them.However, with the potential upside from the continued rollout of this technology in mind, the coming year could be a banner one for these seven 5G stocks.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comRight now, the main point of interest with mobile chip and infrastructure software company Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) may be its growth potential from the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence and other types of AI-related technology.“AI mania” has sent AVGO stock soaring throughout the year. Investors are betting big that the company, especially after it closes on its pending merger deal with VMware (NYSE:VMW), will be well-positioned to capitalize on this particular megatrend.However, the rise of AI is not the only favorable trend in Broadcom’s corner. Broadcom also has much to gain from the 5G trend.Earlier this year, the company renewed a multi-billion dollar deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to provide the iPhone maker with 5G components.Trading for less than 20 times earnings, AVGO appears reasonably priced, given how the aforementioned trends/catalysts could lead to steady earnings growth in the years ahead.Story continuesCrown Castle (CCI)tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITsSource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is one of the leading cell tower REITs. As mentioned above, this sector stands to benefit from the 5G revolution, given the increased need for more cell towers to provide this service.With this, CCI is not any more one of the 5G stocks than the other cell tower REITs.So, why buy CCI stock, as opposed to peers like American Tower (NYSE:AMT) or SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC)? Rising interest rates have hit cell tower REITs considerably hard over the past two years, but with CCI, the de-rating may be overdone.Crown Castle has been pushed to a considerably lower valuation (12.1 times earnings). It sports a much higher dividend yield (6.8%) than AMT or SBAC .While projected growth helps to explain this valuation gap, a modicum of 5G growth could be all it takes for Crown Castle to close this valuation gap.Ericsson (ERIC)Ericsson (ERIC) logo on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSweden-based Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), along with Finland-based Nokia (NYSE:NOK), are benefiting greatly from geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.With the U.S. looking to prevent China’s Huawei from dominating telecom technology in the West, both these companies have the edge when it comes to winning 5G supply deals in the U.S. and its allies.That said, it may be Ericsson’s growth in developing economies that may give it the edge over Nokia. This year, a slowdown in 5G spending stateside has affected both companies. Both ERIC stock and NOK stock tumbled in July, due to weak results and guidance.However, as InvestorPlace’s Alex Sirois pointed out last month, Ericsson is achieving success in faster-growing, less-established 5G markets such as India. Couple this emerging market success with a possible easing of the 5G spending slowdown domestically next year, and ERIC may be better-positioned to positively surprise.Corning (GLW)the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comLike with Ericsson, a slowdown in U.S. 5G spending has weighed on Corning (NYSE:GLW) recently.Shares in the fiber optic cable and display glass company have moved slightly lower so far this year.Yet while a frustrating turn of events for existing GLW stock investors, this pullback gives new investors the opportunity to buy one of the top 5G stocks at a favorable entry point. How so? At current prices, GLW trades for only 16.2 times earnings, and sports a 3.68% forward dividend yield.At the same time, a likely resurgence in 5G capital expenditures, along with a rebound in smartphone demand, gives credence to analyst forecasts calling for Corning’s earnings to bounce back next year, and keep climbing in the years ahead.Investors looking for a 5G play that offers a solid combination of value, growth potential, and yield should look at GLW.Qorvo (QRVO)The logo for Qorvo (QRVO) is shown on a sign outside the company's headquarters.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comStock predictions for Quorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) aren’t exactly rosy right now. The slump in smartphone demand has the market lukewarm about the prospects of this telecom components maker.However, when it comes to establishing a position, it may be to your advantage that sentiment for QRVO stock is not very bullish.As a Seeking Alpha commentator argued last month, it is likely that this company, not Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), is now providing Apple with a mmWave 5G component used in 5G-enabled iPhones.This points to considerably stronger revenue and earnings in the coming quarters. Analyst consensus already calls for a big earnings rebound, but results could come in much stronger than that. For instance, hitting the high end of analyst forecasts for the next fiscal year (nearly $10 per share) could propel QRVO (in a slump since 2021) back toward all-time highs (nearly $200 per share).Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) has held up well during 2023, but investors remain hesitant to bid back shares in this wireless semiconductor company.Similar to Quovo, a slowdown in demand has weighed on Skyworks’ operating performance.Still, I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that SWKS stock has ceased to be one of the best 5G stocks out there. As Morningstar analyst Brian Colello argued in August, issues like software smartphone demand may be persisting, yet these headwinds will clear up over time.SWKS currently trades for 11.7 times earnings. This low valuation suggests that sluggish results are here to stay.However, any sort of growth resurgence could catch the market by surprise, resulting in an outsized move higher for the stock. With this, now may be the perfect time to go contrarian on Skyworks Solutions.T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: Shutterstock5G has been heralded as a growth driver for not just T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), but for other wireless carriers like AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as well.However, among the three, TMUS is likely your best bet.Yes, TMUS stock is pricey. Shares trade for 18 times forward earnings, while T and VZ sport forward multiples in the single digits. Both of T-Mobile’s rivals also have high dividend yields, while TMUS does not pay a dividend.However, both these “cheaper” names have performed poorly over the past five years, with both dropping by around 40% over the past five years.In contrast, TMUS has more-than-doubled during this time frame. T-Mobile has been more successful at capitalizing on the 5G trend than “Ma Bell” and Verizon. Likely to stay a winner thanks to competitive advantages, TMUS is the way to play 5G among the telcos.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the AnnouncementMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

David Solomon is trying to quell internal unrest at Goldman Sachs (GS) as he refocuses the bank on its core strengths. Charles Scharf is trying to move Wells Fargo (WFC) beyond old legal troubles that won’t go away.There is a lot of scrutiny surrounding some of the nation’s biggest bank CEOs as they navigate through one of the most challenging periods for their industry since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.What they all have in common are macro pressures from high interest rates, new capital requirements, and shrinking margins, as well as the sort of political heat they haven’t faced in some time. Bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.In December eight of these big-bank CEOs will appear before the Senate Banking Committee to face the sort of grilling that was commonplace following the 2008 crisis. That includes JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman.Some of the biggest bank CEOs are headed back to Washington in December for a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Here Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, center, and others testify in 2022. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)These banks ""hold too much power in the economy,"" Committee Chair and Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said in a statement about the December hearing.Some of these big-bank CEOs are under more immediate heat than others. Here is a look at three:Citigroup CEO Jane FraserFraser, hoping to revive a stock price that trails rivals and remove decades of bloat, is making what she called the ""most consequential"" change to how Citi operates in nearly two decades.Instead of operating with two mega-divisions, she is splitting the bank into five separate units with leaders reporting directly to her. She has made it clear this will mean fewer people.""We'll be saying goodbye to some very talented and hard-working colleagues,"" Fraser wrote when she announced the moves in September.Story continuesCiti has made sweeping restructuring announcements before, under Fraser’s predecessors.“Here we go again, one more Citi restructuring,” said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo. “Why is this time different?""Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)But the big difference this time is that Fraser is “removing the middle layer” of management that initially reported to the bank’s CEO, according to a Citi spokesperson.Fraser took over Citi as CEO in 2021, long after the bank began to lag peers. Since her tenure began, the stock has fallen 30%, twice the decline of any other big bank in that time.From the beginning of 2023, the stock has declined 22%, continuing the trend. It closed Friday at $40.6, its lowest price in more than three years. The bank's return on tangible equity was 6.8% as of last quarter, lower than its five other big-bank rivals.The next wave of changes and potential layoffs will be announced sometime in November before Thanksgiving when the 150 to 200 people who report to a member of the executive management team must also make some eliminations.Citi has not yet provided actual figures for the reduction in head count or expenses but it will likely offer more detail during the release of third quarter earnings on Oct. 13 about how the reorganization will bring down costs. The actual head count number will be released early in 2024.""We have taken hard, consequential, tough decisions here,"" Fraser said while speaking at a September conference about the changes. ""They are not going to be universally popular within our bank. It's going to make some of our people very uncomfortable. I am absolutely fine with that.""Goldman CEO David SolomonPerhaps no big-bank CEO has attracted more public scrutiny than Solomon, who this past summer had to announce the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with media reports about his leadership style, job cuts, and reports of partner unrest.Under Solomon the bank is attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer lending while it waits out a tepid period of dealmaking.The good news is that the IPO market does seem to be thawing following a series of new offerings last month involving Goldman. And Goldman's lead board director ""seemed very supportive"" of Solomon in a recent meeting with Mayo, who published a note last month stating that Solomon ""is not going anywhere anytime soon.""David Solomon, Goldman's CEO. (Lucy Nicholson/REUTERS) (Lucy Nicholson / Reuters)The meeting ""leads us to conclude that the CEO will stay in his role for at least the medium term,” Mayo said in his note titled ""CEO Stays—No Ifs, ands, or buts.""Solomon told investors last month that the Wall Street giant ""is making a lot of progress, and we feel very good about where we are"" as the company navigates a series of challenges in 2023. He warned of ""some impairments and marks in commercial real estate"" in the firm's third quarter earnings.Since Solomon took over Goldman in 2018, the stock has risen 39%, outperforming all of its peers except rival Morgan Stanley.Since the beginning of 2023, Goldman’s stock is down 10%, underperforming Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan while outperforming Bank of America and Citigroup. Its return on tangible equity is 7% as of last quarter, second worst among six giant banks.Next year, he added while speaking at a Barclays conference in New York, ""should be a better year for sure.""Wells Fargo CEO Charles ScharfScharf, who took over Wells Fargo in 2019, is trying to shake the problems of the past. That is proving to be a challenge.The CEO took over in 2019, well after a fake-accounts scandal roiled the San Francisco lender and damaged its reputation.Wells Fargo &amp; Company president and CEO Charles Scharf. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)The bank is still operating under a 2018 order from the Federal Reserve that placed a cap on its total assets, a sanction designed to punish Wells Fargo for its risk-management miscues.And there have been new surprises, too. In December of last year it reached a $3.7 billion settlement including customer remediations with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on allegations that it illegally overcharged 16 million customers on their auto loans and mortgages.Since the fake-accounts scandal it has paid out $12.9 billion in penalties, settlements and customer remediations, $235 million of which came in August, according to the left of center watchdog group Good Jobs First.""We remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete,"" Scharf told investors during the bank's second quarter earnings call in July.Since Scharf took over Wells Fargo in 2019, the stock has fallen 19%, underperforming all but Citigroup. Since the beginning of 2023, Wells Fargo’s stock is down 5%, outperforming all but JPMorgan Chase.Its return on tangible equity is 10.3% as of last quarter, better than Citigroup and Goldman but trailing JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.""The company continues at a very moderated pace to make improvement, but we don't see a game changer here,"" said Ken Leon, a big bank analyst with CFRA who recently changed his rating on the stock from Buy to Hold.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the oncology industry, head directly to 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.The global oncology landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to discover, develop, and provide innovative treatments aimed at improving outcomes for a growing number of patients. However, the accessibility and utilization of these new cancer medications vary significantly worldwide. According to IQVIA, the number of oncology clinical trials initiated in 2022 remained high, marking a 22% increase since 2018. Over the past five years, there has been a consistent annual rise of 5% in the global population of patients receiving cancer treatment. Projections indicate that global spending on cancer drugs is set to reach $375 billion by 2027, a significant increase from $196 billion in 2022. The oncology portfolio is expanding rapidly, with more than 2,000 products currently in development. A substantial portion of these products, nearly 71%, is being developed by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. These companies have significantly increased their contributions to the development of cancer therapies, up from 51% in 2017. Globally, 237 new active substances have been introduced for cancer treatment over the past two decades, with almost 115 launched within the last five years. The United States has seen 78 NAS launches in the past five years and a total of 189 over the last two decades.The steady rise in cancer treatment can be attributed to aging populations and improved access to healthcare services in developed markets. In lower-income markets, efforts to expand healthcare access and longer treatment durations have led to a higher number of patients receiving cancer treatment each year.As per Fortune Business Insights’ findings, the global market for oncology drugs reached a value of $184.95 billion in 2022. Projections indicate significant growth, with the market expected to increase from $205.52 billion in 2023 to an estimated $484.32 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% during the forecast period. Oncology drugs include a wide range of treatments, including targeted therapies, chemotherapy agents, immunotherapies, and hormone therapies, all developed to combat cancer. Several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including the increasing prevalence of different types of cancer, the approval and launch of new drugs, and improved research efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the oncology field. For instance, as per data released by the American Cancer Society in January, 2023 will see a rise in cancer patients in the United States, with an anticipated 28% increase compared to 2010, resulting in approximately 1.96 million cancer cases by the end of 2023.Story continuesFaced with a severe shortage of over a dozen cancer medications, the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the temporary importation of chemotherapy drugs from international manufacturers not currently approved for distribution in the United States, an FDA spokesperson told CNBC. This potential move aims to address a pressing issue highlighted by medical professionals at hospitals across the country, particularly concerning two drugs – cisplatin and carboplatin, which play a critical role in cancer treatment and are widely utilized. The World Health Organization has recognized the significance of these drugs in basic healthcare. Shortages of these drugs have compelled hospitals to ration their supply by reducing doses and prioritizing patients who stand to gain the most from treatment. Dr. Abdul Rafeh Naqash, a doctor at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma, stated:“The lawmakers in the country need to understand that this is a big problem at this point, where unless something changes in the next few weeks, this can lead to a big national emergency from a patient and health care standpoint.”The shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are the result of a temporary production halt for the U.S. market at an Intas Pharmaceuticals facility in India. Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, pointed out that these shortages highlight a persistent economic issue in the generic drug market. She also noted that the demand for these drugs is expected to increase in the coming years due to an aging population, as older individuals face a higher risk of cancer.In this article, we discuss some of the top cancer stocks to invest in, which include Pfizer Inc.

We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”10. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN), a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the research, development, manufacturing, and distribution of prescription medications.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”8.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”6. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Amgen Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“In health care we exited global biotechnology company Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN). Similar to many of its large cap pharma/biotech peers, Amgen is facing patent cliffs for its major drugs in the second half of the decade, while the company’s pipeline has disappointed. In addition, Amgen is facing above-average pricing pressure impacting a number of its current products that compete in crowded therapeutic areas.

80,08a5c874-155c-3242-83c7-c9c3625a30cb,PFE,2023-10-09,Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.41,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-nyse-pfe-affirmed-dividend-121556712.html,1696767356,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.41 per share on 4th of December. This makes the dividend yield 5.0%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Pfizer was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 16.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 55%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.64. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.4% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.Pfizer May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, Pfizer's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 0.04% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.Our Thoughts On Pfizer's DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Pfizer's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies in Canada.Innovation comes with years of research and experimentation. Canadian inventors are pioneers of some of the notable innovations of the modern age such as universal standard time in 1883, peanut butter in 1884, and insulin in 1922 - to name a few. These innovations have had a vital impact in their respective industries and are still in use today. Canada, being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has the capacity to drive innovation across different industries and markets. Canada is the eighth wealthiest country in the world with a total net worth of $11.26 trillion, accumulating a global wealth share of 2.5%, as per Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report of 2023. While the wealth per capita is around $369,577, one of the highest in the world. Since 2012, Canada’s wealth has grown by 44.54%, as of 2022. Canada's Economic OutlookThe developed global economies have struggled in 2023 due to a rise in inflation and interest rates. Canada has suffered from aggressive monetary tightening in recent times, which has harmed the GDP. According to Deloitte's economic outlook for Canada, the country's real GDP dropped by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2023. The GDP per capita is expected to resume growth by the end of 2024. Deloitte forecasts the Canadian economy to end 2023 with a growth of 1% and record 0.9% gains in 2024. At the same time, the IMF reports Canadian real GDP growth at 1.5%. In the near term, the Canadian economy will continue to suffer from economic downturns, but some positives will help economic stability in the longer term. In 2023, Delottile expects consumer spending to grow at 2% and slightly slow down to 1.2% in 2024. Overall, Deloitte projects the Bank of Canada to improve its monetary policy and expects the Canadian economy to resume growth in 2024. The Canadian economy is expected to have a tough start at the beginning of the new year and gradually return to growth in the latter half of 2024. The Bank of Canada is expected to end its tightening campaign and should reverse its recent hikes by the next spring, as per Deloitte. Story continuesApart from ongoing economic instability, the Canadian economy has evolved over the years. According to Statistics Canada, the Canadian economy has grown by almost 103% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest growth among the G-7 economies, as of 2022. The Canadian government says that they are well positioned to overcome the ongoing economic crises. Statistics Canada highlighted the Canadian government's point of view:“Our economy entered 2023 on a better footing than most of our peers, and with strong economic fundamentals, including robust population growth, a strong labour market, and a well-regulated and well-capitalized financial system, Canada will be able to weather a global economic slowdown.”For businesses, supply chain issues have eased after the COVID-19 pandemic, with acquiring domestic inputs and maintaining inventories helping in normalization. According to Statistics Canada’s latest Canadian Survey on Business Conditions (CSBC), higher interest rates, inflation rates, borrowing costs, and debt constraints, have had a negative impact on businesses. The sectors with the most optimistic outlook are wholesale, recreation, and manufacturing, while optimism is lowest for transportation, construction, and oil and gas. As per SCBC, business optimism is highest in Quebec at 79% and the Territories at over 70%. Ontario and British Columbia are at the bottom of the list with business optimism of 59% and 63%, respectively. Business Innovation in Canada According to Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the Canadian population involved in entrepreneurship grew more than 50% over the last 10 years. Around 20% of the adult population was planning or starting a business in Canada in 2021. On July 24, Statistics Canada revealed that the government of Canada has announced a $3.3 million investment to support 100 newcomer entrepreneurs in southern Ontario. The Toronto Business Development Centre (TBDC) will guide new entrepreneurs to support innovation and growth across different business ideas. The Canadian government is not only providing financial support to new entrepreneurs, but it is also guiding them with mentorship and other required resources to scale their businesses. Canada is one of the best countries for investment as it offers investors preferential market access via 14 trade agreements with 49 countries, comprising a market of 1.5 billion consumers. In addition, 98% of EU tariffs are duty-free for Canadian goods through mutual agreements. Businesses in Canada are shifting towards online payments due to various reasons. As per SCBC, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) accounts for almost 7% of total business payments in Canada and it is expected to cross 10% in the next 12 months. On September 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) announced that PayPal Giving Fund is expanding its collaboration with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to allow charitable funding on Facebook and Instagram in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. On September 28, CNW Group reported that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been added as a new payment option by Staples Canada. With the increasing use of online payments, businesses in Canada are switching towards online payment providers and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains a top provider among them. Apart from a large volume shifting towards e-payments, Canada is also progressing swiftly in the clean energy sector. On May 22, CTV News reported that Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) signed an 11-year deal with a Quebec-based battery manufacturer, Nemaska Lithium. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will potentially purchase 13,000 tons of lithium hydroxide per year from Nemaska Lithium. With this deal, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) became the first US automaker customer of Nemaska Lithium.Similarly, the German automaker, Volkswagen AG (XETRA:VOW) is making an historic investment in Canada. On April 21, CBC reported that Volkswagen AG (XETRA:VOW) will be investing $7 billion to set up its first overseas EV battery manufacturing plant in St. Thomas, Ontario. The construction of the plant is expected to begin in 2024 and is planned to be completed in 2027. The EV battery manufacturing plant in Ontario will be Volkswagen AG's (XETRA:VOW) largest plant to date, which will create around 3,000 direct jobs and 30,000 indirect jobs. Volkswagen AG’s (XETRA:VOW) plant investment will be the largest EV-related investment in Canada, which is a strong development for the Canadian EV industry. Canadian companies continue to expand their businesses across multiple sectors. Canadian media giant Thomson Reuters Corporation (TSE:TRI) is one of the leading media houses in the world. On August 17, Thomson Reuters Corporation (TSE:TRI) announced the acquisition of Casetext for $650 million. Just like many other companies, Thomson Reuters Corporation (TSE:TRI) is working on generative AI to provide advanced solutions. During the earnings call of the second quarter of 2023, the company pointed to strengthening its generative AI capabilities. Here are some of the comments from Thomson Reuters Corporation (TSE:TRI) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Looking forward, our confidence around the generative AI opportunity continues to strengthen. We made good progress against our build, partner, buy approach in the second quarter with organic builds progressing and announcements of both an intelligent drafting solution with Microsoft and our intention to acquire Casetext. Since discussing AI on our Q1 call, our conviction around our opportunity to leverage generative AI has strengthened. As a result, we’re accelerating our investment in the short term as we work to leverage these exciting capabilities for the benefit of our professional markets. Our capital capacity and liquidity remain a key asset that we are focused on deploying to create shareholder value. And we made good progress on this during the second quarter.”Let’s have a look at the companies that are innovating the Canadian economy through their developments across different sectors.15 Most Innovative Companies in CanadaToronto, CanadaOur MethodologyTo obtain data for the most innovative companies in Canada, we took data from different publications including PwC, Arcus Group, and Canadian Business. We took the top ten companies from each source to compile our list of the 30 most innovative companies in Canada first.We then calculated the 10-year stock returns of all public companies in our initial list, as of September 27. We hypothesized that a company with higher stock returns has been at the forefront of innovation. We narrowed down our selection to companies that had the highest stock returns and ranked them in ascending order of this metric.We also considered private companies and we ranked them based on their total funding. Our hypothesis for private companies is that more capital indicates more innovation.The public companies with stock returns are ranked higher than private companies with total funding amounts, and among the private companies, the ones with the highest total funding are ranked higher. We sourced and cross checked the data for total funding from Crunchbase, Growjo, and Tracxn. An important note: Shopify Inc.’s (TSE:SHOP) data was available from May 2015, therefore its stock returns are from the last eight years. Here is the list of the 15 most innovative companies in Canada.15 Most Innovative Companies in Canada15.

Tourism makes up 3.6% of total employment, according to OECD data.U.S. cruise operators Royal Caribbean and Carnival said they ""adjusted"" their itineraries in the Israel area.

We've been getting a lot of inquiries about safety,"" said Matt Berna, Americas President of Intrepid Travel, a group tour and travel company.Regulators including the FAA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Israel's aviation authority urged airlines to use caution in the region's airspace, but stopped short of suspending flights.Israel's civil aviation authority asked airlines to ""review current security and threat information"" amid the conflict, and changed some air traffic routes.

The stocks have sunk again. The Regional Bank ETF (KRE) is down 10% over the last month. Some banks are even returning to their 52-week lows.Is this a buying opportunity in the banks?Value or Value Trap?Just because a stock sells off, or hits 52-week lows, doesn't mean it's a value. Additionally, just because a company has cheap fundamentals, like a low P/E or P/S ratio, that doesn't mean it's always a value.The key to finding true value stocks lies in the earnings.Are earnings on the decline or on the rise? Are analysts raising earnings estimates or are they cutting them? A company can have a dirt-cheap P/E but if earnings are falling off a cliff, that does not mean that company is a deal.Earnings are key to determining whether a company is a value or a trap.5 Bank Stocks: Values or Traps?1.       Bank OZK OZKBank OZK is a regional bank headquartered in Arkansas.

93,cbca8280-dcc1-38ec-a6ce-c767cbdde7a1,PNW,2023-10-09,Pinnacle West Capital's (NYSE:PNW) investors will be pleased with their 24% return over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinnacle-west-capitals-nyse-pnw-104543500.html,1696848343,STORY,['PNW'],"[While Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 12% in the last quarter. But over the last year the share price action has been satisfactory. Indeed the stock is up 18% over twelve months, compared to a market return of about 18%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 1 year and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last twelve months, Pinnacle West Capital actually shrank its EPS by 26%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We note that the most recent dividend payment is higher than the payment a year ago, so that may have assisted the share price. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield, pushing the price up in the process. Though we must add that the revenue growth of 15% year on year would have helped paint a pretty picture.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Pinnacle West Capital's TSR for the last 1 year was 24%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Pinnacle West Capital has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 24% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 1.7%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Pinnacle West Capital better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Pinnacle West Capital (2 make us uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.Of course Pinnacle West Capital may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of growth stocks.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

94,46d6c1a1-d80b-3933-a9c8-bf1d7e488863,TGT,2023-10-09,Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 81% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporation-nyse-tgt-largely-105236804.html,1696848756,STORY,['TGT'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Target's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 21 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Target, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Target already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Target's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Target. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 21 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Target Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$127m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Target   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

96,800a8414-bc61-3c12-a21b-cd45b219a76d,MAR,2023-10-09,Stephanie Linnartz ended a successful run at Marriott to become CEO at struggling Under Armour. ‘I believe in taking calculated risks’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stephanie-linnartz-ended-successful-run-100000086.html,1696845600,STORY,"['MAR', 'UAA']","[Imagine that you grow up, literally, in the hotel industry. Your parents run an iconic pub and boutique hotel in Washington, D.C., where you spend your teenage summers cleaning rooms and working the checkout desk. After college, you intern at Hilton, go to business school, and then join the finance department of Marriott International, the largest hotel company in the world.Over the next 25 years, you rise through the ranks to become one of Marriott’s most senior executives, and its highest-ranking woman, telling Fortune in 2015 that “anyone can make it to the top here if you work really hard.” And by 2021, when you’re named one of two executives sharing the duties of acting CEO and likely in line to become the next chief executive, it seems like your lifelong devotion to this industry is about to pay off.And then you don’t get the job. What do you do next?For Stephanie Linnartz—the former president of Marriott, and now the CEO of struggling sportswear company Under Armour—the answer was: Find one of the biggest turnaround jobs out there, and get back to work.“Why things happen, we don’t ever know for sure,” she tells me during an interview at the new corner office that she’s still settling into, overlooking Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. “But life’s all about timing—and I always had this idea that the rewards of taking risks are, the great majority of the time, worth it.”On the surface, Linnartz’s decision to jump to a bro-y sportswear retailer seems like an odd fit for an executive who’s spent her career in luxury hotels. It even required a personal-style pivot: At Marriott, “I wore dresses and high heels every day,” she reminisces, but during our interview she sports her new executive uniform of Under Armour sneakers and a white zip-up jacket. And the challenges go far beyond fashion. Linnartz is several months into what she has called a three-year turnaround plan, for a once-buzzy brand that has seen its growth stagnate and share price plummet in the past decade. (Under Armour is also a much smaller company, with only $5.9 billion in revenue and 15,000 employees, to Marriott’s $20.8 billion and 140,000.) And she’s coming in as an outsider to a founder-dominated company still controlled by executive chairman Kevin Plank, four years and three chief executives after he “stepped down” from his CEO role.Story continues“She obviously has an important voice and an important role, and I’m sure that she will exert influence,” says Neil Saunders, a GlobalData Retail analyst who covers Under Armour. But “it’s very difficult, when you have someone who founded the business and still has very strong views about the business, calling some of the shots.”Still, Linnartz wanted to be a chief executive—and when the obvious path to that role closed at Marriott, she followed the advice she’s given to many other women over the years. “Take the toughest, most difficult job or project someone can give you, because that’s how you move ahead,” is how Linnartz characterized her career philosophy to Fortune eight years ago.Her new job certainly seems to fit the bill. “There are challenges,” she acknowledges. “And we’ll face them.” Under Armour, as even its employees admit, has been in trouble for a long time.Plank started the company in his grandmother’s basement in 1996, as I was told multiple times by multiple people over the course of three hours at Under Armour headquarters in August. He was inspired by his time playing college football for the University of Maryland, where he regularly sweated through cotton shirts ill-equipped to handle an athlete’s perspiration. His startup first defined itself as a founder-led seller of performance gear, one that today has a team of employees devoted to developing “revolutionary yarn” and that boasts about using “over 10,000 fabrics in our history”—most of them optimized to reduce the amount of sweat you have to deal with while performing very sweat-heavy physical feats.And for a while, Under Armour was cool. It won endorsements and signed deals with a wide range of high schools, colleges, and professional athletes, including heavy hitters: NBA superstar Steph Curry, college football powerhouse Notre Dame, even professional ballerina Misty Copeland. In 2005, less than 10 years in, Under Armour went public, successfully—its shares doubled within the first day of trading, making it the first U.S. company in five years to have such a pop. The share price peaked at a split-adjusted high of $52 in 2015, as the company’s annual revenues were soaring by 28%.But in 2023, Under Armour is struggling to grow sales or profits, and its shares are trading around $6.50. The company hasn’t accumulated the sneakerhead cred or ongoing athlete endorsements of Nike and Adidas, and its historical focus on performance, rather than fashion, has made Under Armour a lagging player in the pandemic-era athleisure boom that turned Lululemon into a juggernaut. Deadspin recently called it the “worst sports apparel company of the past 20 years,” and analysts concur that it’s “a second-tier brand,” as Saunders says. “What’s gone wrong with Under Armour is what’s always been wrong: Under Armour doesn’t really know what it is.”–87%Change in Under Armour's share price since its 2015 peak. As of 9/21/23Without many of its own stores, and without the high-polish e-commerce reputation of younger competitors, Under Armour sits in an awkward retail spot. It still relies too much on third-party retailers to sell its stuff, something that Linnartz and other executives acknowledge has led to an “inconsistent” reputation in the U.S.: Today, Under Armour might be best described as something that teenage boys’ moms buy for them, on sale, at Kohl’s. But for the woman who jumped into this turnaround job, “there’s tremendous upside,” Linnartz claims. “There’s incredible love for the brand, globally—and so I’m super excited about it.”The oldest of six children in an Irish American family, Linnartz grew up in northern Virginia—not far from the Maryland headquarters of Marriott and now Under Armour. One brother still runs the Dubliner pub, a Capitol Hill hangout that has hosted U.S. presidents and Irish ambassadors as well as plenty of locals and tourists. In person, Linnartz doesn’t come across as a chatty publican’s daughter—she’s warm but brisk, and deftly swats most questions back toward her corporate talking points. But she’s inherited a relish for focusing on customers’ experiences. She also has an affinity for complex challenges. As she climbed the ranks at Marriott, she became known for taking on projects “that were lying in plain sight, that were hard, and that needed to be tackled,” says Jim Dausch, Marriott’s former chief product and digital officer, who in June left the hotel chain after 20 years to reunite with Linnartz as Under Armour’s chief consumer officer.For example, after Marriott purchased Starwood in 2016 for $13 billion, Linnartz oversaw the massive integration between two operating systems, including the customer-loyalty programs that are so crucial for repeat business in the hospitality industry. She ultimately built its Marriott Bonvoy rewards platform, now the world’s largest such hospitality program, with 186 million members. And according to Dausch, she also kick-started a complicated and expensive overhaul of the back-end tech behind Marriott’s disparate systems. That project was becoming more high-stakes as the company expanded into all-inclusive resorts and residences and other operations, but it was one where “the company had always kind of kicked the can down the road,” Dausch says. “After the Starwood integration was over, Stephanie was the one to say, ‘We have to take this on’ … She really led that charge.”Linnartz, with Steph Curry and Under Armour employees, hopes to expand the company’s presence in “athleisure” and female-focused clothing.The last few years of Linnartz’s tenure at Marriott were overshadowed by global and personal tragedies. The pandemic upended the hotel industry; Marriott laid off tens of thousands of workers and shed $10 billion in revenue in 2020, as travel ground to a halt. At the same time, its widely respected CEO, Arne Sorenson, was fighting pancreatic cancer. In February 2021, he stepped back from running the company, which said that Linnartz and fellow top executive Tony Capuano would take over his day-to-day responsibilities. Two weeks later, Sorenson died—and before the end of the month, Marriott’s board announced that Capuano would be the next CEO. Linnartz was named president, in charge of running global consumer strategy, as well as development, technology, and emerging business.Hospitality insiders praise Capuano, a veteran development executive under whom Marriott’s stock has risen more than 31%. But some mourn the symbolic missed opportunity of Linnartz not getting the CEO role, in a relatively small travel industry where only 30% of senior executives are female and very few run large hotel or airline companies. “I think most women in the industry were disappointed that it wasn’t a woman,” says Flo Lugli, a hotel industry consultant and former senior executive at Wyndham and Radisson. “But Marriott has a great reputation of developing good leaders.”For almost two more years, Linnartz was a good soldier. But “I’ve always been a big believer in taking risk, and saying, ‘How can I grow myself as a leader and a human being?’ ” she says. When one CEO left Under Armour in June 2022 and the board started looking for a permanent replacement, “I was ready to take that next leap.”A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. And there’s another way in which her résumé has prepared her for some of the company’s challenges: At Marriott, which is still 16% owned by the eponymous Marriott family and where the founders’ descendants still very much have a voice, Sorenson in 2012 became the first non-family CEO in the company’s then-85-year history.So Linnartz knows how to work for a company where keeping the founder happy is part of the job. The challenge, with Under Armour, will be doing so while cleaning up some of the problems created on his watch. Plank—or “KP,” as longtime employees call him—occupied the CEO’s office for 24 years. His origin story is still fetishized, to a near-cultish degree, at headquarters: Buildings and apparel lines are numbered either 96 (for the year he founded Under Armour) or 37 (for the number of KP’s college football jersey). One corridor at headquarters is decorated with an enormous photo of that jersey, next to blown-up versions of Plank’s early Under Armour business cards, next to #inspo phrases like “HUMBLE &amp; HUNGRY BEGINNINGS.”For a long time, Plank was Under Armour’s best brand ambassador—until he started landing the company in the middle of ugly controversies. In 2017, he publicly praised President Trump—to the vocal displeasure of Under Armour’s celebrity spokespeople, including Curry and Copeland—before reversing course and resigning from the president’s business council over Trump’s response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Then, in 2018, the Wall Street Journal broke a series of stories on inappropriate workplace behavior and a sexualized culture at Under Armour; Plank and his executives even attended company-paid trips to strip clubs, the Journal reported. And in 2021, the company agreed to pay $9 million to settle an SEC investigation into financial disclosure failures dating back six years. At the beginning of 2020, Plank nominally stepped down from leading Under Armour, keeping his “executive chairman” role and naming company president Patrik Frisk CEO.Founder Kevin Plank remains Under Armour’s controlling shareholder.But as several chief executives elsewhere in the corporate world have discovered to their dismay in recent months, “executive chair” often means “CEO by any other name.” Frisk, interim CEO Colin Browne, and now Linnartz have all reported to Plank, who owns 65% of Under Armour’s voting shares. And outside the boardroom, KP’s public profile continues to create headaches; two days before I interviewed Linnartz for this article, unsealed court documents in a six-year-old shareholder lawsuit revealed that Plank had shared nonpublic financial information with television journalist Stephanie Ruhle. The revelations of the inappropriate-at-best relationship made widespread, gossipy headlines.“I don’t tolerate gossip—and for many people here, this is old news,” says Linnartz, adding that her approach involved “leaving some of the noise aside, that has nothing to do with the business, to focus on what is terrific about Kevin, and inspiring as only a founder can be.”Plank, for his part, declined multiple interview requests for this article. A spokesperson said that he was traveling, and sent along an emailed statement calling Linnartz “the obvious choice” for CEO. “She has hit the ground running, launching a clearly articulated three-year strategy that sets us up for strategic growth,” Plank wrote. “I could not be more excited to have her at Under Armour and to work with her every day.”However Linnartz navigates her relationship with her executive chairman over the coming months, she has plenty of cautionary tales. Recent years have given us several examples of ambitious, experienced executives—often women—who take on a CEO job that involves working for a predecessor or founder, and trying to keep him happy while fixing some of the problems he created. There’s Linda Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal executive who’s now enthusiastically embracing whatever Elon Musk has turned Twitter into. There’s Roz Brewer, the former Starbucks chief operating officer who became Walgreens CEO in 2021—and who abruptly left in late August, after two and a half years of working for Stefano Pessina, the executive chairman and largest shareholder at Walgreens. And there’s Sonia Syngal, whose 2022 exit from Gap Inc. came after two years of trying to turn around a retailer that’s more than 40% owned by its founding family. (The departures of Syngal and Brewer, who had been one of only two Black female CEOs running a Fortune 500 company, also represented losses specifically for women of color.)A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. “There’s incredible love for the brand,” she says.Everyone has a boss to keep happy—even ridiculously well-compensated CEOs—and the vagaries of working for the guy you’re supposedly replacing aren’t always gendered. But it’s striking how many ambitious women, still, have to take such risks in order to get a shot at the top spot in corporate America, where women account for barely 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs. The career choices made by Brewer, Yaccarino, and potentially Linnartz also raise questions about how much executives still have to navigate the “glass cliff,” the data-backed phenomenon in which women have to accept riskier opportunities in order to advance.So is this the tightrope Linnartz is walking at Under Armour? Probably—but “I don’t focus on that,” Linnartz says. “I believe in taking calculated risks. I don’t believe in being reckless.” And according to her friends and colleagues, she has the work ethic—and the courage—to pull Under Armour and her career back from this potential brink.“She’s very data-driven, she’s got great judgment, and she doesn’t underestimate” how much work something will be, says Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, No. 2 on this year’s Fortune Most Powerful Women list, who got to know Linnartz through her company’s consulting work for Marriott. (Under Armour has also been an Accenture client.)“She knows what the challenges are,” Sweet adds, “and she’s going to absolutely overcome them.”Six months in, Linnartz has already taken some pages from the hospitality-industry playbook—especially her experience pulling in Starwood’s beloved loyalty program, and creating Marriott Bonvoy. In July, Under Armour launched a UA Rewards program that Linnartz argues is about getting customers more excited about Under Armour—by promising them access to sports tickets or special events with celebrity athletes or early entry to sneaker launches—as much as it is about pushing merchandise. “It’s not just a transactional program,” she says. “It’s about building those connections with the customer, and building that love for the brand.”The company has re-signed some important endorsement deals this year, including with Curry and Notre Dame. More broadly, Linnartz tells Fortune, she wants to expand what Under Armour is known for, especially by increasing its offerings in footwear, “sport style” athleisure, and female-focused clothing. (Women currently account for less than 25% of Under Armour’s business.) She also has articulated a strategy of building “brand heat”—or courting a more elite reputation in the United States—by expanding Under Armour’s own full-price stores and direct-to-consumer channels, while paring back on its sales through third-party partners.It’s a lot of expansion initiatives at once, especially for a brand still struggling with inconsistency, and investors aren’t yet won over: The company’s shares are down 25% since Linnartz took over in February. But the new strategies certainly bear her stamp. And hotel industry insiders argue that Linnartz’s ability to keep many plates spinning at once, while overseeing the global consumer operations of Marriott’s 30 brands and then-8,200 properties, might be exactly the experience Under Armour needs.“Marriott has an incredible breadth of operations, and it’s attempted to redefine itself as an organization that doesn’t just give you a room and a bath and a roof over your head, but tries to create a sense of style, and a sense of belonging,” says Sean Hennessey, a hotel industry consultant and associate professor at NYU’s Tisch Center of Hospitality. “Under Armour is very much in that vein of trying to appeal to people that don’t just need a T-shirt or shorts, but who dress in that clothing because it says something about the type of people that they are.”For her part, Linnartz isn’t giving up on her Marriott loyalty—even though her new boss is a hotelier himself, and has invested in a high-end boutique hotel near Under Armour’s offices. At a certain point during our interview, when I mention the less-than-amazing experience I had at a Marriott-operated property across the Inner Harbor from Under Armour’s headquarters, she nods knowingly: “That hotel needs help.” Then she laughs: “But don’t call me about that now.”Still, “I spent 25 years of my life there—and it was a very defining part of my life,” Linnartz reflects. “I will always be loyal to Marriott.” Now it’s time to move on, and hopefully—if she manages to pull off this “toughest, most difficult job”—to move ahead.This article appears in the October/November 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""Stephanie Linnartz bets on an underdog.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

DHS aims to establish regulatory frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI. It recognizes the benefits of AI in improving national security while acknowledging the associated risks.

98,ed9e78ac-68d4-3ead-a9e0-9bb99dceb59a,MAR,2023-10-09,25 Best Cheap Summer Vacation Destinations In The US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-best-cheap-summer-vacation-014555544.html,1696815955,STORY,"['TRIP', 'ABNB', 'MAR', 'BKNG', 'IHG']","[In this article, we take a look at the 25 best cheap summer vacation destinations in the US.  If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry, go to the 5 Best Cheap Summer Vacation Destinations In The US.According to a report from the early 2023, almost 85% of Americans expressed a desire to travel in the summer months, a 5% increase from 2022. And while people are slowly returning to international travel after the pandemic, surveys have shown that most Americans would still prefer vacationing within the country. The US itself offers every kind of vacation experience out there, so many never feel the need to take an overseas trip. Another reason for sticking to the home turf is the rising cost of travel as demand increases in a post-pandemic world. According to CNBC experts, international travel costs are ‘off the charts’, with airline tickets becoming more than 20% pricier compared to previous years. But travel costs within the US aren’t exactly cheap either. According to Forbes, just three nights in a mid-range hotel can cost you up to $500 per person, which reaches almost $2,000 for a family of four. However, that wouldn’t mean Americans are traveling less; intentions to travel are still increasing, as showcased by a statistic before. In the year 2022, the entire nation collectively spent $1.2 trillion on travel, which is a considerable number for the tourism industry. All this spending generated a $2.6 trillion economic footprint, almost double the amount. The key here is not to travel less but to travel smarter. The US has many hidden gems that are not the most popular locations for a family vacation, but they offer a much cheaper alternative compared to some of the most popular cities in the country. The choice of destination can make a grand difference in the total costs accumulated by a vacation, which is why picking a cheaper destination for your summer vacation really matters. This is precisely why this article focuses on the best cheap summer vacation destinations in the US that will deliver the whole experience without requiring you to break the bank. Story continuesThe US tourism and travel industry also supports millions of jobs around the country and generates more than 2% of the total GDP. The US has one of the largest tourism industries in the world, and hotel groups make up one of the biggest chunks in this sector. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) is one of the top-performing hotel chains in the country and has 25 branches located throughout the 50 states. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) generated gross revenue of more than $25 billion in 2022 and showcased a 4.9% net system size growth year over year. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) is a luxury hotel brand that offers a deluxe experience, complete with fantastic amenities and exclusive reward credit cards, that make the company a top priority for many tourists, both internationally and domestically. However, the past decade has moved the tourism industry beyond being limited to just airlines and hotels. Technological advancements have made the digital space a massive part of traveling. Corporations like Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) have revolutionized the way people travel, making it a lot easier to score discounts and locate the best travel deals. Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has its most prominent presence in the US, with many cities being highly profitable for the corporation. The company also runs its own analytics site under the name of Airbtics, which helps investors analyze the best places in the US to open up their own rentals. The company has managed to bridge the gap between tourists and rental owners, but it has also opened up questions about sustainable tourism. The state of New York just recently passed a piece of legislation that places a ‘de-facto ban’ on the functioning of rentals like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). The reason behind this was the opening of too many rental units that failed to meet the safety requirements. Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) was founded in 2000 and, in just 23 years, has grown to become one of the largest tourism-related sites in the whole world. By delivering user-generated reviews and price comparisons, Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) makes it easier to make travel-related decisions. The company had a revenue of $1.4 billion in 2022, showcasing a whopping 65% increase from the year 2021. These statistics offer a deep look into how the world is adjusting to travel after the COVID-19 lockdowns have been listed. The billions of dollars of revenue lost during the years of 2020 and 2021 are slowly being made up for. Then there’s Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), which is on a whole other level altogether. This is the largest travel company in the world, which includes a whole bunch of different sites that collectively offer more than 28 million global listings. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) generated more than $17 billion in revenue in 2022 alone and has a market cap of almost $106 billion right now. The corporation has embraced new technological ventures, such as offering conversational trip planning with ChatGPT. The AI experience will enhance people’s travel experience by making the planning process much more interactive than it currently is. The presence of companies like these in the market means travel is now easier than ever.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Tesla’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past six months (+40.5% vs. +26.2%). The electric vehicle (EV) giant witnessed record production, deliveries and revenues in the last reported quarter.Production ramp-up at Gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and the introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term delivery growth. Additionally, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenue outlook is promising. Falling debt levels and the solid potential of its charging business are other positives.However, shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and the introduction of new models.(You can read the full research report on Tesla here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+52.4% vs. +34.7%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and placed at a better competitive position against Microsoft’s Teams product.However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects in the near-term.(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here &gt;&gt;&gt;)McDonald's shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+10.6% vs. +9.6%). The company is benefiting from its strong comparable restaurant sales growth, digital initiatives, campaigns and loyalty programs.During the second quarter of 2023, digital dales (from the top six markets) came in at $8 billion, contributing 40% to the company’s system-wide sales. Given a rise in digital adoption, the company remains optimistic and anticipates the initiatives to drive sales and average checks in the upcoming periods. Also, its focus on marketing efforts and pricing strategies bodes well.Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism about the stock’s growth potential.

It is worth considering Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.When looking at the last two reports, this aerospace and defense company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.30%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Lockheed was expected to post earnings of $6.43 per share, but it reported $6.73 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.07 per share, while it actually produced $6.43 per share, a surprise of 5.93%.For Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Lockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 17, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I work there, you don’t understand.” As a software engineer, Trevor saw the value of Tesla’s ability to collect data from its fleet of vehicles that would eventually fuel the company’s self-driving ambitions. As the fleet expanded, Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple dropped from 1,401 in 2021 to 69 today.O’Leary claims he eventually took his son’s advice and added the stock to his personal portfolio, a decision that delivered over 1,000% in total return over time. The experience highlights the need to look beyond valuations when a company is rapidly expanding. Some of the best growth stocks justify their high P/E ratios over time.With that in mind, here are three growth stocks that could justify their multiples within a few years.NvidiaIt’s difficult to pick winners in the ongoing battle over generative artificial intelligence. Tech giants are investing billions of dollars into this new sector but the business model isn’t completely clear yet. What is clear, though, is there’s a growing demand for semiconductors.Nvidia (NVDA) has already posted stellar earnings based on this tailwind. Revenue was up 88% between the first and second quarter of this year. It was up 101% from the same quarter last year. As the battle intensifies, Nvidia is likely to emerge as a prime beneficiary.Story continuesThe stock currently trades at a P/E ratio of 98.38. Given its current growth rate, that ratio could drop to more modest levels rapidly. Keep an eye on this growth stock.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howRocket LabThe commercial space industry has matured enough to become an attractive spot for investment. Unfortunately the most popular company in this industry, SpaceX, is private. But publicly listed Rocket Lab (RKLB) is worth some attention. The company offers rocket-launch services, focusing on small satellites instead of heavy payloads.Between 2021 and 2022, the company more than tripled its revenue. In the second quarter of 2023, the team delivered $62 million in revenue, up 12% year-over-year. However, the company is still operating at a loss, which means a PE ratio doesn’t apply. Instead, the stock could be valued on a price-to-sales ratio of 8.53.Essentially, Rocket Lab is an attractive growth stock in a fascinating industry that deserves a closer look if you’re seeking out growth opportunities.NuBankFinTech startup NuBank (NU) was backed by none other than Warren Buffett when it went public in 2021. The stock has struggled since, but Buffett remains committed to the story.In the three-month period ending June 30, NuBank added 4.6 million new customers to its platform. That represents 28% growth year-over-year. Revenue, meanwhile, soared 60% during this period. The digital bank is also profitable, registering net income of $262.7 million in its latest quarter.These impressive numbers are being reflected in the stock price, which is up 95% year-to-date. But the P/E ratio is also high at 572.29. On paper, this stock looks egregiously expensive. But if Buffett thinks the price is justified, the stock probably deserves closer inspection from retail investors.What to read nextWorried about the economy?

As I described in my June video and article, NVDA should continue to trade at a premium of 20X sales as it progresses to $100 billion in annual revenue...Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion(end of excerpt from September 6 report)The Moonshot to $100 Billion in SalesIn that June video and article, I suggested that NVIDIA sales could climb to $100 billion annually by 2026. At the time, sales estimates for next year (FY’25 which ends in January of 2025) were just beginning to breach $50 billion after their May earnings and product announcements.Fast forward just over 3 months and here’s where the consensus views have ascended to...FY’24 (ends January): $54.4 billion for 101.7% growthFY’25 (begins in Feb): $80 billion for 47% growthAt a $1.1 trillion market cap, NVDA now trades under 14X next year's sales.And the profit optimism persists too as the premier maker of GPUs commands top margins. Here’s a look at the move higher in EPS estimates just in the past four weeks since my last public report (I update for members every week)...FY’24 EPS consensus just moved from $10.46 to $10.74FY'25 EPS consensus just moved from $15.48 to $16.32 (52% annual growth after the current year’s 221.5%+ advance!)$100 Billion -- Sooner Than Even I ImaginedKeep in mind that these are consensus views. The high end estimate on next year’s topline is $116 billion.Given the surge in demand for NVIDIA systems architecture like DGX Grace Hopper 200 supercomputers, even my optimistic expectations are getting run over quickly.To wit, last week KeyBanc analyst John Vinh put out a note where he explained why he was raising his price target from $670 to $750.After the firm's quarterly supply-chain channel checks, his top takeaway is that AI data center demand remained extremely strong, outstripping supply by about 20%.In his model, that computes to datacenter revenue of $45 billion for fiscal year 2024, up over 100%.Vinh reported that while China’s demand remained weak, it didn’t deteriorate significantly. More importantly, Vinh sees a new opportunity for Nvidia in the second half, driven by “very strong” demand for L40S, a GPU designed for datacenter workloads like generative AI and large language model inference and training.He estimates a revenue contribution of $2.25 billion to $3 billion from this next-gen GPU.I haven't talked much about the new L40S platform yet because we're still in a revenue phase driven by a mix shift from Ampere 100 chipsets to the higher ASP (average selling price) Grace Hopper 100 ""admirals.""A DGX system which holds eight GPUs, can command a price tag between $200,000 and $300,000 depending on configuration and availability (i.e., demand outstripping supply).But the L40S will be another game-changer for NVIDIA in datacenters because the workload capacities are hyper-industrial strength.Breaking down why Vinh sees NVIDIA DC doing $45 billion this year, he predicts that the Microsoft/Open AI alliance will procure 450,000 Nvidia GPUs this year, translating to $11 billion in revenue, and 1.6 million GPUs next year, contributing $40 billion in revenue. Story continuesThese estimates are based on ASPs for GPUs of about $25,000, which is really the low end in this demand-driven environment. The real market is closer to $40K each.And Apple (AAPL) is expected to purchase 200,000 H100 GPUs next year, representing $5 billion in revenue.“We believe NVDA has order and backlog visibility through 1H24 at this point and have not heard of any order cuts from its major CSP customers,” Vinh said.To wit, KeyBanc expects Nvidia's data center revenue of $101 billion for fiscal year 2025, up 124%.CUDA the KrakenIn my September report, I reviewed the “killer app” that makes NVIDIA GPUs so special...For the past seven years since I first learned about what Jensen was creating from GPU gaming cards, I’ve said that the key to NVIDIA innovation dominating the world of hyperscale accelerated computing revolved around three factors...1) The capabilities of GPU stacks creating ""massively parallel architectures"" for harnessing big-data with modeling, automation, and simulation2) The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) hardware + software stack that enables fast training and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models3) The evangelism of thousand of developers who get ingrained in the platform tools and never want to leave that ecosystemLong-time Apple evangelist Gene Munster recently said the same thing...“CUDA has created a moat around Nvidia's chip business. It would be difficult to get developers to switch to a different platform.”And that’s why observers like me and Dan Ives of Wedbush think that this is the ""iPhone moment"" for NVIDIA and its AI tools.In conclusion, let's hear from the AI wizard himself, Jensen Huang...""The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.""I think this translates into NVIDIA hitting $100 billion per year in revenue much sooner than my 2026 projection in June. So don’t miss your chance to buy NVDA under $450 again. I’m pretty sure you won’t see it below $400 ever again.(end of excerpt from Sep 6)As I write this on Friday afternoon, NVDA shares are popping back above $450 after a trip down to $410 on September 21. And I also see a new article by the Wall Street Journal’s Dan Gallagher in his Heard on the Street column titled “How Nvidia Got Huge — and Almost Invincible.”Here’s a quote that sums up the built-in invincibility of the developer moat…Over time, CUDA has grown to encompass 250 software libraries used by AI developers. That breadth effectively makes Nvidia the go-to platform for AI developers; Credit Suisse analysts said those libraries ""provide a starting point for AI projects that aren't available on non-NVDA systems, "" in a report earlier this year. During a speech at the Computex conference in May, Nvidia's Huang said CUDA was downloaded 25 million times over the last year, which was more than double the software's life-to-date downloads prior to that.Looks like I wasn't crazy optimistic enough calling for $100 billion in sales in 2025. Let’s make that call $125 billion now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Peltz's move, which included boosting Trian's stake in Disney.The window for board nominations begins on Dec. 5 and continues to Jan. 4. But the situation at Disney is so concerning that Peltz didn't see the need to wait until December, the person said.Trian now has a stake believed to be valued at about $2.5 billion, making it one of Disney's largest investors.No meeting between Peltz and Iger has been scheduled, according to the source.Iger may have been caught off-guard by the return of frequent critic Peltz for one simple reason: Peltz pulled back his contentious campaign against the company in February.At the time, Peltz said in a TV interview that ""Disney plans to do everything we wanted them to do."" Perhaps foreshadowing the latest move, Peltz added in the interview: ""We will be watching.""Since then, however, it has been a comedy of errors at Disney (or a horror movie).First, Disney's stock is down 26% since Peltz halted his campaign against Disney. The Dow Jones Industrial Average — of which Disney is a component — has fallen 2.4%.Meanwhile, following sweeping layoffs at Disney enacted by Iger this year, investors remain on pins and needles for the next restructuring move.Iger said in July he would take an ""expansive"" look at Disney's traditional TV assets, a signal to Wall Street that a sale of linear TV channels is in the cards amid growing cord-cutting by consumers.Story continuesWalt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniNo update from Disney has been provided since. Iger has said that he doesn't want to unload the ESPN brand.Other fears include Disney potentially overpaying to buy out its stake in Hulu from Comcast — discussions between the two parties have reportedly begun.The lack of information may well be unnerving investors.""To hear a leader in the industry like Bob Iger acknowledge that you have to put everything on the table right now, I think shows how seriously they're taking this,"" Goldman Sachs media analyst Brett Feldman said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).""It's a real signal to the Street that they're going to do what they need to do so that Disney can have another hundred years of success,"" Feldman added.Disney has not responded to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The conflict's geopolitical ramifications spark a jump in oil prices, adding to concerns over inflationary pressures as crucial U.S. consumer price data looms later in the week. Elsewhere, activist investor Nelson Peltz reportedly plans a push for board seats at Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), while Citigroup (NYSE:C) agrees to sell its mainland Chinese consumer wealth unit to HSBC Holdings (LON:HSBA).1. U.S. futures point lower amid Israel, Hamas conflictU.S. stock futures moved lower on Monday as investors gauged the impact of the intensifying conflict between Israel and Hamas and looked ahead to fresh inflation data later this week.At 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT), the Dow futures contract had lost 197 points or 0.6%, S&amp;P 500 futures shed 28 points or 0.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 107 points or 0.7%.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict escalated to full-blown war over the weekend, as members of the Islamist group Hamas attacked several Israeli towns, killing hundreds of Israelis and abducting dozens more. In response, Israeli air strikes pounded numerous targets in Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties.Markets were already in a fragile state as traders contended with twin worries over inflation and elevated interest rates. Data last week showed a stronger-than-expected surge in the number of jobs added by the American economy during the month, heaping on to these concerns.Officials at the Federal Reserve will have more crucial data to consider on Thursday, when the latest consumer price figures are set to be released. Heading into the numbers, the probability that the central bank will keep interest rates steady at its upcoming policy meeting next month stands at just over 76%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.The tensions have also soured sentiment ahead of a raft of bank earnings in the coming days that typically kick off the quarterly parade of corporate financial results.Story continues2. Middle East violence boosts U.S. dollar's safe haven status; shekel slidesThe U.S. dollar climbed, with traders shying away from riskier assets for the relative safety of the greenback following clashes between forces from Israel and Palestinian group Hamas.By 04:51 ET, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of its peers, had risen by 0.4% to 106.49. It was further bolstered by bets that, despite muted wage growth, the tight labor market picture could be foreshadowing a hotter-than-anticipated inflation print later this week.In the wake of the outbreak of the violence, the Israeli shekel slumped to its weakest level against the dollar since 2016. This prompted the central Bank of Israel to announce that it would sell up to $30 billion in foreign currency to help stabilize the shekel.The bank pledged in a statement to ""operate in the market during the coming period"" to moderate volatility in the shekel exchange rate and provide liquidity for the ""continued proper functioning of the markets.""3. Oil prices soarOil prices soared, rebounding from a drop last week, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas deepened political uncertainty in the Middle East and exacerbated supply fears.At 04:52 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 3.0% higher at $85.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 2.8% to $86.95 per barrel.Last week saw oil prices post their steepest weekly losses since March, with Brent falling by about 11% and WTI recording an over 8% dip, on worries that persistently high interest rates will slow global growth and hammer fuel demand.Although neither Israel nor Palestine are major players in the global energy market, the violence could have subsequent effects on the geopolitical strategies of key crude producers in the Middle East. Supply is already under some strain from a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend output reductions until the end of 2023.The jump in oil has fueled concerns over a prolonged crude rally that may give renewed vigor to inflationary pressures, which could force central banks around the world to leave borrowing costs higher for a longer period of time.4. Nelson Peltz planning push for Disney board seats - WSJNelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management is expected to request multiple seats on the board of Walt Disney, according to the Wall Street Journal.Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said that Trian, who owns around a $2.5 billion stake in the group, will ask that one of those seats be reserved for Peltz.Trian may nominate possible directors that would be voted on at an annual meeting next year should Disney refuse, the WSJ noted.Shares in the entertainment giant have slumped by over 6% so far this year despite a short-lived rise in the stock in February after the unveiling of a sweeping restructuring plan.5. Citi to sell China wealth management portfolio to HSBCCitigroup has agreed to sell its retail wealth management portfolio in mainland China to HSBC, the lenders said in statements on Monday.The transaction, which will cover total deposits and investment assets under management of around $3.6 billion across 11 large Chinese cities, is expected to close in the first half of 2024.Citi had previously announced plans to divest its retail operations in several Asian countries. The U.S.-based bank is aiming to offload its Indonesia consumer business later this year, it added.For Asia-focused HSBC, the move will expand its presence in China at a time when the company is looking to the world's second-biggest economy to help drive revenues.Related ArticlesFutures slip amid Middle East violence, oil surges - what's moving marketsIMF, World Bank annual summit addresses global economic resilience in disaster-stricken MoroccoECB Vice-President signals potential inflation downturn amid geopolitical tensions]"

121,800a8414-bc61-3c12-a21b-cd45b219a76d,UA,2023-10-09,Stephanie Linnartz ended a successful run at Marriott to become CEO at struggling Under Armour. ‘I believe in taking calculated risks’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stephanie-linnartz-ended-successful-run-100000086.html,1696845600,STORY,"['MAR', 'UAA']","[Imagine that you grow up, literally, in the hotel industry. Your parents run an iconic pub and boutique hotel in Washington, D.C., where you spend your teenage summers cleaning rooms and working the checkout desk. After college, you intern at Hilton, go to business school, and then join the finance department of Marriott International, the largest hotel company in the world.Over the next 25 years, you rise through the ranks to become one of Marriott’s most senior executives, and its highest-ranking woman, telling Fortune in 2015 that “anyone can make it to the top here if you work really hard.” And by 2021, when you’re named one of two executives sharing the duties of acting CEO and likely in line to become the next chief executive, it seems like your lifelong devotion to this industry is about to pay off.And then you don’t get the job. What do you do next?For Stephanie Linnartz—the former president of Marriott, and now the CEO of struggling sportswear company Under Armour—the answer was: Find one of the biggest turnaround jobs out there, and get back to work.“Why things happen, we don’t ever know for sure,” she tells me during an interview at the new corner office that she’s still settling into, overlooking Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. “But life’s all about timing—and I always had this idea that the rewards of taking risks are, the great majority of the time, worth it.”On the surface, Linnartz’s decision to jump to a bro-y sportswear retailer seems like an odd fit for an executive who’s spent her career in luxury hotels. It even required a personal-style pivot: At Marriott, “I wore dresses and high heels every day,” she reminisces, but during our interview she sports her new executive uniform of Under Armour sneakers and a white zip-up jacket. And the challenges go far beyond fashion. Linnartz is several months into what she has called a three-year turnaround plan, for a once-buzzy brand that has seen its growth stagnate and share price plummet in the past decade. (Under Armour is also a much smaller company, with only $5.9 billion in revenue and 15,000 employees, to Marriott’s $20.8 billion and 140,000.) And she’s coming in as an outsider to a founder-dominated company still controlled by executive chairman Kevin Plank, four years and three chief executives after he “stepped down” from his CEO role.Story continues“She obviously has an important voice and an important role, and I’m sure that she will exert influence,” says Neil Saunders, a GlobalData Retail analyst who covers Under Armour. But “it’s very difficult, when you have someone who founded the business and still has very strong views about the business, calling some of the shots.”Still, Linnartz wanted to be a chief executive—and when the obvious path to that role closed at Marriott, she followed the advice she’s given to many other women over the years. “Take the toughest, most difficult job or project someone can give you, because that’s how you move ahead,” is how Linnartz characterized her career philosophy to Fortune eight years ago.Her new job certainly seems to fit the bill. “There are challenges,” she acknowledges. “And we’ll face them.” Under Armour, as even its employees admit, has been in trouble for a long time.Plank started the company in his grandmother’s basement in 1996, as I was told multiple times by multiple people over the course of three hours at Under Armour headquarters in August. He was inspired by his time playing college football for the University of Maryland, where he regularly sweated through cotton shirts ill-equipped to handle an athlete’s perspiration. His startup first defined itself as a founder-led seller of performance gear, one that today has a team of employees devoted to developing “revolutionary yarn” and that boasts about using “over 10,000 fabrics in our history”—most of them optimized to reduce the amount of sweat you have to deal with while performing very sweat-heavy physical feats.And for a while, Under Armour was cool. It won endorsements and signed deals with a wide range of high schools, colleges, and professional athletes, including heavy hitters: NBA superstar Steph Curry, college football powerhouse Notre Dame, even professional ballerina Misty Copeland. In 2005, less than 10 years in, Under Armour went public, successfully—its shares doubled within the first day of trading, making it the first U.S. company in five years to have such a pop. The share price peaked at a split-adjusted high of $52 in 2015, as the company’s annual revenues were soaring by 28%.But in 2023, Under Armour is struggling to grow sales or profits, and its shares are trading around $6.50. The company hasn’t accumulated the sneakerhead cred or ongoing athlete endorsements of Nike and Adidas, and its historical focus on performance, rather than fashion, has made Under Armour a lagging player in the pandemic-era athleisure boom that turned Lululemon into a juggernaut. Deadspin recently called it the “worst sports apparel company of the past 20 years,” and analysts concur that it’s “a second-tier brand,” as Saunders says. “What’s gone wrong with Under Armour is what’s always been wrong: Under Armour doesn’t really know what it is.”–87%Change in Under Armour's share price since its 2015 peak. As of 9/21/23Without many of its own stores, and without the high-polish e-commerce reputation of younger competitors, Under Armour sits in an awkward retail spot. It still relies too much on third-party retailers to sell its stuff, something that Linnartz and other executives acknowledge has led to an “inconsistent” reputation in the U.S.: Today, Under Armour might be best described as something that teenage boys’ moms buy for them, on sale, at Kohl’s. But for the woman who jumped into this turnaround job, “there’s tremendous upside,” Linnartz claims. “There’s incredible love for the brand, globally—and so I’m super excited about it.”The oldest of six children in an Irish American family, Linnartz grew up in northern Virginia—not far from the Maryland headquarters of Marriott and now Under Armour. One brother still runs the Dubliner pub, a Capitol Hill hangout that has hosted U.S. presidents and Irish ambassadors as well as plenty of locals and tourists. In person, Linnartz doesn’t come across as a chatty publican’s daughter—she’s warm but brisk, and deftly swats most questions back toward her corporate talking points. But she’s inherited a relish for focusing on customers’ experiences. She also has an affinity for complex challenges. As she climbed the ranks at Marriott, she became known for taking on projects “that were lying in plain sight, that were hard, and that needed to be tackled,” says Jim Dausch, Marriott’s former chief product and digital officer, who in June left the hotel chain after 20 years to reunite with Linnartz as Under Armour’s chief consumer officer.For example, after Marriott purchased Starwood in 2016 for $13 billion, Linnartz oversaw the massive integration between two operating systems, including the customer-loyalty programs that are so crucial for repeat business in the hospitality industry. She ultimately built its Marriott Bonvoy rewards platform, now the world’s largest such hospitality program, with 186 million members. And according to Dausch, she also kick-started a complicated and expensive overhaul of the back-end tech behind Marriott’s disparate systems. That project was becoming more high-stakes as the company expanded into all-inclusive resorts and residences and other operations, but it was one where “the company had always kind of kicked the can down the road,” Dausch says. “After the Starwood integration was over, Stephanie was the one to say, ‘We have to take this on’ … She really led that charge.”Linnartz, with Steph Curry and Under Armour employees, hopes to expand the company’s presence in “athleisure” and female-focused clothing.The last few years of Linnartz’s tenure at Marriott were overshadowed by global and personal tragedies. The pandemic upended the hotel industry; Marriott laid off tens of thousands of workers and shed $10 billion in revenue in 2020, as travel ground to a halt. At the same time, its widely respected CEO, Arne Sorenson, was fighting pancreatic cancer. In February 2021, he stepped back from running the company, which said that Linnartz and fellow top executive Tony Capuano would take over his day-to-day responsibilities. Two weeks later, Sorenson died—and before the end of the month, Marriott’s board announced that Capuano would be the next CEO. Linnartz was named president, in charge of running global consumer strategy, as well as development, technology, and emerging business.Hospitality insiders praise Capuano, a veteran development executive under whom Marriott’s stock has risen more than 31%. But some mourn the symbolic missed opportunity of Linnartz not getting the CEO role, in a relatively small travel industry where only 30% of senior executives are female and very few run large hotel or airline companies. “I think most women in the industry were disappointed that it wasn’t a woman,” says Flo Lugli, a hotel industry consultant and former senior executive at Wyndham and Radisson. “But Marriott has a great reputation of developing good leaders.”For almost two more years, Linnartz was a good soldier. But “I’ve always been a big believer in taking risk, and saying, ‘How can I grow myself as a leader and a human being?’ ” she says. When one CEO left Under Armour in June 2022 and the board started looking for a permanent replacement, “I was ready to take that next leap.”A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. And there’s another way in which her résumé has prepared her for some of the company’s challenges: At Marriott, which is still 16% owned by the eponymous Marriott family and where the founders’ descendants still very much have a voice, Sorenson in 2012 became the first non-family CEO in the company’s then-85-year history.So Linnartz knows how to work for a company where keeping the founder happy is part of the job. The challenge, with Under Armour, will be doing so while cleaning up some of the problems created on his watch. Plank—or “KP,” as longtime employees call him—occupied the CEO’s office for 24 years. His origin story is still fetishized, to a near-cultish degree, at headquarters: Buildings and apparel lines are numbered either 96 (for the year he founded Under Armour) or 37 (for the number of KP’s college football jersey). One corridor at headquarters is decorated with an enormous photo of that jersey, next to blown-up versions of Plank’s early Under Armour business cards, next to #inspo phrases like “HUMBLE &amp; HUNGRY BEGINNINGS.”For a long time, Plank was Under Armour’s best brand ambassador—until he started landing the company in the middle of ugly controversies. In 2017, he publicly praised President Trump—to the vocal displeasure of Under Armour’s celebrity spokespeople, including Curry and Copeland—before reversing course and resigning from the president’s business council over Trump’s response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Then, in 2018, the Wall Street Journal broke a series of stories on inappropriate workplace behavior and a sexualized culture at Under Armour; Plank and his executives even attended company-paid trips to strip clubs, the Journal reported. And in 2021, the company agreed to pay $9 million to settle an SEC investigation into financial disclosure failures dating back six years. At the beginning of 2020, Plank nominally stepped down from leading Under Armour, keeping his “executive chairman” role and naming company president Patrik Frisk CEO.Founder Kevin Plank remains Under Armour’s controlling shareholder.But as several chief executives elsewhere in the corporate world have discovered to their dismay in recent months, “executive chair” often means “CEO by any other name.” Frisk, interim CEO Colin Browne, and now Linnartz have all reported to Plank, who owns 65% of Under Armour’s voting shares. And outside the boardroom, KP’s public profile continues to create headaches; two days before I interviewed Linnartz for this article, unsealed court documents in a six-year-old shareholder lawsuit revealed that Plank had shared nonpublic financial information with television journalist Stephanie Ruhle. The revelations of the inappropriate-at-best relationship made widespread, gossipy headlines.“I don’t tolerate gossip—and for many people here, this is old news,” says Linnartz, adding that her approach involved “leaving some of the noise aside, that has nothing to do with the business, to focus on what is terrific about Kevin, and inspiring as only a founder can be.”Plank, for his part, declined multiple interview requests for this article. A spokesperson said that he was traveling, and sent along an emailed statement calling Linnartz “the obvious choice” for CEO. “She has hit the ground running, launching a clearly articulated three-year strategy that sets us up for strategic growth,” Plank wrote. “I could not be more excited to have her at Under Armour and to work with her every day.”However Linnartz navigates her relationship with her executive chairman over the coming months, she has plenty of cautionary tales. Recent years have given us several examples of ambitious, experienced executives—often women—who take on a CEO job that involves working for a predecessor or founder, and trying to keep him happy while fixing some of the problems he created. There’s Linda Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal executive who’s now enthusiastically embracing whatever Elon Musk has turned Twitter into. There’s Roz Brewer, the former Starbucks chief operating officer who became Walgreens CEO in 2021—and who abruptly left in late August, after two and a half years of working for Stefano Pessina, the executive chairman and largest shareholder at Walgreens. And there’s Sonia Syngal, whose 2022 exit from Gap Inc. came after two years of trying to turn around a retailer that’s more than 40% owned by its founding family. (The departures of Syngal and Brewer, who had been one of only two Black female CEOs running a Fortune 500 company, also represented losses specifically for women of color.)A runner and a fierce football fan, Linnartz says going to Under Armour wasn’t as big a career leap as it first appears. “There’s incredible love for the brand,” she says.Everyone has a boss to keep happy—even ridiculously well-compensated CEOs—and the vagaries of working for the guy you’re supposedly replacing aren’t always gendered. But it’s striking how many ambitious women, still, have to take such risks in order to get a shot at the top spot in corporate America, where women account for barely 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs. The career choices made by Brewer, Yaccarino, and potentially Linnartz also raise questions about how much executives still have to navigate the “glass cliff,” the data-backed phenomenon in which women have to accept riskier opportunities in order to advance.So is this the tightrope Linnartz is walking at Under Armour? Probably—but “I don’t focus on that,” Linnartz says. “I believe in taking calculated risks. I don’t believe in being reckless.” And according to her friends and colleagues, she has the work ethic—and the courage—to pull Under Armour and her career back from this potential brink.“She’s very data-driven, she’s got great judgment, and she doesn’t underestimate” how much work something will be, says Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, No. 2 on this year’s Fortune Most Powerful Women list, who got to know Linnartz through her company’s consulting work for Marriott. (Under Armour has also been an Accenture client.)“She knows what the challenges are,” Sweet adds, “and she’s going to absolutely overcome them.”Six months in, Linnartz has already taken some pages from the hospitality-industry playbook—especially her experience pulling in Starwood’s beloved loyalty program, and creating Marriott Bonvoy. In July, Under Armour launched a UA Rewards program that Linnartz argues is about getting customers more excited about Under Armour—by promising them access to sports tickets or special events with celebrity athletes or early entry to sneaker launches—as much as it is about pushing merchandise. “It’s not just a transactional program,” she says. “It’s about building those connections with the customer, and building that love for the brand.”The company has re-signed some important endorsement deals this year, including with Curry and Notre Dame. More broadly, Linnartz tells Fortune, she wants to expand what Under Armour is known for, especially by increasing its offerings in footwear, “sport style” athleisure, and female-focused clothing. (Women currently account for less than 25% of Under Armour’s business.) She also has articulated a strategy of building “brand heat”—or courting a more elite reputation in the United States—by expanding Under Armour’s own full-price stores and direct-to-consumer channels, while paring back on its sales through third-party partners.It’s a lot of expansion initiatives at once, especially for a brand still struggling with inconsistency, and investors aren’t yet won over: The company’s shares are down 25% since Linnartz took over in February. But the new strategies certainly bear her stamp. And hotel industry insiders argue that Linnartz’s ability to keep many plates spinning at once, while overseeing the global consumer operations of Marriott’s 30 brands and then-8,200 properties, might be exactly the experience Under Armour needs.“Marriott has an incredible breadth of operations, and it’s attempted to redefine itself as an organization that doesn’t just give you a room and a bath and a roof over your head, but tries to create a sense of style, and a sense of belonging,” says Sean Hennessey, a hotel industry consultant and associate professor at NYU’s Tisch Center of Hospitality. “Under Armour is very much in that vein of trying to appeal to people that don’t just need a T-shirt or shorts, but who dress in that clothing because it says something about the type of people that they are.”For her part, Linnartz isn’t giving up on her Marriott loyalty—even though her new boss is a hotelier himself, and has invested in a high-end boutique hotel near Under Armour’s offices. At a certain point during our interview, when I mention the less-than-amazing experience I had at a Marriott-operated property across the Inner Harbor from Under Armour’s headquarters, she nods knowingly: “That hotel needs help.” Then she laughs: “But don’t call me about that now.”Still, “I spent 25 years of my life there—and it was a very defining part of my life,” Linnartz reflects. “I will always be loyal to Marriott.” Now it’s time to move on, and hopefully—if she manages to pull off this “toughest, most difficult job”—to move ahead.This article appears in the October/November 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""Stephanie Linnartz bets on an underdog.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

The US crude benchmark rose to as high as $87.23 earlier.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract settled up $3.57, or 4.2%, at $88.15. The session high was $89 — just a dollar short of bringing the global crude benchmark back to the key bullish mark of $90 per barrel.""The bullish gap up momentum in WTI continues with stability above the critical 50-day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $85,"" noted Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com. ""If this support holds, expect a retest of the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $89.00. But if WTI breaks below $85, it will trigger a pull back towards the gap at $83 and extend decline further to $81.""As Hamas rockets continued to rain on Israel’s largest city, Tel Aviv, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “change the Middle East” with Israel's war against the Palestine militant group, oil traders tried to ascertain the immediate impact of the crisis on oil supply from Iran.Tehran is not only the world’s fifth largest crude exporter but also a vociferous supporter of the Palestine cause — and often initiator of Middle East conflagration.Iran is tacitly known to be behind Hamas at all times. To reinforce that notion, an adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Tehran supported the operation against Israel that had reportedly killed some 1,300 people at the time of writing, and led to the abduction of dozens of Israelis by ground forces of the militant group.“We congratulate the Palestinian fighters for this operation,” Yahya Rahim Safavi said, adding that Iran would stand by the Hamas fighters until they had “liberated” Palestinian territories and Jerusalem from Israeli control.Story continuesNasser Kanaani, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, also said the Hamas operation had “turned a new page” in the fight against Israel.Without loss of Iranian barrels, oil might not rise too much from this crisisJohn Kilduff, a partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, who has spent two decades analyzing the impact of Middle East geopolitical strife on oil, likened the crisis to the “reset” sought by bulls hoping for a game changer in crude, after a woeful start to October trading.“While there’s a huge immediate shock value, as well as durability and elasticity, in this crisis, what will matter in the end is the actual impact on oil supply, not implied,” Kilduff said. “Are the Iranians without doubt the sponsors of this attack, and if so, will the war vowed by Israel end up severely debilitating Iran’s oil shipments?”“Also, will the US, after a long period of scant sanctions enforcement against Tehran’s oil, double down as well? If these things don’t happen the oil price could come back down.”Vivek Dhar, analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), had a similar view, saying:""For this conflict to have a lasting and meaningful impact on oil markets, there must be a sustained reduction in oil supply or transport. If Western countries officially link Iranian intelligence to the Hamas attack, then Iran’s oil supply and exports face imminent downside risks.”With the Israelis vowing commensurate response for one of the worst attacks ever on their soil, a counter engagement against Tehran, either unilaterally by Jerusalem, or with the combined might of the United States, could have ramifications for the oil trade.“Even if Israel doesn’t immediately respond to Iran, the repercussions will likely affect Iranian oil production,” Bloomberg oil columnist Javier Blas wrote. “Since late 2022, Washington has turned a blind eye to surging Iranian oil exports, bypassing American sanctions. The priority in Washington was an informal détente with Tehran.”“As a result, Iranian oil output has surged nearly 700,000 barrels a day this year – the second-largest source of incremental supply in 2023, behind only US shale. The White House is now likely to enforce the sanctions.”As of Monday, production cuts by the global group of oil producers known as OPEC+ looked set to continue as well, with no change indicated by Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman.The Saudis and Russians, who jointly lead the OPEC+, are withholding a daily supply of 1.3 million barrels between them, while the rest of the 23-nation alliance is contributing to a squeeze of another 2 million barrels or more.“I honestly believe that the best thing I could say is that the cohesion of OPEC+ should not be challenged. We’ve been through the worst, I don’t think we will have to go through any terrible situation at all,” Abdulaziz, the Saudi energy minister, said on the sidelines of a climate conference in Riyadh.“Yes, we may be delayed with a decision on what to do, but I would not forfeit the precautionary approach, even if it goes beyond a month or two, or three or four months, or five months,” he added.Early last week, oil hit more than one-year highs of $95 for WTI and $97 for Brent, responding to the aggressive OPEC+ cuts.From there, the market tumbled on a backdrop of macro and economic factors as US Treasury yields hit 16-year highs and the dollar soared to a 10-month peak while consumption of gasoline — the No. 1 fuel product in the United States — hit a seasonal low of 25 years. Specifically, US crude fell 9% last week and Brent 11%, the biggest weekly slump since March. It was a selloff deeper than any weekly rally in oil over the past three months.“(That) this conflict could widen and drag in the West means the risk of future sanctions against Iran are growing,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “This is not going to be a quick war between Israel and Hamas, which means we could see oil behave more like a safe-haven if the geopolitical landscape deteriorates.”“The oil market will remain volatile as potential supply disruptions will also need to counter falling global travel demand.”(Peter Nurse contributed to this article)Related ArticlesOil up over 4%, reset by Mideast crisis; all eyes on Iranian supply Exclusive-US, Venezuela in talks for fresh oil sanction exemptions -sourcesExxon-Pioneer tie up could squeeze US shale oil suppliers, pipelines]"

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) shareholders, since the share price is down 13% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 21%.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Colgate-Palmolive saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 15% per year, over the last three years. In comparison the 5% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So, despite the prior disappointment, shareholders must have some confidence the situation will improve, longer term.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Colgate-Palmolive's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Colgate-Palmolive's TSR for the last 3 years was -6.6%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveColgate-Palmolive shareholders gained a total return of 3.2% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 5% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.We will like Colgate-Palmolive better if we see some big insider buys.

The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Peltz's move, which included boosting Trian's stake in Disney.The window for board nominations begins on Dec. 5 and continues to Jan. 4. But the situation at Disney is so concerning that Peltz didn't see the need to wait until December, the person said.Trian now has a stake believed to be valued at about $2.5 billion, making it one of Disney's largest investors.No meeting between Peltz and Iger has been scheduled, according to the source.Iger may have been caught off-guard by the return of frequent critic Peltz for one simple reason: Peltz pulled back his contentious campaign against the company in February.At the time, Peltz said in a TV interview that ""Disney plans to do everything we wanted them to do."" Perhaps foreshadowing the latest move, Peltz added in the interview: ""We will be watching.""Since then, however, it has been a comedy of errors at Disney (or a horror movie).First, Disney's stock is down 26% since Peltz halted his campaign against Disney. The Dow Jones Industrial Average — of which Disney is a component — has fallen 2.4%.Meanwhile, following sweeping layoffs at Disney enacted by Iger this year, investors remain on pins and needles for the next restructuring move.Iger said in July he would take an ""expansive"" look at Disney's traditional TV assets, a signal to Wall Street that a sale of linear TV channels is in the cards amid growing cord-cutting by consumers.Story continuesWalt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni (Mario Anzuoni / reuters)No update from Disney has been provided since. Iger has said that he doesn't want to unload the ESPN brand.Other fears include Disney potentially overpaying to buy out its stake in Hulu from Comcast — discussions between the two parties have reportedly begun.The lack of information may well be unnerving investors.""To hear a leader in the industry like Bob Iger acknowledge that you have to put everything on the table right now, I think shows how seriously they're taking this,"" Goldman Sachs media analyst Brett Feldman said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).""It's a real signal to the Street that they're going to do what they need to do so that Disney can have another hundred years of success,"" Feldman added.Disney has not responded to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(NYSE:PRU) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 57% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-130031979.html,1696770031,STORY,['PRU'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Prudential Financial's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the companyUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 57% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudential Financial. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Prudential Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Prudential Financial's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Prudential Financial. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$59m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Prudential Financial. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

And while people are slowly returning to international travel after the pandemic, surveys have shown that most Americans would still prefer vacationing within the country. The US itself offers every kind of vacation experience out there, so many never feel the need to take an overseas trip. Another reason for sticking to the home turf is the rising cost of travel as demand increases in a post-pandemic world. According to CNBC experts, international travel costs are ‘off the charts’, with airline tickets becoming more than 20% pricier compared to previous years. But travel costs within the US aren’t exactly cheap either. According to Forbes, just three nights in a mid-range hotel can cost you up to $500 per person, which reaches almost $2,000 for a family of four. However, that wouldn’t mean Americans are traveling less; intentions to travel are still increasing, as showcased by a statistic before. In the year 2022, the entire nation collectively spent $1.2 trillion on travel, which is a considerable number for the tourism industry. All this spending generated a $2.6 trillion economic footprint, almost double the amount. The key here is not to travel less but to travel smarter. The US has many hidden gems that are not the most popular locations for a family vacation, but they offer a much cheaper alternative compared to some of the most popular cities in the country. The choice of destination can make a grand difference in the total costs accumulated by a vacation, which is why picking a cheaper destination for your summer vacation really matters. This is precisely why this article focuses on the best cheap summer vacation destinations in the US that will deliver the whole experience without requiring you to break the bank. Story continuesThe US tourism and travel industry also supports millions of jobs around the country and generates more than 2% of the total GDP. The US has one of the largest tourism industries in the world, and hotel groups make up one of the biggest chunks in this sector. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) is one of the top-performing hotel chains in the country and has 25 branches located throughout the 50 states. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) generated gross revenue of more than $25 billion in 2022 and showcased a 4.9% net system size growth year over year. Intercontinental Hotels Grp Plc (NYSE:IHG) is a luxury hotel brand that offers a deluxe experience, complete with fantastic amenities and exclusive reward credit cards, that make the company a top priority for many tourists, both internationally and domestically. However, the past decade has moved the tourism industry beyond being limited to just airlines and hotels. Technological advancements have made the digital space a massive part of traveling. Corporations like Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) have revolutionized the way people travel, making it a lot easier to score discounts and locate the best travel deals. Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has its most prominent presence in the US, with many cities being highly profitable for the corporation. The company also runs its own analytics site under the name of Airbtics, which helps investors analyze the best places in the US to open up their own rentals. The company has managed to bridge the gap between tourists and rental owners, but it has also opened up questions about sustainable tourism. The state of New York just recently passed a piece of legislation that places a ‘de-facto ban’ on the functioning of rentals like Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). The reason behind this was the opening of too many rental units that failed to meet the safety requirements. Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) was founded in 2000 and, in just 23 years, has grown to become one of the largest tourism-related sites in the whole world. By delivering user-generated reviews and price comparisons, Tripadvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) makes it easier to make travel-related decisions. The company had a revenue of $1.4 billion in 2022, showcasing a whopping 65% increase from the year 2021. These statistics offer a deep look into how the world is adjusting to travel after the COVID-19 lockdowns have been listed. The billions of dollars of revenue lost during the years of 2020 and 2021 are slowly being made up for. Then there’s Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), which is on a whole other level altogether. This is the largest travel company in the world, which includes a whole bunch of different sites that collectively offer more than 28 million global listings. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) generated more than $17 billion in revenue in 2022 alone and has a market cap of almost $106 billion right now. The corporation has embraced new technological ventures, such as offering conversational trip planning with ChatGPT. The AI experience will enhance people’s travel experience by making the planning process much more interactive than it currently is. The presence of companies like these in the market means travel is now easier than ever.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.Barclays Plc suggests that global bonds are likely to continue falling unless there's a significant decline in equities that renews interest in fixed-income assets, reported Bloomberg. According to analysts led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha, there isn't a specific yield level that guarantees a sustained bond rally. They highlight that in the short term, a substantial bond rally could occur only if risk assets experience a sharp decline. The note also mentions that the Federal Reserve will persist as a net seller of Treasuries, potentially leading to a rise in the term premium. Additionally, Japanese investors may show a preference for domestic bonds as yields increase. The dollar remained stable on October 5, while West Texas Intermediate crude maintained its position around $84 per barrel, following a retreat observed in the previous session. The plummet in oil prices persists as Brent falls below the $85 mark amid apprehensions about a global growth slowdown impacting consumption. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) witnessed a further decline, dropping below $84 after experiencing a 5.7% slump in Wednesday's trade. Notably, US data revealed the weakest seasonal gasoline usage in 25 years, contributing to the downward pressure on oil prices. This decline in crude prices closely followed a substantial drop in gasoline prices prompted by a surge in US stockpiles and a decrease in demand.According to CNBC, in the clash between the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC over peak oil demand, the IEA's prediction of reaching peak demand by 2030 sparked criticism from OPEC, labeling it as fear-mongering. The dispute reflects the broader tension between climate concerns and energy security, evident at the recent ADIPEC gathering. Oil CEOs argue for a dual approach, claiming their industry is part of the solution. Eni's CEO, Claudio Descalzi, warns against reducing oil investment, predicting economic repercussions from a supply shortfall. The IEA forecasts peak oil demand before 2030 due to factors like electric vehicles and renewable power. OPEC cites ongoing demand increases but faces climate scientists' urgency to cut fossil fuel emissions. OPEC's al-Ghais calls for a balanced approach, investing in both oil and renewables to meet Paris Agreement goals. The debate intensifies at COP28, where leaders address climate action.Story continuesOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price TargetsImage by MayoFi from Pixabay10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Upside Potential: 8%On October 4, Bank of America delivered an optimistic outlook on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), raising its price target from $142.00 to $146.00 while maintaining a ""Buy"" recommendation. This upward adjustment, coupled with the current stock price of $135.24, indicates a 2.1% increase after the announcement. The 2.1% change in the current price following the upgrade underscores an immediate positive market response to Bank of America's revised target. It signifies that investors react favorably to the heightened expectations for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) future performance. While this near-term movement is noteworthy, the more substantial implication lies in the near 8% upside potential from the current price to the new target of $146.00. The revised target suggests that Bank of America envisions a considerable growth trajectory for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), emphasizing confidence in the company's fundamentals and future prospects. Investors may interpret this upward adjustment as a strong signal of the potential for sustained capital appreciation in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock.Artisan Global Value Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our best performing stocks this quarter were Meta, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Heidelberg Materials. The rise in Alphabet’s share performance was primarily driven by the AI frenzy. Earlier this year, there were some doubts about Alphabet’s ability to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. This was a bit ironic since Alphabet has been using AI technology to improve its Google search results and advertising business for years. Indeed, the technology that underpins OpenAI’s ChatGPT actually came from Alphabet more than five years ago. But sometimes the market needs a reminder, and Alphabet provided tangible evidence of its capabilities. At a recent developer conference, it launched Bard, a consumer-oriented generative AI version of its search engine, as well as several other concrete examples of how AI could improve its current business. As with Meta, the long-term implications of AI on Alphabet’s business model are still far from certain. But we do believe that it is a technology leader in this field and will participate in whatever direction the technology develops.”09. Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA)Upside Potential: 11%On October 4, Susquehanna exhibited heightened optimism for Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) within the logistics and transportation industry by revising its price target from $320.00 to $450.00 while maintaining a ""Neutral"" rating. This upward adjustment signifies a substantial 11% potential upside from the prevailing stock price of $404.73. The adjustment in the price target indicates Susquehanna's positive outlook on Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) growth prospects and its ability to navigate the complexities of the logistics sector effectively. The neutral rating suggests a balanced assessment of Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) current performance, acknowledging stability even as the price target is raised. Investors keen on assessing the investment landscape within the logistics industry may find this revised target particularly noteworthy. The 11% difference between the new target and the current price highlights the perceived upside potential, serving as a crucial metric for those considering positions in Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA). While the immediate 0.5% increase in the current stock price following the target revision is noteworthy, the broader implication lies in the substantial upside potential. This combination of short-term movement and long-term potential provides investors with a multifaceted view, encouraging them to consider both immediate market responses and the overarching growth prospects for Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) in their strategic decision-making.TimesSquare U.S. Small Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA), a transportation services company, surged ahead by 26% and posted a solid quarter with higher-than-expected earnings. Better pricing offset a volume decline. Saia has opened four new terminals year-to-date.”08. Linde plc (NYSE:LIN)Upside Potential: 19%On October 4, Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) received a favorable endorsement from Citigroup as the financial institution raised its price target for the company from $448.00 to $450.00, maintaining a ""Buy"" recommendation. This adjustment comes in the context of the industrial gases industry, reinforcing positive sentiments for Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) future performance. The current stock price stands at $378.61, marking a 1.6% increase following the target revision. The elevated price target signals Citigroup's confidence in Linde's growth trajectory, suggesting the potential for further appreciation in the company's market value. The ""Buy"" recommendation aligns with a bullish outlook, emphasizing the attractiveness of Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) stock as an investment opportunity. Investors, particularly those interested in the industrial gases sector, may find this updated target price a compelling factor in their decision-making process. The 1.6% increase in the current stock price reflects an immediate positive market response to Citigroup's revised outlook, indicating the resonance of the upgraded target among investors. As market participants evaluate their portfolios, the combination of the 1.6% immediate price change and the 18.7% upside potential from the current price to the new target of $450.00 provides a holistic perspective.Madison Funds made the following comment about Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) stock was strong during the fourth quarter following a solid third quarter. Linde remains well positioned with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and energy transition with carbon dioxide sequestration opportunities, gasification services, and various hydrogen projects. Linde and Schlumberger announced that they entered into a collaboration of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects to accelerate decarbonization solutions across industrial and energy sectors. The collaboration will combine decades of experience in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. The collaboration will focus on hydrogen and ammonia production where carbon dioxide is a by-product. The International Energy Agency estimates that 6 Gigatons of carbon dioxide will need to be abated with CCUS in order to reach net zero by 2050. During the quarter, Linde also announced that it became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. As a signatory, Linde has committed to aligning its strategy and activities with the UNGC’s Ten Principles across human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.”07. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Upside Potential: 20%Citigroup raised the target for Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) stock on October 4 from $42.00 to $46.00, reflecting analyst Scott Gruber's optimistic view on the company's future earnings and operational efficiency. Gruber's ""Buy"" rating is underpinned by his expectation that Halliburton's investments in electronic fracking, coupled with high-quality execution, will result in market share gains and enhance Completion and Production (C&amp;P) margins. Additionally, Gruber anticipates that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) commitment to upgrading tools and improving operational efficiency, especially in remote operations, will contribute to the expansion of Drilling and Evaluation (D&amp;E) margins. Another key factor influencing Gruber's recommendation is his positive forecast for Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) EBITDA in the coming years. He foresees a 6% increase in 2024 EBITDA to $5.55 billion and a 5% rise in 2025 EBITDA to $6.17 billion. Despite projecting a capex of $1.43 billion for the next year, Gruber expects Halliburton's Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion to reach nearly 50%. Taking these factors into account, Gruber has revised the target price for Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) stock to $46, applying a 7.5x multiple to the 2025 EBITDA.Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) provides equipment and services to the global energy industry. Investor concerns surrounding the impact that recent softness in crude oil and natural gas prices would have on the overall level of production activity weighed on the company’s stock in the quarter. However, the recent commitment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce production to balance global supply and demand should support healthy levels of activity specifically within North American shale, where Halliburton is a market leader. Over the longer term, we believe the company also should lay a pivotal role in helping exploration and production companies navigate ongoing productivity declines.”06. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)Upside Potential: 23%On October 4, BS Group increased its target for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) from $72.00 to $74.00, maintaining a ""Neutral"" rating. Despite this upward revision, the current stock price for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is $60.04, reflecting a 3.9% decline after the target adjustment. The augmented target by UBS Group suggests a certain level of optimism regarding Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) future performance. The ""Neutral"" rating indicates a balanced perspective, recognizing stability in Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) current circumstances, even with the revised target. However, the 3.9% reduction in the current stock price prompts consideration of short-term market dynamics that may have influenced this decline. Investors need to delve into potential factors contributing to this immediate movement. This development is pertinent for investors, particularly those interested in the energy sector, as it provides insights into both the positive long-term outlook implied by the target increase and the short-term market dynamics affecting the current stock price. As investors contemplate their strategies, combining the 3.9% immediate price decrease and the potential 23.3% upside from the current price to the new target of $74.00 offers a nuanced perspective. This dual consideration encourages investors to navigate both the complexities of short-term market movements and the broader growth narrative for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets. Suggested articles:14 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Bank Stocks To Buy For Long-Term25 Most Interesting Jobs in the WorldDisclosure.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.18bUS$5.69bUS$5.92bUS$6.22bUS$6.28bUS$6.37bUS$6.47bUS$6.59bUS$6.71bUS$6.84bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 1.05%Est @ 1.38%Est @ 1.61%Est @ 1.77%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$5.7kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.2%) = US$103bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$103b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$43bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$84b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$61.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.363. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

We have also covered interesting insights about the economies of these countries along with their business climate for multinational companies. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the World.Countries with low unemployment rates often have stable economies and a high quality of life for their citizens. These countries typically have well-developed job markets, effective labor policies, and investments in education and training. According to OECD data, the Netherlands was the country with the highest employment rate of 80.15% in 2021. On the other hand, per BLS, Maryland is the state with the lowest unemployment rate in the US. One common feature we observed in these countries is that they tend to have a diverse range of industries and economic sectors. This diversity opens doors for a plethora of employment opportunities and thus, reduces the overall unemployment rate. For instance, countries like Qatar and Bahrain have diversified their economies beyond oil and gas. Another common trend we identified in countries with low unemployment rates is the presence of a favorable business climate for multinational companies. These countries tend to offer regulatory stability that ensures a consistent legal framework for businesses to operate within. Such predictability enables companies to plan long-term strategies and investments while expanding their operations without huge disruptions. Coca Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of such companies. The company has expanded itself to over 200 countries and territories, creating jobs all around the world. Together with its 200 bottling partners, Coca Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has created around 0.7 million jobs. The company also achieved exceptional financial results in the second quarter and first half of 2023. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)’s worldwide reach is a key driver behind its exceptional financial performance.Story continuesNet revenues of the company increased by 6% to $12.0 billion, driven by an 11% growth in organic revenues, with a 10% rise in price/mix and 1% in concentrate sales. Operating income saw a 3% increase, and comparable currency-neutral operating income increased by 15% compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 20.1%, while comparable operating margin stood at 31.6%, both compared to the prior year. Earnings per share (EPS) grew by 34% to $0.59, with comparable EPS growing by 11% to $0.78. Multinationals often benefit countries in which they operate is by investing in large-scale projects that generate hundreds of jobs. For example, Siemens AG (OTC:SI) is poised to be a major job creator in Fort Worth, Texas, with its $133 million manufacturing plant project. In the short term, the company has committed to bringing 167 full-time jobs to the area by the end of 2024 which will provide immediate employment opportunities for the local workforce. However, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY)’s long-term vision will translate into the expansion of the workforce to 715 jobs by the end of 2026 for the local market.  It is worth mentioning that Siemens AG(OTC:SIEGY) also places a strong emphasis on job quality and has thus, set a minimum average annual salary requirement of $63,000 for these positions. This ensures that the jobs created are not only numerous but also offer competitive wages which will result in improved living standards and economic prosperity for the Fort Worth community. The efforts are not limited to just the local communities in the US, in fact, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) is actively putting an effort to generate jobs in both Singapore and China through strategic investments. In Singapore, Siemens plans to establish a modern high-tech factory with an investment of €200 million ($210 million), which is expected to generate 400 new jobs. These jobs will span various functions like advanced manufacturing, supply chain management, quality management, and finance. Not only that but Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) will also expand its digital factory in Chengdu, China, with an investment of €140 million ($147 million) with an aim to create another 400 jobs.

GuatemalaUnemployment Rate: 2.6%Guatemala has a low unemployment rate of 2.6%, but this paradox masks a harsh reality. The unemployment rate is low because many rely on informal, unregulated jobs, while half the population lives in poverty. It is one of the countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the world. 19. KuwaitUnemployment Rate: 2.5%Kuwait's oil wealth, financial policies, and diversification efforts have led to a stable economy with low inflation. In 2021, the GDP of Kuwait stood at $136.8 billion.

In a five-year effort, they protect an area housing over 1,000 plant and animal species, 10% of which are endangered. This will protect different ecosystems that benefits both biodiversity and the livelihoods of over 12,000 Indigenous people. 14. MadagascarUnemployment Rate: 2.1%Madagascar with a 2021 GDP of $14.56 billion, is a market-driven economy. The economy thrives on agriculture, tourism, textiles, and mining, yielding tropical staples like rice and cassava, along with valuable cash crops such as vanilla and coffee. It is one of the countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the world. 13. VanuatuUnemployment Rate: 2.1%Vanuatu has a low unemployment rate owing to its diversified economy which is reliant on agriculture, tourism, offshore finance, and raising cattle.

We will also be taking a look at the countries that provide the best quality tap water in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the World.The Tap Water TreatmentThe tap water dropping down the faucets tends to come from several water sources. This water might come from surface water such as a lake, river, aquifers, a groundwater well, or springs, and usually travels through pipes to the domestic taps. Water that comes directly from such sources contains impurities and germs and hence, it needs to be passed through a series of treatment steps before being available as tap water which can also be consumed safely. You can also view the countries with the most water consumption.In May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the treatment process utilized by the public water systems to refine water and make it drinkable for the local communities. The treatment process begins with coagulation where chemicals are added to the water. The next step is flocculation where water is mixed to form larger particles called flocs. This is followed by sedimentation where water is separated from the solid sediments, flocs, which tend to sit on the bottom. Water filtration follows where the clean water at the top is filtered through FILTER. Ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis can also be used to filter the water to remove even smaller dissolved particles. In the final step known as disinfection, a disinfectant such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or chloramine is added to the filtered water to remove any bacteria or viruses. The water is then transmitted across the pipes to the faucet in homes and buildings. Fluoride might also be added at the end to continue killing bacteria as the water flows through the pipes.Geographical Disparity in Tap Water QualityWhile a clean supply of tap water is deemed safe and even healthy for drinking in some of the developed countries in the world such as America, Switzerland, and Canada, the situation of local water supplies is grim in third-world, developing countries which are most affected by poor water quality and water scarcity. Due to these conditions, The UN has incorporated a goal to achieve equitable access to safe drinking water for all, by 2030. A prime example of this is the water-stressed India which holds only 4% of the total global water resources. On February 14, The World Bank reported that the country has been conserving its groundwater supplies which are a major source of domestic water supplies. Gender differences also come into play as women in rural India travel long distances to get water for households. Even in the urban cities of Shimla and Karnataka, there is a water supply shortage despite the rapidly growing population. The country depends highly on the monsoon season to fulfill its water requirements. The World Bank has been ensuring that rural communities in India can access an adequate water supply through its programs.Story continuesA Potential Alternative: Bottled WaterA potential and popular alternative to traditional tap water is bottled water sold under trademarks. The bottled water industry is quite saturated. Let's take a look at some of the dominant players in this industry.Nestlé Pure Life by Nestle Waters, a subdivision of Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) is one of the market leaders in the global bottled water industry. The brand offers quality drinking water through a process of intensive purification and quality control in more than 40 countries around the world. The company also works with local water-stressed countries to improve water access for them. For instance, it replaced the previous water storage tank with a bigger one and enhanced the pumping efficiency of the local well for the people of Benha, Egypt, in 2022. A filtration system was also installed and the pipes were extended to make the water available in taps. The parent company has also committed to investing 100 million Swiss Francs by 2030 to reduce the carbon footprint of the logistics of its three international water brands, S. Pellegrino, Acqua Panna, and Perrier.Aquafina is another purified water bottle brand, owned by PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). It sells in multiple countries including Canada, America, Spain, Peru, and Morocco. In July 2023, the company reported an analysis of their water quality which revealed that this water exceeded the requirements set by the US EPA and the US Food and Drug Administration. As per the analysis, the residual disinfectants and byproducts of disinfectants were not detected in the water.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) owns Dasani, another popular brand of bottled water that is filtered. The company has operations in more than  200 countries. On July 4, the brand reported that a Coca-Cola plant set up in Monterrey, Mexico supplies clean drinking water through an outdoor faucet to the residents of the area free of any cost. The plant especially fulfilled the local needs for water in 2022 when Monterrey was subject to a severe drought. Thus, the company strives to achieve water security in local communities.Bottled water brands from popular multinationals Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) continue to supply clean drinking water in different parts of the world. Let's take a look at the countries with the cleanest and best tasting tap water.22 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the WorldMethodologyIn order to come up with the list of the top 22 countries with the cleanest and best tasting tap water, we acquired a list of countries with the top scores for safe and healthy drinking water from Yale University’s Environmental Protection Index (EPI). EPI measures country-wise water quality by calculating scores based on the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons as a result of exposure to unclean and unhealthy water in the country. Countries with high scores have the purest and least contaminated drinking water. Please note that tap water is the water available in a country from its own community water system.After shortlisting countries with the top scores, we sourced the proportion of the population with access to safely managed water from a local source including piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, and protected springs. This metric was sourced from UNICEF. Thus, we labeled this metric as the population with access to pure tap water since tap water comes from the aforementioned sources. It is important to note that UNICEF declares drinking water safely managed when it is from a local source in the country which is accessible, available when required, and free from any contamination. Please note that all countries with quality tap water have a higher value for the metric and hence, the metric values for the respective countries are closely placed, up to three decimal places. The data for the chosen metric is from 2022.The top 22 countries with the cleanest, best tasting tap water have been ranked in ascending order of their percentage of population with access to pure tap water, as of 2022. 22 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the World22.

141,9734eaf6-44e0-3a4f-936e-4334a8fdcf74,VLO,2023-10-09,5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-impressive-ev-105500457.html,1696848900,STORY,"['PVH', 'TITN', 'AIR', 'UNM', 'VLO']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm’s equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Titan Machinery Inc. TITN, PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, AAR Corp. AIR and Valero Energy Corporation VLO are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:Titan Machinery operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment dealer locations in North America and Europe.

143,28fcc41a-5d51-3182-a036-7c797c1e221c,UNH,2023-10-09,Who profits most from America’s baffling health-care system?,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/profits-most-america-baffling-health-174845650.html,1696787325,STORY,"['UNH', 'CVS']","[On October 4, more than 75,000 employees of Kaiser Permanente, a large health-care chain, began a three-day strike. The walkout was the biggest in the history of America’s health sector, and called attention to the staffing shortages plaguing the country’s hospitals and clinics.In the same week, 10 drugmakers said they would negotiate medicine prices with Medicare, the public health-care system for the elderly, following legislation which all but forced them to. It will be the first time that companies have haggled over prices with the government.These events are symptoms of the deeper malaise in America’s dysfunctional health-care system. The country spends about $4.3 trillion a year on keeping citizens in good nick. That is equivalent to 17% of GDP, twice as much as the average in other rich economies. And yet American adults live shorter lives and American infants die more often than in similarly affluent places.Pharmaceutical firms and hospitals attract much of the public ire for the inflated costs. Much less attention is paid to a small number of middlemen who extract far bigger rents from the system’s complexity.Over the past decade, these firms have quietly increased their presence in America’s vast health-care industry. They do not make drugs and have not, until recently, treated patients. They are the intermediaries—insurers, pharmacies, drug distributors and pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs)—sitting between patients and their treatments.In 2022, the combined revenue of the nine biggest middlemen—call them ""Big Health""—equated to around 45% of America’s health-care bill, up from 25% in 2013. Big Health accounts for eight of the top 25 companies by revenue in the S&amp;P 500 index of America’s leading stocks, compared with four for Big Tech and none for Big Pharma.After a person reaches 65 years of age, the average healthcare costs are over $11,000 per person, per year. (Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) (Robert Nickelsberg via Getty Images)Big Health began as a constellation of oligopolies. Four private health insurers account for 50% of all enrolments. The biggest, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), made $324 billion in revenues last year—behind only Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and ExxonMobil (XOM)—and $25 billion in pre-tax profit. Its 151 million customers represent nearly half of all Americans. Its market capitalisation has doubled in the past five years, to $486 billion, making it America’s 12th-most-valuable company.Story continuesFour pharmacy giants generate 60% of America’s drug-dispensing revenues. The mightiest of them, CVS Health (CVS), alone made up a quarter of all pharmacy sales. Just three PBMs handled 80% of all prescription claims. And a whopping 92% of all drugs flow through three wholesalers.With little room left to grow in their core businesses, and trustbusters blocking attempts to buy direct rivals, the oligopolists have in recent years expanded into other bits of the health-care supply chain.Besides adding to the top line, such vertical integration is also juicing margins. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 limited the profits of health insurers to between 15% and 20% of collected premiums, depending on the size of the health plan. But it imposed no restrictions on what physicians or other intermediaries can earn.The law created an incentive for insurers to acquire clinics, pharmacies and the like, and to steer customers to them rather than rival providers. The strategy channels revenue from the profit-capped insurance business to uncapped subsidiaries, which in theory could allow insurers to keep more of the premiums paid by patients.According to Irving Levin Associates, a research firm, between 2013 and August 2023 the nine health-care giants spent around $325 billion on over 130 mergers and acquisitions. Some of these deals have pushed the firms deeper into each other’s turf.In 2017, CVS offered $78 billion for Aetna, a large health insurer and a competitor of UnitedHealth’s. The following year Cigna (CI), another big insurer, swallowed Express Scripts, a big PBM, for $67 billion. In 2022, UnitedHealth paid $13 billion for Change Healthcare, a data-analytics firm which processes insurance claims for large parts of the industry, including UnitedHealth’s rivals.Both UnitedHealth and CVS have been buying up health-care providers, too. Optum Health, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, has spent over $23 billion on such transactions in the past six years, and now treats more than 20 million patients through a network of 2,200 clinics. It has more doctors on its books—70,000 employed or affiliated physicians—than the biggest hospital chains in the country. CVS runs 1,100 or so neighbourhood clinics, and this year alone paid $18 billion for two companies focused on the lucrative elderly-care market.Nurse practitioner takes temperature of patient at a MinuteClinic at CVS drug store, North Brunswick, New Jersey. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Industry executives say that bringing all parts of patient care—primary-care clinics, pharmacy services, PBMs and insurance—under one roof is beneficial for all.In the old fee-for-service model, Big Health argues, doctors or hospitals are paid for each service they provide, encouraging them to perform as many as possible and charge as much as they can. If doctors and insurance companies are part of the same business, by contrast, incentives should be aligned and overall costs should be lower.That, at least, is the theory. And there is some truth to it. Despite its recent labour troubles, Kaiser Permanente has historically been hailed as a role model for efficient and high-quality health care. Its business, with 39 hospitals and over 24,000 doctors, is highly integrated, with Kaiser’s insurance plans covering members’ treatment at its hospitals and clinics. This April, Kaiser announced it would acquire Geisinger Health, a Pennsylvania-based health system, to expand its model of integrated care to more states.Yet vertical integration can have adverse side-effects. For example, many studies have found that after hospitals acquire physician practices, prices increase but quality of care does not. A health-care company that controls many aspects of patient care could raise prices for rivals wishing to access its network. Some also worry about physicians being nudged towards offering the cheapest treatment to patients, lowering the quality of care.There is as yet no evidence of trouble with the model, argues Richard Frank of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. But elsewhere in Big Health, signs of oligopolistic behaviour are already on display.Consider PBMs. These middlemen are in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators for their role in determining drug prices. At least four different bills that seek to regulate PBMs are making their way through Congress. For almost two decades, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), America’s main antitrust agency, pushed back against efforts to increase oversight of PBMs, arguing that such moves would harm consumers. In July 2022, however, the FTC changed tack and launched an investigation into the business practices of the largest PBMS.At issue is PBMs’ opaque pricing, which takes a drug’s list price and shaves off discounts that the PBM wrangles from drugmakers.PBMs claim that they are a counterweight to Big Pharma. But critics argue that large PBMs don’t pass on the discounts to the health plans, instead keeping much of the difference for themselves, and limit access to treatments that are less profitable for them. In August, Blue Cross of California, a regional health insurer, ditched CVS’s PBM in favour of smaller firms to save on drug costs for its nearly 5 million members.Indeed, America’s health-care intermediaries are unusually profitable. Research by Neeraj Sood of the University of Southern California and colleagues found that intermediaries in the the health-care supply chain earned annualised excess returns—defined as the difference between their return on invested capital and their weighted average cost of capital—of 5.9% between 2013 and 2018, compared with 3.6% for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.Big health’s giant pool of excess profits is at last attracting newcomers. Upstart health insurers like Bright Health Group and Oscar Health have positioned themselves as a transparent and consumer-friendly alternative to the old guard. Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, an online pharmacy started by the eponymous billionaire, bypasses the middlemen by buying cheaper generics directly from manufacturers and selling them to consumers at a fixed 15% mark-up.Perhaps the biggest disruption to Big Health could come from Amazon. In 2021, its health-care ambitions suffered a setback owing to the closure of Haven Healthcare, a not-for-profit joint venture with JPMorgan Chase, America’s biggest bank, and Berkshire Hathaway, its biggest investment firm. Haven had aimed to reduce health-care costs for the three firms’ own employees.But despite Haven’s failure, Amazon is still expanding its health-care business. Last year it paid $3.9 billion for One Medical, a primary-care provider. It also runs Amazon Clinic, an online service offering virtual consultations, and RxPass, which lets members of its Prime subscription service buy unlimited generic medications for a small fee. John Love, who heads Amazon’s pharmacy business, believes that the tech giant’s focus on customer experience, combined with its vast logistics network, makes it well-suited to shake up the industry.A One Medical office in Oakland, California. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)So far the newcomers’ impact has been muted. Lisa Gill of JPMorgan Chase reckons that most of them underestimate the complexity of the business of health. The entrenched firms have built their networks of doctors, hospitals, insurers and drugmakers over decades. Replicating that takes time and institutional knowledge.Mr Cuban admits that it is difficult to get drugmakers to list branded drugs on his pharmacy, as they are wary of upsetting the large PBMs. And without branded drugs and the support of large health insurers, his firm’s reach remains small.The cap on insurers’ profits makes life tough for upstarts in that business, who struggle to compete against the negotiating power of the integrated giants. Even Haven, which represented its three backers’ 1.2 million American employees, did not command enough market power to compel lower prices from health-care providers.Amazon’s pharmacy business has yet to break into America’s top 15 pharmacy chains. Big Tech may be powerful. But for now even it bows before Big Health.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

145,012e758f-f1bd-35de-bf70-d06934f8b024,PG,2023-10-09,25 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-countries-lowest-unemployment-rates-112649895.html,1696850809,STORY,"['INTC', 'SIEGY', 'KO', 'PG']","[In this article, we will look at the 25 countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the world. We have also covered interesting insights about the economies of these countries along with their business climate for multinational companies. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the World.Countries with low unemployment rates often have stable economies and a high quality of life for their citizens. These countries typically have well-developed job markets, effective labor policies, and investments in education and training. According to OECD data, the Netherlands was the country with the highest employment rate of 80.15% in 2021. On the other hand, per BLS, Maryland is the state with the lowest unemployment rate in the US. One common feature we observed in these countries is that they tend to have a diverse range of industries and economic sectors. This diversity opens doors for a plethora of employment opportunities and thus, reduces the overall unemployment rate. For instance, countries like Qatar and Bahrain have diversified their economies beyond oil and gas. Another common trend we identified in countries with low unemployment rates is the presence of a favorable business climate for multinational companies. These countries tend to offer regulatory stability that ensures a consistent legal framework for businesses to operate within. Such predictability enables companies to plan long-term strategies and investments while expanding their operations without huge disruptions. Coca Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of such companies. The company has expanded itself to over 200 countries and territories, creating jobs all around the world. Together with its 200 bottling partners, Coca Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has created around 0.7 million jobs. The company also achieved exceptional financial results in the second quarter and first half of 2023. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)’s worldwide reach is a key driver behind its exceptional financial performance.Story continuesNet revenues of the company increased by 6% to $12.0 billion, driven by an 11% growth in organic revenues, with a 10% rise in price/mix and 1% in concentrate sales. Operating income saw a 3% increase, and comparable currency-neutral operating income increased by 15% compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 20.1%, while comparable operating margin stood at 31.6%, both compared to the prior year. Earnings per share (EPS) grew by 34% to $0.59, with comparable EPS growing by 11% to $0.78. Multinationals often benefit countries in which they operate is by investing in large-scale projects that generate hundreds of jobs. For example, Siemens AG (OTC:SI) is poised to be a major job creator in Fort Worth, Texas, with its $133 million manufacturing plant project. In the short term, the company has committed to bringing 167 full-time jobs to the area by the end of 2024 which will provide immediate employment opportunities for the local workforce. However, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY)’s long-term vision will translate into the expansion of the workforce to 715 jobs by the end of 2026 for the local market.  It is worth mentioning that Siemens AG(OTC:SIEGY) also places a strong emphasis on job quality and has thus, set a minimum average annual salary requirement of $63,000 for these positions. This ensures that the jobs created are not only numerous but also offer competitive wages which will result in improved living standards and economic prosperity for the Fort Worth community. The efforts are not limited to just the local communities in the US, in fact, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) is actively putting an effort to generate jobs in both Singapore and China through strategic investments. In Singapore, Siemens plans to establish a modern high-tech factory with an investment of €200 million ($210 million), which is expected to generate 400 new jobs. These jobs will span various functions like advanced manufacturing, supply chain management, quality management, and finance. Not only that but Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) will also expand its digital factory in Chengdu, China, with an investment of €140 million ($147 million) with an aim to create another 400 jobs. Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) is also one of the Top AI and Robotics Companies Transforming the Agriculture Sector.25 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the Worldkurhan/Shutterstock.comMethodologyTo list the countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the world, we utilized the unemployment rates provided by the World Bank, ensuring that the list is based on reliable and objective statistics. We have also made our list more descriptive by discussing respective GDPs for many countries. The unemployment rates were acquired from World Bank data for the most recent year, i.e., 2022, for all 25 countries.Here is a list of countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the world:25. JapanUnemployment Rate: 2.6%Japan is one of the most developed countries in the world and especially in Asia. In 2021, the GDP of Japan stood at $4.23 trillion.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of global inflation and the cost of living crisis, you may go to 5 Places to Retire for $1,000 a Month.Global Inflation and the Cost of Living CrisisAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Reports 2023, the most severe global risk crisis that the world will be facing for the next two years is the “cost-of-living” crisis. The report states that,“Governments and central banks could face stubborn inflationary pressures over the next two years, not least given the potential for a prolonged war in Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic and economic warfare spurring supply chain decoupling,”Due to the global cost-of-living crisis, many countries have been facing double and triple-digit year-on-year food price inflation. The global food and energy price surges caused by the war in Ukraine has, in turn, led an estimated 71 million people to fall into poverty, notes a 2022 report by the United Nations Global Development Programme. Many economies such as the USA have had inflation reach 40-year highs. The International Monetary Fund reveals that food inflation has been responsible for eroding global living standards at the same rate as inflation of all consumption did in the five years before the pandemic.The World Food Programme further highlights that more than 345 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity in 2023. Even worse, 129,000 people are expected to face famine in places such as Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso, and South Sudan. The latest World Bank figures reveal that food price inflation between May and August 2023 remains high for countries around the world. 69.6% of high-income countries, 64% of upper-middle-income countries, 86.4% of lower-middle-income countries, and 52.6% of low-income countries face high levels of inflation. Inflation levels in many of these countries have breached the double-digit threshold, intensifying the economic challenges that these countries face.Story continuesAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, what has exacerbated the food insecurity situation around the world, many countries have been putting food trade restrictions as a means to increase domestic supply and reduce prices. As of September 2023, a total of 19 countries have implemented 25 food export bans, while 7 countries have implemented 12 export-limiting measures, reports the World Bank.Role of Corporations in Fueling InflationBesides the lingering impacts of the Ukraine war and supply chain bottlenecks, major US corporations have also been responsible for the rising levels of inflation around the world. According to a Unite investigation, nearly 60% of inflation in 2021 has been because of corporate profits. Further, New York Times reveals that some of the biggest corporations have said they do not plan to change their course when it comes to increasing their prices. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are some of the companies that have raised their prices throughout the year. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the consumer goods giant, made a series of price hikes in 2023 that led to an organic sales growth of 7%.Moreover, in Q4 2023, sales for the company increased by 5% to $20.6 billion. Companies such as The PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have been able to maintain these higher prices, even after inflation has started to moderate, by pitching their offerings as “premium products”. “Irresistible superiority” is the term the consumer goods company has used to describe the high value their products offer to customers. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its average prices by 15% in the three months ending June 2023.""In developed markets, we see consumers still really doing quite well... they may be pulling back to some degree on the bigger ticket purchases... but we are an affordable luxury... people are still buying our products at a healthy rate,"" Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters.As a result, Q2 2023 saw net income boost to $2.75 million, and the company anticipates its full-year earnings to be up by 12%. Many food corporations have also been benefitting from inflation-driven price increases, such as Conagra, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). Profits for The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), the multinational food company that makes Kool-Aid and Jell-O, in Q4 2022 were up by nearly 450%. Q2 2023 saw the company raising its prices by 11% year-over-year.Similarly, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), one of the largest meat companies in the US, also saw its profits double between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022. In recent news, with chicken prices hitting record highs in US grocery stores, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) and similar companies are all set to benefit from a boost in margins as customers divert to chicken from beef and pork due to inflationary pressures.Due to the current cost-of-living crisis, the hardest hit demographic amongst all are retirees with fixed earnings. This demographic is increasingly looking for options to retire to, stretching their retirement incomes the farthest they can.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks. In the first half of 2023, dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500 saw their stock prices increase by approximately 12%, while those that didn't pay dividends experienced a much higher increase of 37%, as of August.Even though dividend stocks haven't shown strong performance recently, many investors remain determined to include these stocks in their portfolios because they offer a consistent source of income. When investors choose to invest in dividend stocks, they often prioritize high dividend yields. However, it's important to note that excessively high dividend yields can sometimes indicate financial instability or other underlying issues within the company. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about the importance of dividend yields in this Morningstar article. Here are some comments from the analyst:“It’s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps—companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.”Analysts recommend paying more attention to companies that have consistently increased their dividends over a long time frame, rather than just looking at stocks with high dividend yields. To regularly pay dividends, a company must generate surplus cash beyond its operational needs. Therefore, dividend-paying companies are typically well-established, with a steady income and enough extra cash flow. Choosing a long-term dividend growth allows for the potential to increase returns through compounding. Dividends played a big role in the S&amp;P 500 Index's returns in the last 30 years, with reinvested dividends contributing to slightly more than 42% of its overall gains. Some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their dividends over the years include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Story continuesIn addition to yields and growth, investors often consider a company's dividend frequency when evaluating its suitability for their investment strategy, as it can impact the regularity and predictability of income from their investments. Monthly dividends are appealing to some investors because they help with better money management. With smaller, more frequent payments, it's easier for investors to budget and plan their finances. In this article, we have discussed the highest-paying monthly dividend stocks.16 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we looked at stocks that pay monthly dividends.

Warren Buffett isn’t one of them. Buffett’s most recent 13F filing shows he bet big on the housing market. Buffett dove headfirst into the sector and bought shares of three homebuilders. New National Association of Realtors data, however, doesn’t discount a housing market crash. It shows existing home sales in August fell to their lowest point since the start of the year. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMortgage interest rates, which hit 7.31% last week, are their highest since 2000.Despite that, the average U.S. home price of $495,100 remains stubbornly high. Although down from last year’s record $552,600, it’s more than double the average $212,100 price from 2000. High interest rates and high home prices are not normal. Homebuilders do best in falling rate environments. It suggests a housing market crash could occur in 2024. Investors can only ask, did Buffett read the market wrong? Let’s look at each of the builders he bought and see why he might have decided now was a good time to buy,whether there’s a housing market crash or not.Lennar (LEN)Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screenSource: madamF via ShutterstockThe homebuilder Buffett bought the fewest shares of is Lennar (NYSE:LEN)(NYSE:LEN-B). He purchased 150,000 shares worth $18 million. It is the second largest homebuilder by the number of homes delivered and set to capitalize on the housing preferences of homebuyers.In its last investor presentation, Lennar noted Florida was its biggest market, with 29% of its 50,000 or so total deliveries. Lennar is also a diversified homebuilder. With a presence in 19 states, it offers homes across the full spectrum of first-time, move-up, active adult, and luxury. The average price of its homes is $448,000, below the national average and down from almost $500,000 last year.Deliveries and new home orders are showing strength, despite conditions. Year to date deliveries are up 6% to 49,292 while new orders were up 8% to over 51,700. Story continuesLennar’s stock is down 14% from its July peak of $133 per share. It also pays a 1.1% dividend.NVR (NVR)The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.Source: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.comBuffett bought $67 million worth of NVR (NYSE:NVR) stock. It’s the smallest of the three builders with a market cap below $20 billion. Unlike Lennar, it doesn’t pay a dividend. The stock is also down only 7% from the all-time highs it hit this summer.NVR focuses on building homes in 15 states, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwestern regions. The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area represents 21% of total revenue, however. It sells homes under three brand names. Ryan Homes, NV Homes and Heartland Homes each is a different quality level. Its average selling price is $447,300, not much different from Lennar.It’s also seeing business pick up even though everything says that shouldn’t be happening if there’s a housing market crash on the horizon. New orders are up 27% in the latest quarter just as cancellation rates are falling, dropping to 11% from 14% a year ago.One thing that sets NVR apart is that it typically doesn’t buy land to build on until it’s ready to build. This asset-lite model makes it much more flexible to changing market conditions and keeps its capital requirements lower than the competition. Thus, where Lennar’s trailing return on equity runs around 18%, NVR’s stands at a robust 45%. It’s likely this is one of the reasons Buffett likes this builder.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comD.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) is both the biggest homebuilder in the U.S. and the one Buffett spent the most on. He bought almost 6 million shares at around $121 per share for a total value of approximately $695 million. NAR says there are 1.1 million unsold existing homes, or just 3.3 months’ worth of inventory. It’s considered a shortage when there is less than a six-month supply of existing homes for sale.It’s why Buffett was attracted to the sector. If existing homeowners aren’t putting their houses on the market, then new home builders will benefit. It explains rising new orders and deliveries with falling cancellation rates.D.R. Horton orders surged 37% from the year ago quarter. Its average selling price was $381,100, the cheapest of the three.Ultimately, it looks like Buffett didn’t read the market wrong at all. In fact, he read it just right. Because these are otherwise strong, financially secure businesses, they will survive even if the housing market crash happens. On the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Rich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

Kirby added that the US wanted to press ahead with diplomacy to normalize ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel after the Hamas attack, which further inflamed tensions in the Middle East.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Top US General Warns Iran to Stay Out of ConflictSchumer Confronts Xi on Israel-Hamas Stance in Rare MeetingHamas Got Around Israel’s Surveillance Prowess by Going DarkBrutality of Surprise Attack Unites Israel Around One Goal: Crush HamasXi’s Reply to Hamas Attack Shows China’s Limit as PeacemakerIn Washington, President Joe Biden said at least 11 American citizens had died, and “it is likely” that others were being held hostage by Hamas. Biden plans to speak about the attacks on Tuesday. Israeli forces carried out strikes in the Gaza Strip from the air and the sea and the top US general warned Iran to stay out of the fight.The attacks on Israel by the militant group Hamas, which began Saturday, have killed more than 900 Israelis, mostly civilians. At least 600 Palestinians have also died. Vowing retaliation in a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the response had “only started,” and “what we will do to the enemy will echo down through generations.”Read more: Hamas Threatens to Kill Israeli Hostages as Rhetoric EscalatesAll time stamps are for IsraelBiden Asked to Weigh Joint Ukraine, Israel Aid Package (6:09 a.m.)Some US lawmakers have proposed the Biden administration pursue a joint aid package for Israel and Ukraine that would capitalize on broad bipartisan support for the Jewish state to overcome opposition from some Republicans to continued funding for Kyiv.White House officials described the discussion as premature, noting that Biden could tap current authorizations to provide immediate aid. In addition, no aid package can advance until the House settles on a speaker.Story continuesUS Joint Chiefs Chairman Warns Iran to Stay Out (5:14 a.m.)The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown Jr., warned Iran to “not get involved” in the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Financial Times reported.“We want to send a pretty strong message,” Brown said while en route to a meeting in Brussels to discuss Ukraine. “We do not want this to broaden, and the idea is for Iran to get that message loud and clear.”The US is sending the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean to bolster deterrence efforts. The group includes an aircraft carrier, a guided missile cruiser and guided missile destroyers.Congress’s Aid for Israel Hinges Upon Speaker Selection (3:10 a.m.)Key members of the US House of Representatives are considering ideas for assistance to Israel, but the process won’t advance until lawmakers resolve a political fight to determine the next leader of the chamber. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul said Monday the lack of a House speaker plays into the hands of the country’s enemies.The chamber cannot conduct much normal legislative business until a new person for the top job is elected. McCaul said the first step would be a resolution condemning Hamas. Congress then, he added, should consider replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system, as well as supplying precision munitions and ammunition. House lawmakers are scheduled to have a classified briefing on Wednesday with officials from the State Department, Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Seven Argentines Among the Victims (3:10 a.m.)Seven Argentines were killed in the Hamas attacks and 15 are missing, President Alberto Fernandez’s government said Monday. The country, home to one of the world’s largest Jewish communities, has strong links with Israel.Saturday’s events led the Argentine government to order heightened security around buildings and property of the Jewish community in Argentina. The Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was destroyed in a 1992 suicide bombing that killed 29 people. Two years later, also in Buenos Aires, 85 people were killed in the suicide bombing of a Jewish community center. Argentina has accused the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah and Iran of being behind that attack.FBI Joins Search for Missing Americans (2:20 a.m.)The Federal Bureau of Investigation is working with Israel and security agencies to find Americans who haven’t been accounted for and determine if any were kidnapped following the attacks on Israel from the militant group Hamas.“FBI personnel are working with our partners on the ground to locate and identify any impacted Americans,” the bureau said in a statement Monday. “Reports of deceased, injured, or missing Americans are being treated with the utmost urgency and aggressively investigated.”Leaders Affirm Support for Israel After Call (1:25 a.m.)The leaders of the US, Germany, France, Italy and the UK spoke in a call on Monday and afterward released a statement that renewed their support for Israel and condemned Hamas “and its appalling acts of terrorism.”“Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities,” Biden along with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the statement. “We further emphasize that this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage.”Israel Attacks Gaza From Air and Sea (12:10 a.m.The Israeli Defense Force said Monday night that attacks against the Gaza Strip were proceeding, from the sea as well as the air. Israeli aircraft hit a building where, according to an IDF statement, Hamas carried out operations within a mosque. Another mosque that concealed the militant group’s operations headquarters and a tunnel shaft were also targets of the latest Israeli attacks.Two militants were killed when aircraft attacked what the IDF described as a weapons depot and meeting house of another group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Some Americans ‘Likely’ Were Abducted, Biden Says (11:35 p.m.)Biden, in a statement on Monday, mourned the Americans killed in the attacks, and pointed out that others are missing. “The pain these families have endured, the enormity of their loss, and the agony of those still awaiting information is unfathomable,” he said. “This is not some distant tragedy. The ties between Israel and the United States run deep.”Turning to the possibility that some Americans had been abducted, the president said had “directed my team to work with their Israeli counterparts on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts.”US Lacks Evidence Iran Participated Directly in Attacks (10:51 p.m.)The US doesn’t have any specific intelligence or evidence that points to direct participation by Iran in the attacks against Israel, National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said on MSNBC.“That said, of course, Iran has long supported Hamas and other terrorist networks throughout the region with resources capabilities training,” Kirby said. “And so in that regard, clearly, Iran is complicit here, but in terms of specific evidence on this on these sets of attacks, no, we don’t have anything.”Hezbollah Says It Struck Two Targets in Israel (10:46 p.m.)The Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon said it launched guided missiles and mortar shells into Israel, striking two targets after three of its members were killed in an Israeli attack earlier Monday. Israel said there were no injuries in the Hezbollah attack, to which it retaliated with artillery fire.The exchange further escalated the possibility of a second conflict opening up along the Israeli-Lebanese border.EU to Review Aid for Palestinians After Suspension (10:34 p.m.)The European Union said late Monday that it’s urgently reviewing the bloc’s assistance to the Palestinians after several member states protested an earlier announcement that aid would be suspended.EU foreign ministers are due to discuss the implications of the deadly attack by Hamas, including for the bloc’s aid to Palestine, at an emergency gathering Tuesday afternoon.Gaza Health Ministry Cites Death Toll There at 687 (9:35 p.m.)The health ministry in Gaza cited a death toll there of 687, including 140 children and 105 women, with 3,726 people injured.Iran’s Role in Attack Far From Clear, Analyst Bremmer Says (9 p.m.)It’s not yet clear whether Iran was behind Hamas’s deadly assault on Israel, Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer said, while noting that Tehran has long offered the Palestinian group diplomatic cover, weapons and financial support.“I would be very surprised if they were unaware of the attack, but there’s a very big gap between unaware and orchestrated,” Bremmer said on Bloomberg Television. He also said he “firmly” believes Israel will launch a ground invasion of Gaza “to remove Hamas leadership.”It’s Most Jews Murdered in One Day Since Holocaust: Herzog (8:28 p.m.)Not since the Holocaust have so many Jews been murdered on a single day, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said.

It'll be another critical cycle, particularly as the market tries to extend impressive YTD gains.Outside of the big banks, notable companies scheduled to unveil quarterly releases next week include PepsiCo, Delta Air Lines and UnitedHealth Group. Let's take a deeper dive into what's expected out of each.PepsiCoPEP shares have faced adverse price action over the last several months following an impressive start to 2023, down roughly 13% during the period. Analysts have primarily kept their earnings expectations unchanged for the upcoming release, with the $2.17 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down just a penny over the last several months.The consumer staples giant regularly beats quarterly expectations, exceeding both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue estimates in six consecutive releases.Still, negative sentiment has taken hold of near-term price action, with shares recently being rejected at the 200-day moving average and heading lower.It's worth noting that the company upped its FY23 view following its latest quarterly print, citing continued strong business momentum. Our consensus quarterly revenue estimate for PEP stands at $23.4 billion, 6% higher than the year-ago figure.PepsiCo, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Tuesday, October 10th, before the market's open.Delta Air LinesDelta Air Lines shares have traded somewhat similarly to PEP over the last three months, facing adverse price action following a melt-up during early summer. Analysts moved their expectations lower following a filing on September 14th, with the $1.96 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 17% over the last several months.Story continuesDAL shares sold off following its latest release despite posting record quarterly revenue and profitability, likely a reflection of profit-taking following the above-mentioned summer melt-up.Rising fuel costs throughout the period undoubtedly impacted DAL's quarter to be released. As mentioned above, in September, the company updated previous guidance given in the latest earnings call, now expecting fuel prices of $2.75 - $2.90 per gallon ($2.50 -$2.70 per gallon previously). Our consensus estimate for average fuel price per gallon presently sits at $2.88, 14% higher than $2.52 per gallon in 2023 Q2.Delta Air Lines, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Thursday, October 12th, before the market's open.UnitedHealth GroupUnlike those above, UNH shares have seen favorable action over the last several months, tacking on 14% in value and outperforming the general market. Analysts have taken their expectations modestly lower for the quarter to be released, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 2% since July.The company posted strong balanced growth in its latest release, with both segments posting double-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates. Regarding expectations, UNH exceeded both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue forecasts, continuing its consistent nature. And given its first-half performance, UNH upped its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $24.70 - $25.00 per share.UnitedHealth, a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will report on Friday, October 13th, before the market's open.Bottom LineEarnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, with companies pulling the curtain back and unveiling what's transpired behind closed doors.And next week, the quarterly reports will really start rolling in.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of global inflation and the cost of living crisis, you may go to 5 Places to Retire for $1,000 a Month.Global Inflation and the Cost of Living CrisisAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Reports 2023, the most severe global risk crisis that the world will be facing for the next two years is the “cost-of-living” crisis. The report states that,“Governments and central banks could face stubborn inflationary pressures over the next two years, not least given the potential for a prolonged war in Ukraine, continued bottlenecks from a lingering pandemic and economic warfare spurring supply chain decoupling,”Due to the global cost-of-living crisis, many countries have been facing double and triple-digit year-on-year food price inflation. The global food and energy price surges caused by the war in Ukraine has, in turn, led an estimated 71 million people to fall into poverty, notes a 2022 report by the United Nations Global Development Programme. Many economies such as the USA have had inflation reach 40-year highs. The International Monetary Fund reveals that food inflation has been responsible for eroding global living standards at the same rate as inflation of all consumption did in the five years before the pandemic.The World Food Programme further highlights that more than 345 million people are facing high levels of food insecurity in 2023. Even worse, 129,000 people are expected to face famine in places such as Mali, Somalia, Burkina Faso, and South Sudan. The latest World Bank figures reveal that food price inflation between May and August 2023 remains high for countries around the world. 69.6% of high-income countries, 64% of upper-middle-income countries, 86.4% of lower-middle-income countries, and 52.6% of low-income countries face high levels of inflation. Inflation levels in many of these countries have breached the double-digit threshold, intensifying the economic challenges that these countries face.Story continuesAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, what has exacerbated the food insecurity situation around the world, many countries have been putting food trade restrictions as a means to increase domestic supply and reduce prices. As of September 2023, a total of 19 countries have implemented 25 food export bans, while 7 countries have implemented 12 export-limiting measures, reports the World Bank.Role of Corporations in Fueling InflationBesides the lingering impacts of the Ukraine war and supply chain bottlenecks, major US corporations have also been responsible for the rising levels of inflation around the world. According to a Unite investigation, nearly 60% of inflation in 2021 has been because of corporate profits. Further, New York Times reveals that some of the biggest corporations have said they do not plan to change their course when it comes to increasing their prices. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are some of the companies that have raised their prices throughout the year. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), the consumer goods giant, made a series of price hikes in 2023 that led to an organic sales growth of 7%.Moreover, in Q4 2023, sales for the company increased by 5% to $20.6 billion. Companies such as The PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have been able to maintain these higher prices, even after inflation has started to moderate, by pitching their offerings as “premium products”. “Irresistible superiority” is the term the consumer goods company has used to describe the high value their products offer to customers. Similarly, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its average prices by 15% in the three months ending June 2023.""In developed markets, we see consumers still really doing quite well... they may be pulling back to some degree on the bigger ticket purchases... but we are an affordable luxury... people are still buying our products at a healthy rate,"" Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters.As a result, Q2 2023 saw net income boost to $2.75 million, and the company anticipates its full-year earnings to be up by 12%. Many food corporations have also been benefitting from inflation-driven price increases, such as Conagra, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). Profits for The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), the multinational food company that makes Kool-Aid and Jell-O, in Q4 2022 were up by nearly 450%. Q2 2023 saw the company raising its prices by 11% year-over-year.Similarly, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), one of the largest meat companies in the US, also saw its profits double between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022. In recent news, with chicken prices hitting record highs in US grocery stores, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) and similar companies are all set to benefit from a boost in margins as customers divert to chicken from beef and pork due to inflationary pressures.Due to the current cost-of-living crisis, the hardest hit demographic amongst all are retirees with fixed earnings.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks. In the first half of 2023, dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500 saw their stock prices increase by approximately 12%, while those that didn't pay dividends experienced a much higher increase of 37%, as of August.Even though dividend stocks haven't shown strong performance recently, many investors remain determined to include these stocks in their portfolios because they offer a consistent source of income. When investors choose to invest in dividend stocks, they often prioritize high dividend yields. However, it's important to note that excessively high dividend yields can sometimes indicate financial instability or other underlying issues within the company. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about the importance of dividend yields in this Morningstar article. Here are some comments from the analyst:“It’s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps—companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.”Analysts recommend paying more attention to companies that have consistently increased their dividends over a long time frame, rather than just looking at stocks with high dividend yields. To regularly pay dividends, a company must generate surplus cash beyond its operational needs. Therefore, dividend-paying companies are typically well-established, with a steady income and enough extra cash flow. Choosing a long-term dividend growth allows for the potential to increase returns through compounding. Dividends played a big role in the S&amp;P 500 Index's returns in the last 30 years, with reinvested dividends contributing to slightly more than 42% of its overall gains. Some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their dividends over the years include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Story continuesIn addition to yields and growth, investors often consider a company's dividend frequency when evaluating its suitability for their investment strategy, as it can impact the regularity and predictability of income from their investments. Monthly dividends are appealing to some investors because they help with better money management. With smaller, more frequent payments, it's easier for investors to budget and plan their finances. In this article, we have discussed the highest-paying monthly dividend stocks.16 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend Stocks Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we looked at stocks that pay monthly dividends.

We will also be taking a look at the countries that provide the best quality tap water in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the World.The Tap Water TreatmentThe tap water dropping down the faucets tends to come from several water sources. This water might come from surface water such as a lake, river, aquifers, a groundwater well, or springs, and usually travels through pipes to the domestic taps. Water that comes directly from such sources contains impurities and germs and hence, it needs to be passed through a series of treatment steps before being available as tap water which can also be consumed safely. You can also view the countries with the most water consumption.In May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the treatment process utilized by the public water systems to refine water and make it drinkable for the local communities. The treatment process begins with coagulation where chemicals are added to the water. The next step is flocculation where water is mixed to form larger particles called flocs. This is followed by sedimentation where water is separated from the solid sediments, flocs, which tend to sit on the bottom. Water filtration follows where the clean water at the top is filtered through FILTER. Ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis can also be used to filter the water to remove even smaller dissolved particles. In the final step known as disinfection, a disinfectant such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or chloramine is added to the filtered water to remove any bacteria or viruses. The water is then transmitted across the pipes to the faucet in homes and buildings. Fluoride might also be added at the end to continue killing bacteria as the water flows through the pipes.Geographical Disparity in Tap Water QualityWhile a clean supply of tap water is deemed safe and even healthy for drinking in some of the developed countries in the world such as America, Switzerland, and Canada, the situation of local water supplies is grim in third-world, developing countries which are most affected by poor water quality and water scarcity. Due to these conditions, The UN has incorporated a goal to achieve equitable access to safe drinking water for all, by 2030. A prime example of this is the water-stressed India which holds only 4% of the total global water resources. On February 14, The World Bank reported that the country has been conserving its groundwater supplies which are a major source of domestic water supplies. Gender differences also come into play as women in rural India travel long distances to get water for households. Even in the urban cities of Shimla and Karnataka, there is a water supply shortage despite the rapidly growing population. The country depends highly on the monsoon season to fulfill its water requirements. The World Bank has been ensuring that rural communities in India can access an adequate water supply through its programs.Story continuesA Potential Alternative: Bottled WaterA potential and popular alternative to traditional tap water is bottled water sold under trademarks. The bottled water industry is quite saturated. Let's take a look at some of the dominant players in this industry.Nestlé Pure Life by Nestle Waters, a subdivision of Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) is one of the market leaders in the global bottled water industry. The brand offers quality drinking water through a process of intensive purification and quality control in more than 40 countries around the world. The company also works with local water-stressed countries to improve water access for them. For instance, it replaced the previous water storage tank with a bigger one and enhanced the pumping efficiency of the local well for the people of Benha, Egypt, in 2022. A filtration system was also installed and the pipes were extended to make the water available in taps. The parent company has also committed to investing 100 million Swiss Francs by 2030 to reduce the carbon footprint of the logistics of its three international water brands, S. Pellegrino, Acqua Panna, and Perrier.Aquafina is another purified water bottle brand, owned by PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). It sells in multiple countries including Canada, America, Spain, Peru, and Morocco. In July 2023, the company reported an analysis of their water quality which revealed that this water exceeded the requirements set by the US EPA and the US Food and Drug Administration. As per the analysis, the residual disinfectants and byproducts of disinfectants were not detected in the water.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) owns Dasani, another popular brand of bottled water that is filtered. The company has operations in more than  200 countries. On July 4, the brand reported that a Coca-Cola plant set up in Monterrey, Mexico supplies clean drinking water through an outdoor faucet to the residents of the area free of any cost. The plant especially fulfilled the local needs for water in 2022 when Monterrey was subject to a severe drought. Thus, the company strives to achieve water security in local communities.Bottled water brands from popular multinationals Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) continue to supply clean drinking water in different parts of the world. Let's take a look at the countries with the cleanest and best tasting tap water.22 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the WorldMethodologyIn order to come up with the list of the top 22 countries with the cleanest and best tasting tap water, we acquired a list of countries with the top scores for safe and healthy drinking water from Yale University’s Environmental Protection Index (EPI). EPI measures country-wise water quality by calculating scores based on the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 persons as a result of exposure to unclean and unhealthy water in the country. Countries with high scores have the purest and least contaminated drinking water. Please note that tap water is the water available in a country from its own community water system.After shortlisting countries with the top scores, we sourced the proportion of the population with access to safely managed water from a local source including piped water, boreholes or tube wells, protected dug wells, and protected springs. This metric was sourced from UNICEF. Thus, we labeled this metric as the population with access to pure tap water since tap water comes from the aforementioned sources. It is important to note that UNICEF declares drinking water safely managed when it is from a local source in the country which is accessible, available when required, and free from any contamination. Please note that all countries with quality tap water have a higher value for the metric and hence, the metric values for the respective countries are closely placed, up to three decimal places. The data for the chosen metric is from 2022.The top 22 countries with the cleanest, best tasting tap water have been ranked in ascending order of their percentage of population with access to pure tap water, as of 2022. 22 Countries with the Cleanest, Best Tasting Tap Water in the World22.

The report is expected to show a small decrease in headline inflation.Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting are also expected to provide further insight on the path forward for monetary policy and a reading of consumer sentiment will close out the week.On the corporate side, Pepsi (PEP), Delta (DAL), and JPMorgan (JPM) will highlight the start of third quarter earnings season. Reports from Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BlackRock (BLK) are expected on Friday.Monday is a bond market holiday, meaning there will be no bids on Treasury yields, which have been at the top of investor focus over the past week. However, the US stock market will still be open.Stocks enter the week largely higher after a blowout September jobs report sent stocks roaring on Friday, negating a bond yield-driven sell-off earlier in the week. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) climbed nearly 1.6% while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) rose almost 0.5%. Both rises marked the best week in the past five for the indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.3%.A hot September jobs report has further complicated the Fed's next move.The details of the report could have positives for the Fed. On a month-over-month basis, hourly wage growth came in cooler than the expected at 0.2% for the second straight month. The yearly wage growth of 4.2% was the slowest annual pace since June 2021.Broadly though, the 334,000 nonfarm payroll additions was unavoidably hot compared to what economists had expected. And that adds upside risks to further rate hikes, according to economists, as the hot job market needs to be met with cooling inflation in order to stay on pace for a coveted ""soft landing.""""While we’re sticking with our call for rates on hold, if today’s number is followed by hot inflation data the Fed may get pulled into another hike,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note on Friday. ""And if that happens the already-tenuous case for avoiding recession next year gets harder to make.""Story continuesThe latest inflation print is expected on Thursday via the Consumer Price Index. Economists forecast prices rose 3.6% over the prior year in September, a decrease from headline inflation of 3.7% in August. Prices are set to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, down from a 0.6% in August.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, CPI is expected to have risen 4.1% over last year in September, a slowdown from the 4.3% increase seen in August. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, equal from the monthly increase seen in August.""We think there is a greater risk of core CPI printing at 0.3% m/m than 0.1% m/m,"" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""Airfares and lodging could come in firmer than we expect, which would push up the m/m print to 0.3%, all else equal ... Should the print come in as we expect or above our expectations, it would keep a November hike in play.""Bets on the Fed hiking interest rates at the November meeting increased after the September jobs reports release. As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 27% chance of a rate hike in November, up from 18% a week prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023, in Washington. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Third quarter earnings season begins this week, with specific focus on what some of the nation's largest financial institutions have to say about the state of the consumer and the overall health of the US economy.Wall Street is expecting the financials sector to report year-over-year earnings growth of 8.7%, the fourth-highest growth rate out of all 11 sectors, per FactSet. Strategists believe bank stocks could provide key insight into how corporate America is dealing with the higher interest rate environment.""[Bank stocks] need to participate in any recovery rally in order to validate the notion that higher interest rates do not doom the US economy to a recession next year. If you are very bullish here, this is the group for you,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.Pepsi and Delta will provide a look at consumer demand. Pepsi will be one of the first consumer brands to report since reports about weight loss drugs bringing down demand for snacks sank stocks in the sector last week.Leading into Friday's jobs report, bond yields rose to 16-year highs. The rising yields unsettled investors already fearful of the impact of further rate hikes and sent stocks lower. But the bond-induced sell-off might not have been all bad.For one, it could keep the Fed on pause in November as some economists and Fed officials believe the rise in bonds might've already done the credit-tightening work for the central bank.""Were it not for the significant tightening in financial conditions (more than two 25bp hikes in fed funds equivalent), this report might support the additional hike foreseen in the Fed's September projections,"" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note on Friday.And while the tightening itself could still be a concern for investors, it might have opened up markets for a new catalyst.Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel says the past week's ""bondfire of the volatilities"" provided a buying opportunity for stocks.""As much focus as there is on Yields right now, earnings season begins in a week and the flip side of unanticipated 3Q economic strength is that 3Q earnings will likely surprise to the upside,"" Emanuel wrote in a note on Friday.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the oncology industry, head directly to 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.The global oncology landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to discover, develop, and provide innovative treatments aimed at improving outcomes for a growing number of patients. However, the accessibility and utilization of these new cancer medications vary significantly worldwide. According to IQVIA, the number of oncology clinical trials initiated in 2022 remained high, marking a 22% increase since 2018. Over the past five years, there has been a consistent annual rise of 5% in the global population of patients receiving cancer treatment. Projections indicate that global spending on cancer drugs is set to reach $375 billion by 2027, a significant increase from $196 billion in 2022. The oncology portfolio is expanding rapidly, with more than 2,000 products currently in development. A substantial portion of these products, nearly 71%, is being developed by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. These companies have significantly increased their contributions to the development of cancer therapies, up from 51% in 2017. Globally, 237 new active substances have been introduced for cancer treatment over the past two decades, with almost 115 launched within the last five years. The United States has seen 78 NAS launches in the past five years and a total of 189 over the last two decades.The steady rise in cancer treatment can be attributed to aging populations and improved access to healthcare services in developed markets. In lower-income markets, efforts to expand healthcare access and longer treatment durations have led to a higher number of patients receiving cancer treatment each year.As per Fortune Business Insights’ findings, the global market for oncology drugs reached a value of $184.95 billion in 2022. Projections indicate significant growth, with the market expected to increase from $205.52 billion in 2023 to an estimated $484.32 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% during the forecast period. Oncology drugs include a wide range of treatments, including targeted therapies, chemotherapy agents, immunotherapies, and hormone therapies, all developed to combat cancer. Several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including the increasing prevalence of different types of cancer, the approval and launch of new drugs, and improved research efforts by pharmaceutical companies in the oncology field. For instance, as per data released by the American Cancer Society in January, 2023 will see a rise in cancer patients in the United States, with an anticipated 28% increase compared to 2010, resulting in approximately 1.96 million cancer cases by the end of 2023.Story continuesFaced with a severe shortage of over a dozen cancer medications, the US Food and Drug Administration is considering the temporary importation of chemotherapy drugs from international manufacturers not currently approved for distribution in the United States, an FDA spokesperson told CNBC. This potential move aims to address a pressing issue highlighted by medical professionals at hospitals across the country, particularly concerning two drugs – cisplatin and carboplatin, which play a critical role in cancer treatment and are widely utilized. The World Health Organization has recognized the significance of these drugs in basic healthcare. Shortages of these drugs have compelled hospitals to ration their supply by reducing doses and prioritizing patients who stand to gain the most from treatment. Dr. Abdul Rafeh Naqash, a doctor at the Stephenson Cancer Center at the University of Oklahoma, stated:“The lawmakers in the country need to understand that this is a big problem at this point, where unless something changes in the next few weeks, this can lead to a big national emergency from a patient and health care standpoint.”The shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are the result of a temporary production halt for the U.S. market at an Intas Pharmaceuticals facility in India. Dr. Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society, pointed out that these shortages highlight a persistent economic issue in the generic drug market. She also noted that the demand for these drugs is expected to increase in the coming years due to an aging population, as older individuals face a higher risk of cancer.In this article, we discuss some of the top cancer stocks to invest in, which include Pfizer Inc.

We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”10.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”8.

Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”6. Amgen Inc.

Similar to many of its large cap pharma/biotech peers, Amgen is facing patent cliffs for its major drugs in the second half of the decade, while the company’s pipeline has disappointed. In addition, Amgen is facing above-average pricing pressure impacting a number of its current products that compete in crowded therapeutic areas. Amgen is now relying more heavily on acquisitions to address its patent cliff and weak internal pipeline. However, Amgen’s recently proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics is being challenged by the FTC, creating further uncertainty.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds10 Best Small-Cap Casino Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets According to Hedge Funds Disclosure: None. 14 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
