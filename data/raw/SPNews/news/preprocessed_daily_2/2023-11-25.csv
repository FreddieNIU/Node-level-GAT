Sales for Calvin Klein are anticipated to increase 3.2% year over year, while Heritage Brands is expected to deliver a sales decline of 2.4%.The continued momentum in PVH Corp's international unit is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fiscal third quarter.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Although, when we looked at PVH (NYSE:PVH), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for PVH, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.099 = US$830m ÷ (US$12b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).', ""So, PVH has an ROCE of 9.9%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Luxury industry average of 13%."", ' View our latest analysis for PVH ', ""In the above chart we have measured PVH's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PVH."", ""There hasn't been much to report for PVH's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect PVH to be a multi-bagger going forward."", ""On another note, while the change in ROCE trend might not scream for attention, it's interesting that the current liabilities have actually gone up over the last five years. This is intriguing because if current liabilities hadn't increased to 27% of total assets, this reported ROCE would probably be less than9.9% because total capital employed would be higher.The 9.9% ROCE could be even lower if current liabilities weren't 27% of total assets, because the the formula would show a larger base of total capital employed. With that in mind, just be wary if this ratio increases in the future, because if it gets particularly high, this brings with it some new elements of risk."", ""In a nutshell, PVH has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 21% in the last five years. Therefore based on the analysis done in this article, we don't think PVH has the makings of a multi-bagger."", ""PVH does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for PVH  that you might be interested in."", ""While PVH may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The state-owned oil major has plans to transform Brazil’s global energy presence, which includes boosting its oil output, solidifying new European partnerships and plans to develop new projects.', 'Brazil was the ninth-largest oil-producing country in the world last year, with an average output of 3 million bpd, growing by 4 percent from 2021. The Brasília government aims to increase this position to fourth in the world by 2030 by producing around 5.4 million bpd, and Petrobras is taking the lead in the industry. Joelson Falcão Mendes, the director of exploration and production at Petrobras,\xa0stated\xa0“This year we will exceed our goals [and] surpass what we predicted.” Mendes added, “We have significant and growing production for the coming years.” Petrobras recently\xa0increased its end-of-year production forecast to 2.2 million bpd, compared to 2.1 million bpd previously. This was mainly due to record subsalt production in recent months, as well as the acceleration of production across its vessels and the connection of new wells.', 'Much of Brazil’s oil comes from its ‘pre-salt’ region, where 11.5 billion barrels of proven crude deposits sit under a thick crust of sodium chloride, beneath the ocean floor. These deposits lie around 200km from Rio de Janeiro and were discovered during da Silva’s first term in office in 2006. Petrobras now plans to develop 11 more platforms in the waters by 2027. However, output from the region is expected to peak by 2029, meaning many are questioning the long-term potential for oil production in Brazil.', 'Environmentalists worry that Petrobras’s ambitions are at odds with leftist leader da Silva’s aim for ecological protection and sustainable development. Mendes has made it clear that fossil fuels will remain part of Brazil’s energy mix, seen as vital for bringing in revenues. However, Petrobras has also pledged to spend more heavily on green energy projects, pumping its oil funds into cleaner alternatives. Yet, many worry that with demand expected to wane over the coming decade, it would be wise for Brazil to shift its attention away from fossil fuel to renewable alternatives sooner rather than later.', 'When da Silva came into office in January, he\xa0pledged\xa0to increase environmental protections, fight deforestation, and protect those who defend the environment, a dramatic turnaround from his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro. During his first six months in office, deforestation dropped by 33.6 percent, according to government satellite data. João Paulo Capobianco, the environment ministry’s executive secretary,\xa0stated\xa0of the achievement, “The effort of reversing the curve of growth has been reached. That is a fact: we reversed the curve; deforestation isn’t increasing.”', ""However, Petrobras now wants to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River as part of its plan to boost its production levels. Brazil's environment protection agency Ibama is expected to decide whether this project can go ahead in early 2024. Brazil's Equatorial Margin is thought to be one of the country’s most promising regions for oil and gas exploration, but it also has great ecological value because of its biodiversity and proximity to the Amazon rainforest. Petrobras has already\xa0appealed\xa0an earlier decision by Ibama prohibiting the drilling of an exploratory well in the area."", 'In addition to its oil and gas ambitions, Petrobras has also been moving ahead in its plans to develop Brazil’s green resources. This month, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Danish company European Energy to explore the potential for developing an e-methanol plant in Brazil. E-methanol is a low-carbon fuel produced by combining green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. It can be used to fuel industrial activities in hard-to-abate industries, making it highly attractive in the shift away from oil and gas.', 'Jean Paul Prates, the President of Petrobras,\xa0stated, “Petrobras wants to focus on having good partners like European Energy… This partnership will benefit both sides. We can provide our knowledge and help to bring both the companies and our countries closer together.”', 'This move follows several agreements with renewable energy companies in recent months as Petrobras attempts to make good on its pledge for financial divestment beyond fossil fuels. In September, Petrobras signed an MoU with TotalEnergies and Casa dos Ventos Holding to assess perspectives and joint opportunities in renewable energy and low-carbon hydrogen in Brazil. Patrick Pouyanné, the CEO of TotalEnergies\xa0stated, “Brazil is a great country for developing renewable energies. We are therefore delighted to join forces with Casa dos Ventos and Petrobras to identify potential synergies between our activities, and thus develop profitable renewables opportunities.”', 'Petrobras has high hopes for Brazil’s oil industry, which depend largely on whether the government allows for further drilling to go ahead, potentially at the cost of its pledge for ecological preservation. However, its recent deals with various international energy companies suggest that the oil major has great potential to break into the world of renewables, using its oil revenues and experience to develop Brazil’s green resources and future-proof its operations.', 'By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'JP Morgan Expects Brent Crude to Average $83 in 2024', 'European Natural Gas Prices Seesaw as Cold Snap Arrives', 'Top Semiconductor Companies Control 98% of Global Market', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Verzenio, Trulicity, Taltz and others.Sales of its weight-loss drug, Mounjaro, are already benefiting from strong demand trends. Mounjaro is expected to be a key long-term top-line driver for Lilly as it has the potential to be approved for obesity and other diabetes-related diseases. Mounjaro showed superior weight-loss reduction in clinical studies for obesity.\xa0 Lilly expects regulatory decisions for some key pipeline candidates this year.However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined slightly ahead of Q3 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Shares of Accenture have gained +14.2% over the past year against the Zacks Consulting Services industry’s gain of +15.8%. The company has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs.Accenture has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships. The company’s strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential. Partly due to these tailwinds,On the flip side, pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, remains a concern.

The recovery of the HomeGoods (U.S.) division bodes well.However, TJX has been grappling with high wage and supply-chain costs. It expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024.

GGG is gaining from strength in the Industrial and Process segments. Improved project activity in the Asia Pacific region is aiding the Industrial segment. Solid momentum in most business units and across all reportable regions, led by double-digit growth in vehicle services and semiconductors, is driving the Process segment.Also, the company’s diversified business structure, with exposure to various end markets like general industrial, automotive, alternative energy, pharma, food & beverage, vehicle services, oil & natural gas, environmental & transportation, infrastructure and others, helps offset weaknesses associated with a single market. For 2023, GGG predicts organic sales growth (on a constant-currency basis) to be in the low-single digits.Strong price realization, along with favorable product and channel mix, is driving Graco’s margin performance. Graco’s gross margin increased 490 basis points in the third quarter of 2023.Investments in capacity expansion and product innovation are aiding Graco’s performance. In 2023, the company anticipates capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million, including $130 million for facility expansion projects at its Minnesota, South Dakota, Switzerland and Romania facilities. As for innovation, GGG introduced a hot melt adhesive dispense system, the InvisiPac HM10 and electric-powered airless gun and Ultra QuickShotearlier in 2023.The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first nine months of 2023, Graco paid out dividends worth $118.7 million to its shareholders, up 11.1% year over year. It repurchased common stocks worth $27.1 million in the same period. GGG hiked its quarterly dividend by 11.9% to 23.5 cents per share in December 2022.However, weakness in the Contractor segment, arising from reduced demand from slower economic activity in worldwide construction markets, raises concerns for GGG. Also, lower demand in the shipping container business and construction markets is adversely affecting sales in the segment’s Asia Pacific region.', 'Escalating costs and expenses have been a concern for GGG over time. In the first nine months of 2023, Graco’s selling, marketing and distribution costs increased 4.2% from the year-ago period. General and administrative expenses jumped 8.3% year over year in the same period.

If you want to skip our introduction to the billionaire hedge fund investor and the latest stock market news, then take a look at Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Long-Term Stock Picks: Top 5 Stocks. "", ""Leon Cooperman is one of the most seasoned hands on Wall Street. Mr. Cooperman graduated from the Columbia Business School in 1967. Immediately after graduating, he would work for the famed Goldman Sachs investment bank and spend 22 years there and go on to head Goldman's lucrative Asset Management business division."", ""Leon Cooperman set up his hedge fund Omega Advisors in 1991. He would spend the next 17 years of his life managing capital for outside investors and then retire and convert the fund into a family office. Mr. Cooperman's time in the industry has yielded handsome dividends, making him one of the richest people in the world with a net worth that is currently estimated to sit at $2.8 billion according to Forbes Magazine."", ""Shifting gears to focus on his fund, Omega Advisors had a portfolio worth $1.9 billion as of Q3 2023 end. This marked a small $67 million increase over the past quarter, and on an annual basis, the portfolio has grown by roughly $500 million. His investment approach is quite a popular one on Wall Street and has been followed by seasoned financial bosses such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. If you haven't guessed it by now, Leon Cooperman is another hedge fund billionaire who has relied on a time tested approach of value investing. Value investing, for those out of the loop, involves picking out the right stocks and then patiently waiting for their value to appreciate over a long time period. The key to successful value investing is to determine the fair value of a stock, often based on its ability to generate future cash flows that will be available to investors. Then, a margin of safety is determined, which measures the current share price against the fair value price to measure the potential of losses in case the bet goes haywire. Like Buffett and Klarman, Mr. Cooperman's hedge fund has also outperformed the S&P 500 through careful stock selection by delivering 12.5% in annual returns between 1991 and 2018."", ""On the personal front, Mr. Cooperman actually planned to become a dentist before switching careers. He also had 16 job offers laid out for him in 1966 - something that most fresh graduates would be envious of these days. Additionally, Cooperman actually turned down Goldman Sachs the first time around despite being offered a job. He would later go on and accept a position after the possibilities of compensation growth became clear. Value investing also sits at the heart of his strategies, with the investment guru unable to see the point of paying high multiples for firms, especially during today's fast paced product cycles."", ""Safe to say, Leon Cooperman has had a remarkable and memorable time on the stock market through a career that has allowed him to beat markets when most people were making losses. Naturally, it pays to listen to him, and when it comes to the future, Mr. Cooperman shared his thoughts during CNBC's Financial Advisor Summit in October 2023 when he outlined:"", 'Yeah, I’m not making a seven year forecast. I’m not making a 10 year forecast. But what I’m saying is, you know, I don’t think the markets got much upside in the near term. Things change. You know, we have a lot to worry about. What happened in Middle East is a concern. It’s despicable what the Hamas did. And it’s hard not to imagine a strong response by Israel and that can become broader in nature. So you know, you gotta be very careful. You know, it’s not an easy call. And I think people on your program are not spending enough time talking about our fiscal situation. They’re all focused on inflation. But I think inflation is just one part of the issue. I think that focusing on our fiscal deficit would make a lot of sense. And I don’t know how we cure it. I really don’t. The numbers are so large. I’ve advocated for several years on your program, that as a nation, we have to coalesce around the question, what should the maximum tax rate be on wealthy people? Because that will define the revenue yield to the government and the government has to size themselves to that revenue yield.', ""So, as Mr. Cooperman remains cautionary about the market's upside, it pays to see which stocks he's refusing to sell. We took a look today, and some notable names are The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)."", 'Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Leon Cooperman's long term stock picks, we sifted through Omega Advisors' Q3 2023 SEC filings and picked out the stocks in which the firm has invested for the longest time periods."", ""Omega Advisor's Q3 2023 Investment Value: $78.4 million "", 'First Purchase: 2016 ', ""Ashland Inc.

With regards to trust, with regards to, you know, their corporate governance structure. Like I said, for the past year, it's been about a year since ChatGPT come out. OpenAI has been riding high, and Sam Altman has really been kind of the epitome. I mean, he's a brilliant mind for, you know, the incredible advances that are now happening in AI research."", 'Since the breakthroughs that have been pioneered by OpenAI, but also other kind of AI frontier research companies have really come to the fore over the past 12 months. I mean, there has been a lot of intracompetition between some of the companies, not only the big tech companies, but some of the other frontier AI companies.', ""So I think that the incidence or what's happened over the last week with OpenAI will certainly serve them well. You know, other competitors like Anthropic, like Google who isn't partnered with OpenAI, you know, they will be looking to kind of move into that space, that kind of mythical space that OpenAI had occupied. So I think that, you know, it hurts our brand. But will they continue to do incredible developments in AI research? Yes, absolutely. But it's a hotly contested space and others will be stepping up too."", ""SEANA SMITH: Nina, you mentioned, going back to what you just said a minute ago, about commercializing generative AI. How does OpenAI, or I guess, what does that strategy, what does that approach look like when you're talking about commercializing generative AI ChatGPT more effectively?"", 'NINA SCHICK: So I mean, for OpenAI, in particular, this has always been slightly a quandary, right? Because they were founded in 2015 with the mission to protect AGI or super-- to develop AGI or superintelligence for the benefit of humanity. And what ended up happening last year was that they released an incredibly sophisticated large language model, ChatGPT, which for the first time really started to show us the beginnings of the so-called intelligence revolution.', ""The capacity for AI systems to be able to augment and plug into human intelligent and creative processes, right? So for ChatGPT alone for the past year, I've been speaking to multiple businesses who are thinking about how can we deploy a large language model like this within our organization for efficiency, for cost cutting, and actually can we use something like this also to generate revenue? Can it help us come up with new strategy, with new ideas, with new predictive analysis?"", ""And that's what we've been seeing over the past year, not only with OpenAI and its ChatGPT product, but really the development of large language models across kind of the spectrum of big tech and frontier AI companies. So it's also worth remembering that large language models are the rage today, but they're only one kind of generative model, right?"", ""These capabilities are going to continue to increase, not least because the incredible amount of talent flowing into the space, as well as the money and the fact that pretty much all of big tech have become AI-first companies. So I think we will continue to see these capabilities being developed at an exponential rate, as well as the adoption curve being higher than any kind of general technologies we've seen in the past. I think it'll be bigger than the internet."", ""So when it comes to the world of work and where the applications will be, that's really like asking how long is a piece of string. Because when you think of AI, it's more a meta technology than a technology itself. It's the technology that's going to enable platforms it's going to enable applications, it's going to enable tools and products. So that's really what I see happening in the next few years with AI.""]"

Co-Founder Bill Gates is celebrated for his monumental role in the tech world and is known as one of the planet's wealthiest people."", 'Yet, an intriguing “what-if” scenario arises: Had he “diamond-handed” his Microsoft shares — a term in finance meaning to hold onto assets through market ups and downs — his wealth might have soared to unmatched levels. A resurfaced article from 2021 amplifies this speculation: What if Gates had kept his initial Microsoft stakes? Could he have outpaced today’s wealthiest, like Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk and Amazon.com Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos, to become a trillionaire?', 'The narrative begins with Microsoft’s initial public offering (IPO) in 1986. At that time, Gates held a 49% stake in the company. After the IPO, this reduced slightly to 45%. Fast forward to the present, and Microsoft’s market capitalization stands at approximately $2.805 trillion. Had Gates maintained his 45% stake, it would equate to $1.23 trillion today — a figure that dwarfs the net worths of Musk and Bezos.', 'Don’t Miss:', ""The VC firm that backed Apple before its IPO in 1980 is focusing on AI — Here's how you can do the same with $1,000."", 'Support Travis Kelce and PlayersTV Digital in empowering athletes through media. Your investment fuels the rise of athlete-owned content.', 'Microsoft’s journey to becoming a trillion-dollar empire is a testament to its resilience and innovation in the tech industry. Gates’s vision and leadership during the formative years were instrumental in this ascent. By 1999, Microsoft had crossed a $500 billion valuation, with Gates still owning about 20% of the company. If he had preserved these shares, they would be valued at over $500 billion today.', 'However, Gates’s approach to wealth has been markedly different. Today, he holds a 1.38% stake in Microsoft, amounting to 103 million shares. This significant reduction from his initial post-IPO stake indicates a strategic shift in his investment philosophy. Over time, Gates has diversified his portfolio, moving away from a Microsoft-centric wealth concentration. As of November, his net worth is estimated at $116 billion. A substantial part of this comes from his shares in Microsoft, both directly and indirectly, with about 20.28% of his public holdings in Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a conglomerate led by his close friend and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett.', 'Trending: Get equity and front row seats to the startups and small businesses you love —\u2060 for as little as $100.', 'Gates’s wealth, even though diminished from its potential trillion-dollar height, remains colossal. In 1999, his fortune was almost three times that of Buffett, who was the second-richest person at the time. That year, Gates’s wealth surged past the $100 billion mark, a milestone that Buffett reached much later, with a valuation of about $36 billion in 1999.', 'Gates’s decision to diversify his investments and reduce his stake in Microsoft over the years reflects a broader trend among the ultra-wealthy to mitigate risk and explore other opportunities. While this strategy may have cost him the title of the world’s first trillionaire, it demonstrates a more balanced approach to wealth management. This decision also paved the way for his extensive philanthropic endeavors, further cementing his legacy not just as a tech mogul but as a global humanitarian.', 'Reflecting on the potential of what might have been, it’s evident that Gates’s impact on the world extends beyond the confines of Microsoft and the hypotheticals of his net worth. His evolution from a tech visionary to a diversified investor and philanthropist remains a testament to the multifaceted nature of his influence.', ""Gates has not only shaped the technology industry but also made significant strides in global health and education through his philanthropy.

After all, a CBS News report earlier this year mentioned that the pessimism is finally over. And at the time, surveyed investors saw better days ahead. Well, that narrative has changed.', 'In late September, investors were far more cynical about any upswings, noting that they could effectively be a dead-cat bounce. Further, many feared that a recession would be on tap for next year. So, should investors at least consider safe stocks for a bear market? It’s starting to look that way.', 'Perhaps most noticeably, shares of big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) plunged following its earnings disclosure. Management issued a pensive note about consumer sentiment ahead of the holidays. Since companies like Walmart represent the real economy’s pulse, that’s not a great sign for growth speculators.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, if you’re interested in staying in the market, it may be time to think safety first. Below are safe stocks for a bear market.', 'Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com', 'Given the troubles that Walmart just incurred, it’s understandable to be a little bit shaky about Costco (NASDAQ:COST). On a broader level, the two share a similar business model: sell at large scale and attract customers with the underlying discount. However, the two are very different when it comes to average shopper income.', 'I’m not going to get into the demographic granularity. If you’re interested, that research is freely available. However, what I will mention is that Costco members – because it’s a membership-only club – tends to attract a younger, more upwardly mobile and wealthier core consumer base than Walmart shoppers. On an anecdotal level, you can look at the parking lot of a Costco and do the same exercise for Walmart.', 'The difference is quite stark, if you catch my drift. If you don’t, the reality is that while both Costco and Walmart enjoy consistent profitability, the former prints a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 13.2%. For Walmart, this metric is a decent 7% but clearly lacks Costco’s firepower. So, COST is one of the safe stocks for a bear market.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'To be honest, almost any relevant utility firm that’s not a complete mess up would fit into the category of safe stocks for a bear market. For this round, I’m going to go with Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Having never visited the eastern side of the U.S. – aside from transiting at JFK – I’m not personally familiar with Duke. That said, the main long-term benefit of the company is geographical leverage.', 'Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke provides electric power and natural gas services to its southern neighbor. In addition, the company’s website states that it provides various services to Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Due to cost-of-living concerns, millennials have been flocking to smaller Midwestern cities along with the Carolinas even before the pandemic. In the post-pandemic inflationary paradigm, this incentive has surely accelerated.', 'Cynically, that’s great news for Duke. And no matter what, people must pay their bills. So, it doesn’t really matter that Duke’s financials are less than sterling. It’s consistently profitable thanks to its captive audience. Because of that factor, it’s one of the safe stocks to own.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) benefits from exceptional, even permanent relevance. I don’t care how advanced society becomes; we’ll always need to eat and that keeps the lights on at Archer Daniels Midland. However, Wall Street doesn’t think too much about ADM, with shares down almost 18% since the January opener.', 'Under this context, yes, it’s one of the riskier ideas among “safe stocks,” admittedly. It’s also possible that whatever funk that ADM is going through will dissipate soon enough. Fundamentally, I make that argument because, per Walmart’s warnings, consumers may be shifting away from discretionary purchases. That makes sense. But you can’t shift away from eating – that’s a no go.', 'Also, it’s quite possible that ADM – thanks to its market losses – has been de-risked. For example, it trades at only 10.3x trailing earnings and only 11x forward earnings. On a final note, Archer Daniels Midland also offers a forward yield of 2.44%.

HST have gained 12.6% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.The Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. The recovery in demand for the company’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers has benefited the company lately.Earlier this month, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of 41 cents, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. The figure increased 7.9% year over year.Host Hotels also raised its full-year AFFO per share guidance to the range of $1.90-$1.95 from $1.82-$1.89 projected earlier. This suggests a 6-cent increase at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.81.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Let us discuss the factors that supported the uptick and check whether the trend will last.Host Hotels has a strong Sunbelt exposure and presence in the top 20 U.S. markets. Its properties are advantageously located in central business districts of major cities with close proximity to airports and resort/conference destinations. This is likely to drive the demand for the company’s properties in the upcoming period. \xa0The improvement in group travel demand and business transient travel demand, led by small and medium-sized businesses, have aided occupancy and hotel revenue per available (RevPAR) growth lately.Notably, in the third quarter, the company reported comparable hotel RevPAR of $201.32, which climbed 1.8% from the year-ago quarter’s $197.76 and 4.4% from the third-quarter 2019 tally of $192.81. The comparable average occupancy percentage was 71.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior-year quarter.Over the years, HST has made concerted efforts to dispose of non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements through its capital-recycling program. It has redeployed the proceeds to acquire or invest in premium properties in markets that are expected to recover faster.Moreover, it has broadened its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 in search of higher portfolio EBITDA and revenues. Per the company’s November 2023 Investor Presentation, from 2021 through the end of the third quarter of 2023, total dispositions amounted to $1.5 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple. Its acquisitions during this period amounted to $1.9 billion, which is 13.1 times the EBITDA multiple.Such efforts highlight its prudent capital-management practices and preserve balance sheet strength.HST’s solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity has enabled it to capitalize on growth opportunities and has facilitated redevelopment activities. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $2.6 billion in total available liquidity. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among the lodging REITs, having ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&P Global. This renders access to the debt market at favorable costs.Hence, with no material debt maturities until April 2024 and enough financial flexibility, HST is well-positioned to carry on with its growth endeavors. \xa0The company’s current cash flow growth is projected at 71.75% compared with the 8.10% expected for the industry. Also, a trailing 12-month return on equity of 11.01% compared with the industry’s average of 3.10% reflects HST’s superiority in terms of utilizing shareholders’ funds over its peers.Solid dividend payouts are a massive enticement for REIT investors, and Host Hotels has remained committed to that. In September 2023, the company rewarded its shareholders with a 20% sequential hike in its third-quarter 2023 cash dividend payment to 18 cents per share from 15 cents paid out earlier. Notably, HST has increased its dividend seven times in the last five years. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock. Check out Host Hotels & Resorts’ dividend history here.With rebounding operating trends, a lower dividend payout ratio compared with the industry and a solid financial position, we expect the latest dividend hike to be sustainable over the long run.Nonetheless, Host Hotels faces stiff competition from other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs, which may weigh on its prospects.The prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to affect the company’s ability to maintain rates in its resort markets and keep up the momentum in the improvement in group, business transient and international inbound travel. A high interest rate environment adds to its concerns.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EastGroup Properties’ 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally upward in the past month to $7.69.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stag Industrial’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 1.3% upward over the past month to $2.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Park Hotels & Resorts’ current-year FFO per share has moved 3.1% northward over the past month to $1.98.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Gradually, the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management.

A number of factors, including geopolitical tensions, global supply-chain disruptions, aggressive monetary policy tightening worldwide to control inflation and potential economic slowdown/recession, continue to act as headwinds for global M&As. These factors also hampered debt and equity issuance volumes.With inflation seeming to be cooling down gradually and the market participants now expecting a “soft landing” of the U.S. economy, green shoots in advisory and underwriting businesses are visible as the deal pipeline looks healthy. But the macroeconomic and geopolitical ambiguity remains a major concern, and till this is over, it will be a bumpy ride for investment banks. Hence, soft underwriting and advisory businesses are expected to keep hurting industry players’ revenue growth.Trading Business Offers Some Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since 2022, market volatility has significantly increased due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. The current situation will likely persist this year as markets are still grappling with high global inflation, high-interest rate regimes and other geopolitical matters. So, trading volumes will likely remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting industry players’ trading income.Technology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to support the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to help clients with infrastructure development and new platforms.

This sale has caught the attention of investors and analysts, as insider transactions can provide valuable insights into a company's prospects and the sentiment of its executives.Who is Essex Mitchell of Hologic Inc?Essex Mitchell serves as the Division President, GYN Surgical at Hologic Inc. In this role, Mitchell is responsible for overseeing the strategic direction and operational execution of the company's GYN Surgical division. Mitchell's insider transactions are closely watched as they may reflect the insider's belief in the company's future performance and strategic direction.Hologic Inc's Business DescriptionHologic Inc is a leading developer, manufacturer, and supplier of premium diagnostic products, medical imaging systems, and surgical products with an emphasis on women's health. The company's core business units focus on diagnostics, breast health, GYN surgical, and skeletal health. Hologic's innovative technologies are designed to enable earlier detection, more effective treatment, and better outcomes in the healthcare sector, particularly in addressing conditions affecting women.Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and the Relationship with the Stock PriceThe recent sale by Essex Mitchell of 7,500 shares is part of a larger pattern observed over the past year. According to the data, Mitchell has sold a total of 9,890 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided transaction history could suggest that the insider may perceive the stock's current valuation as being on the higher side, prompting a decision to realize gains.The insider transaction history for Hologic Inc shows a lack of insider buying over the past year, with 0 insider buys recorded. On the other hand, there have been 6 insider sells in the same timeframe. This trend of insider selling could be interpreted as a signal that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company see limited upside potential or consider the stock to be fully valued at current levels."", ""When examining the relationship between insider selling and the stock price, it's important to consider the context of the market and the company's performance. Insider selling does not always indicate a lack of confidence in the company; it can also be motivated by personal financial planning or diversification needs. However, consistent selling by insiders, particularly without any offsetting insider buying, can be a red flag for investors.Valuation and Market ReactionOn the day of Mitchell's recent sale, shares of Hologic Inc were trading at $71.85, giving the company a market cap of $17.572 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 39.44 is higher than both the industry median of 30.71 and the company's historical median, suggesting that the stock may be trading at a premium compared to its peers and its own historical valuation.With a price of $71.85 and a GuruFocus Value of $61.30, Hologic Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.17, indicating that the stock is modestly overvalued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, taking into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. The current price-to-GF-Value ratio above 1 suggests that the market is pricing in expectations for future growth and performance that may be optimistic.ConclusionThe recent insider sell by Essex Mitchell at Hologic Inc, along with the broader trend of insider selling and no buying over the past year, may raise questions among investors about the stock's valuation and future prospects. While the company holds a strong position in the women's health market, the current valuation metrics and the price-to-GF-Value ratio suggest that the stock may be trading at a premium. Investors should consider these insider transactions and valuation indicators alongside a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health, market position, and growth prospects before making investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(NYSE:M) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.1654 per share on the 2nd of January. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", "" View our latest analysis for Macy's "", ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. But before making this announcement, Macy's' earnings quite easily covered the dividend. The business is returning a large chunk of its cash to shareholders, which means it is not being used to grow the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 56.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 16% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.662. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 1.9% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Macy's' earnings per share has shrunk at 15% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Macy's' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. The low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, but generally we are not too happy with the payments Macy's has been making. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Macy's that investors should take into consideration.

A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity demand in the United States can drop 1.3% year over year in 2023 but increase 1.7% in 2024. The decline in demand in 2023 was primarily due to milder temperatures in the first half of the year. Despite the expected reduction in usage, utilities will continue to benefit from the rise in residential electricity rates.In order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, utilities approach capital markets for loans. Utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes have pushed up interest rates. High interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels.In this article, we run a comparative analysis on two electric supply companies — NiSource Inc.

Of course, with a P/E ratio of 56.02, the market remains optimistic.', 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Merck's TSR for the last 5 years was 57%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Investors in Merck had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.6% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 14%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   5 warning signs  we've spotted with Merck ."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Long-term stock investors have had to muddle through challenging macroeconomic headwinds in 2023. High inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures, two government shutdowns averted, and a new war that is fueling concerns about a broader conflict. ', 'Have I missed anything? Probably. 2023 has been a year many investors would like to forget. ', 'It’s times like these when you hear the tongue-in-cheek remarks about 401(k)’s becoming 201(k)’s. But seeing your retirement savings shrink is no laughing matter. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s where high-yield blue-chip stocks come in. These stocks are known for their defensive characteristics. They won’t outperform growth stocks when the bulls are pushing the market higher. On the other hand, they tend to perform less badly when the market is in a correction. They won’t be the names that get bragged about on the golf course. But you’ll be glad you own them when it’s time to play pickle ball. ', 'And the real benefit to these stocks is that they pay a dividend which increases your total return. Over time, a strong total return is the key to building wealth. Here are seven high-yield blue-chip stocks to help you meet your retirement goals no matter where you are on your investment journey. ', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is first on this list of high-yield blue-chip stocks that make sense in any retirement portfolio. Biopharmaceutical stocks are consistently affected by short-term news. In the case of AbbVie, the stock is down about 14% in 2023 over concerns of a patent cliff for its flagship drug, Humira.', 'A patent cliff occurs when a drug, like Humira, is subject to competition from generic (and lower cost) brands. However, the impact of that competition is not taking as big of a bite out of Humira sales as feared. Plus, the company is getting strong performance from two new drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. ', 'The message for long-term investors is that with a company like AbbVie, it’s about the pipeline. AbbVie has a deep one that should continue to reward investors for years. ', 'The five-year total return on ABBV stock is 92.81%. That means $1,000 invested in 2018 would be worth 1,920,81. Part of that total return comes from the company’s dividend which currently yields 4.3% and has a $5.92 annual payout per share, for now. AbbVie is a Dividend King which means it’s increased its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. ', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been a tough stock for long-term investors in the last five years. The total return on JNJ stock has been just 17.7%. At a little over 3% a year, that hasn’t been keeping up with inflation.', 'There are reasons for that. The company has been trying to reach a settlement in its talc lawsuit. But even when it does, investors will wait to see the effect on the company’s bottom line. ', 'The company also completed a spinoff of its consumer health brands division that will allow it to focus on its core business. The new company, Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), went public earlier this year.', 'Sure, JNJ stock hasn’t done much price wise in the last five years. But with the lawsuit issue mostly behind it and the company becoming more streamlined, it’s not hard to imagine the stock will perform much better in the next five years. That will give long-term investors a reason beyond the dividend to be glad they own the stock. ', 'Source: jadimages / Shutterstock.com', 'When you think about high-yield blue-chip stocks, utility companies often come to mind. These are names your grandparents held in their retirement accounts. And Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a top name to consider. But there are reasons to believe that Duke isn’t your grandfather’s utility stock – at least not completely.', 'Duke owns 50,000 megawatts of power in six states including Florida. The number of people who are moving or have already moved to the Sunshine State gives you an idea of the customer base that the utility will have in coming years.', 'The total return for DUK stock in the last five years is 26.3%. And when you consider that Duke’s dividend yield is 4.63%, you know that is where investors are getting most of their growth. Still, at a time when many companies are warning of a profit recession, Duke projects 5% to 7% EPS growth through 2027 that will put a floor on DUK stock.

That brings us to the Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). The midstream company is one of the leading distributors of natural gas in the country. The company’s operations span 30,000 miles in 25 states. ', 'And that’s just in the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, CEO Alan Armstrong, said the company is well positioned to handle the expected surge in natural gas demand in coming years whether in the U.S. or abroad.', 'Williams Companies has a five-year total return of 93.37%. That’s a 930.37 increase to a $1,000 investment. And there’s reason to believe that kind of performance is sustainable. Williams has paid a quarterly dividend for more than 50 years. That dividend currently yields 5.14%. This is a stock that’s about as steady as it gets. The company has a forward P/E of just 17x earnings. ', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Another area where you can look for defensive stocks is in consumer staples. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) may not fit the classic definition of a staples stock. But don’t tell that to shareholders. The company continues to deliver quarter after quarter. ', 'The main takeaway for investors is the company’s pricing power. As inflation has run hot, Pepsi has shown the ability to pass along at least a portion of its costs. That’s supported earnings growth which Pepsi is happy to return to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. ', 'You can flip a coin and land on Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) here. Or heck, just own both. But if you have to pick just one, PEP stock looks like a better choice in terms of total return. You’re getting high single-digit stock price growth over the last five years and a dividend with a yield of 3.03% and a payout of $5.06 per share annually. That works out to a 65% total return in the last five years. ', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a conservative play among semiconductor stocks. The company won’t make investors forget about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In fact, the company’s products aren’t widely adopted in the artificial intelligence space.', 'But the company’s semiconductor chips are used in a range of applications, including AI, that gives the company a broad customer base and one of the healthiest operating margins in the sector. Arguably that hasn’t done much for investors in 2023. The company’s revenue and earnings are both down year-over-year. Not surprisingly, so is TXN stock which is down over 8% in 2024.', 'But this is about long-term growth, and that’s where the company shines. In the past', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to high-yield blue-chip stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) come to mind. These companies pay regular, in many cases monthly, dividends. And because of their structure they are required to return at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. ', 'As its name implies, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a REIT that owns, acquires, develops and operates self-storage facilities in the United States and Europe. As of October 2023, the company had properties in 40 states. PSA stock has had a total return of 61% in the last five years.', 'Public Storage is agnostic to the housing market. People need to store their stuff and Public Storage owns the facilities that help them do that. There could also be a longer-term trend here of downsizing to more affordable living spaces.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global aviation and aerospace industry in 2024, go directly and see 10 Easiest Islands To Get To In the Caribbean.', 'As per numerous accounts, the rebound of the global aviation industry post the COVID-19 pandemic was not as impressive as was initially projected, with travelers complaining of exhaustive queues, delayed flights, and lost bags owing to severe labor shortages within the entire aviation ecosystem. As of November 2023 however, the aviation industry has regained much of its lost glory, with average operational profitability of the airline sector (EBIT) expected to recover to 2.8% by the end of the year, and net profits rising north of 1.2% to $9.8 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), operating profits are expected to reach $22.4 billion by January 2024, with total revenues expected to grow 9.7% year-on-year to $803 billion as of November 2023. This is the first time that the industry will post revenues north of $800 billion since the offset of the pandemic. According to the Director General of the IATA Willie Walsh:', '“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year. Economic uncertainties have not dampened the desire to travel, even as ticket prices absorbed elevated fuel costs. After deep COVID-19 losses, even a net profit margin of 1.2% is something to celebrate! But with airlines just making $2.25 per passenger on average, repairing damaged balance sheets and providing investors with sustainable returns on their capital will continue to be a challenge for many airlines.”', 'Before the onset of the pandemic in 2019, the aviation value chain tended to generate an annual financial loss of more than $5 billion between 2012 to 2019, according to McKinsey. This was primarily due to the fact that airlines were considered to be the weakest link in the aviation value chain, consistently leaking losses of more than $18 billion annually on average. The sub-par performance of airlines was usually attributed to certain entrenched challenges like low entry barriers, high exit barriers, sensitivity to external turbulence, the fragmented outlook of the industry at large, and an incredibly concentrated supplier terrain. This complicated atmosphere led to an uneven distribution of profits across the value chain, even with respect to some of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean.\xa0 These losses only exacerbated during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, as airlines lost more than $279 billion in two years of global lockdowns and flight suspensions. However, the industry was kept afloat by the air cargo segment where supply-demand imbalances directly led to unprecedented value creation. Some of the most prominent players in the aviation industry are American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON). To read more on the aviation industry, check out our coverage of the 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World.', 'According to Forbes, there are certain key trends which are likely to drive the continued rebound of the global aviation industry in 2024, the first being the facilitation of frictionless travel through the integration and implementation of biometric mechanisms. Some of the top players within the industry have ramped up investments in fingerprint and facial recognition technology, with much of it being tested in areas such as check-in, security lounge access, and boarding. According to multiple Reddit threads, exhaustive queues for security checks or at the baggage carousel continue to be one of the most popularly cited pain points for travelers. Furthermore, the frequent need to produce passports, identification documents, and boarding passes multiple times during the process is a further addition to the frustrations of the passengers. Hence, aviation companies are increasingly opting for biometric solutions to address these issues and streamline processes for an optimized travel experience. As of November 2023, the TSA has already unveiled plans to install fingerprint identification mechanisms across thirty airports in the United States to better facilitate passengers. In many of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean,\xa0similar actions have taken place to better facilitate passengers for a seamless travel experience.', 'Additionally, top aviation companies like American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) are increasing investments in the development of gen AI to humanize and customize experiences for travelers, especially in some of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean. The market for artificial intelligence within the aviation industry is expected to be valued at $2.2 billion by 2025. Although different use cases for AI integration into the aviation space are still taking shape, one of the most obvious uses for AI is with chatbots. The resultant sophistication boost for chatbots can aid in resolving consumer queries much more efficiently. Companies can also make use of advanced AI to timestamp much of the hardware that goes into the plane. This can result in enhanced safety, more effective inspections, optimized inventories, and an improved operational efficiency. This is likely to be complemented by another prevalent trend which is the increased integration of advance robotics in the aviation industry. Automation of workflows is a great antidote to the labor pool shortages currently afflicting the aviation sector post the pandemic. Robotics and automation can also aid in the streamlining of operational processes.\xa0', ""According to a report by McKinsey, airline retailing could value up to $40 billion by 2030. Since payments make for an important link between the consumer and the airline, they constitute an indispensable component of retailing. The report outlines that each year, more than 3 billion airline booking payment transactions are conducted across the world, generating more than $1 trillion. And despite the fact that these transactions make up for important value creation, they also result in more than $20 billion in payment costs which accounts for nearly three percent of the industry's cumulative revenue. Much of this can be attributed to the increased use of credit cards by consumers, especially in many of the   easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean."", 'Different intermediaries consisting of booking platforms and digital travel agencies have realized that payments present enormous potential for differentiation, with larger players like American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) ramping up investments in fintech solutions in order to streamline the end-to-end payment trajectory. As airlines rise to the value in airline retailing, they have begun to make a strategic retreat to improve payments in order to restrict disintermediation. Experts within the aviation industry have realized that retailing may lead to a $14 billion opportunity through the strategic management of payments. Moreover, an additional $2 billion in value rests upon the timely reduction of payment cost, especially for B2B transactions and corporate sales. In the face of shifting consumer expectations, the popularity of credit cards, the emergence of innovative point-of-sale devices, governmental support and incentivization, and evolution of the payment value chain, companies have begun to unlock unprecedented revenue opportunities in many of the easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean.

Out of the 700 islands located in the Caribbean, we used our consensus-based approach to shortlist 100 islands which appeared most frequently during our research as the most visited locations in the region. Since accessibility is incredibly multifaceted and complex to quantify, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the accessibility of each island; the criteria is premised on the flight availability at each island (20 points), flight frequency to and from each island (15 points), and airport infrastructure at each island (10 points). For flight-related information, we used data from a variety of different sources (1, 2, 3, 4). We then proceeded to award each island a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 25 islands which scored the highest points.

The company expects to improve Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution.

The hard seltzer category’s decelerating trend has mainly been attributed to the loss of novelty among consumers due to the entry of several beyond-beer products in the marketplace. Additionally, the decline has resulted from the ongoing dismal macroeconomic environment, which has caused a volume shift from hard seltzers back to premium light beers due to their lower pricing.For 2023, the company expects overall volumes to decline due to continued weakness in Truly volume, which is expected to partly offset strong growth in Twisted Tea.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase General Motors' shares before the 30th of November in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 14th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.09 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.36 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that General Motors has a trailing yield of 1.3% on the current share price of $28.18. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Motors ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. General Motors is paying out just 5.0% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether General Motors generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 5.0% of its cash flow last year."", ""It's positive to see that General Motors's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see General Motors has grown its earnings rapidly, up 100% a year for the past five years. General Motors looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. General Motors's dividend payments per share have declined at 11% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy."", ""Should investors buy General Motors for the upcoming dividend? It's great that General Motors is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. There's a lot to like about General Motors, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", 'With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

An incident in San Francisco, where a Cruise self-driving taxi was involved in a pedestrian accident, has further complicated matters and resulted in the revocation of the company's license to operate driverless rides in California.

The robust increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher revenues and improvement in gross margin.', 'Revenues more than tripled on a year-over-year basis and climbed 34% sequentially to $18.12 billion.', 'The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and recovery across the Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets due to the normalization of channel inventory.', 'Datacenter was +280% at $14.5B!', 'The top line also beat the consensus projection of $16.19 billion by 12%.', ""You can review my June and September projections for NVIDIA to hit $100 billion in annual revenues in\xa0this October report.

This improvement can be attributed to low-double-digit growth in CSF management and Neuro Monitoring driven by Certas Plus valves, BactiSeal catheters and ICP microsensors, high-single-digit growth in Dural Access and Repair driven by DuraGen DuraSeal and Mayfield, low single-digit decline in Advanced Energy due to timing of CUSA capital orders, and mid-single-digit growth in Instruments.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it.

Despite the challenges posed by heightened interest rates in the real estate sector, SBA continues to achieve growth in its funds from operations. Managing approximately 48,000 communication towers for telecom giants, the company mitigates most of the risks tied to traditional retail, commercial, or industrial REITs. With shares currently trading at a 40% discount from their 2021 high, I am bullish on the stock.', 'Despite overall market indices showing significant recovery, SBA Communications stock continues to trade approximately 40% below its 2021 peak of about $391. This situation arises from the fact that all REITs generally find themselves in a considerably more challenging position today compared to about two years ago. This is because the swift rise in interest rates during this period has had a detrimental impact on the very foundation of their business models.', 'To delve deeper into this issue, it’s crucial to understand that REITs are obligated to distribute the majority of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. To support property acquisitions and expansions, REITs frequently turn to debt and equity issuance, as they typically retain minimal income.', 'However, when interest rates are elevated, the cost of issuing debt rises, constraining a REIT’s capacity to expand through new investments. Simultaneously, the increased interest expenses on existing debt adversely affect current profitability.', 'SBA Communications mirrors this trend, as evidenced by the company’s total debt ballooning from $5.65 billion to $14.77 billion over the past decade as it pursued its tower portfolio expansion. This should explain why investors remain wary about SBA’s investment case relative to the rest of the rest of the market.', 'As I just highlighted, elevated interest rates impact all REITs, including SBA. Nonetheless, SBA stands out due to its distinctive strategy centered around telecommunication towers, giving it unique attributes that underpin a resilient performance. Unlike residential REITs grappling with soaring mortgages and commercial REITs contending with low occupancy rates, the telecom towers sub-industry demonstrates remarkable durability.', 'This resilience is attributed to the mission-critical nature of telecommunication towers, which serve as indispensable assets for industry giants like AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Thus, telecom giants prioritize meeting their lease obligations to ensure seamless network coverage. This results in a dependable cash flow stream for SBA with comparatively lower risks compared to other REITs specializing in more conventional asset classes.', 'SBA once again showcased its robust performance in the latest Q3 results, revealing an increase of 8.5% in leasing revenues. This growth can be attributed to an expanded tower portfolio and enhanced leasing activities. In particular, gross same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue experienced a substantial uptick of 8.8%. Domestically, the figures remain impressive, with a gross basis growth of 8.6% and a net basis growth of 4.7%, inclusive of a mere 3.9% churn.', 'As you can see, even during such a tough macroeconomic environment, SBA’s churn rate is remarkably low, underscoring the resilience of telecom towers. Continual escalations in contractual rent and a steady rise in tenancies per tower consistently surpass any instances of relocations or vacancies. This recurrent industry trend guarantees a sustained increase in leasing revenues.', 'Of course, grappling with the substantial impact of escalating interest rates, SBA has witnessed a notable deceleration in tower acquisitions and developments. Moreover, the company is paying notably higher interest expenses on its existing debt portfolio, which rose by about 14% year-over-year to reach $99.3 million in Q3.', 'Despite these challenges, SBA has demonstrated resilience through prudent cost management and impressive top-line performance, enabling the company to maintain robust profitability. Notably, adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) experienced a 7.3% year-over-year increase, totaling $364.1 million. On a per-share basis, AFFO increased by 7.7%, further amplified by strategic share buybacks.', 'With a robust Q3 performance from SBA, coupled with a strong first half of the year, the company’s management has elevated its FY2023 outlook. SBA is poised for growth, anticipating site leasing revenues between $2.510 billion and $2.520 billion (an increase from the previous range of $2.502 billion to $2.522 billion) and AFFO/share ranging from $12.91 to $13.13 (up from the previous forecast of $12.80 to $13.16).', 'Significantly, the midpoint of management’s projected guidance, standing at $13.02, hints at a noteworthy year-over-year surge of 6.9%. This figure might not immediately strike as remarkable. However, achieving robust high-single AFFO/share growth in a market where the majority of REITs are grappling with double-digit declines in profits is truly commendable.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on SBA Communications, the stock has gathered a Strong Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $252.27, the\xa0average SBA Communications stock price target\xa0implies 7.3% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SBA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital, with an average return of 11.86% per rating and a 64% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'SBA Communications emerges as a standout performer in the current challenging landscape for REITs. Despite facing headwinds from elevated interest rates, the company’s unique focus on telecommunication towers sets it apart, ensuring a resilient performance. Its Q3 results verify this theme, with impressive leasing revenue growth and a low churn rate.', 'While the effects of increasing interest rates found their way into SBA’s income statement, the company’s adept cost management and robust top-line performance have artfully set the stage for another year of record AFFO/share. However, despite outperforming its sector peers, SBA’s stock remains notably lower than its previous highs. This discrepancy suggests that it might be an opportune moment for investors to reevaluate SBA’s bullish case, which, in my perspective, presents a compelling opportunity.', 'Disclosure']"

The company's stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.The fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company's upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.Also, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.During the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Amphenol's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' See our latest analysis for Amphenol ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:', '24% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Amphenol has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Amphenol was able to see a decent net income growth of 15% over the last five years."", ""Next, on comparing Amphenol's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 15% over the last few years."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Amphenol fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', 'Amphenol has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.', ""Moreover, Amphenol is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 29% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 22%."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Amphenol's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R ""Ray"" Wang explains that ""it\'s not easy to get a chip out there. It\'s not easy to get a chip certified."" Wang tells Yahoo Finance Live that though this delay could leave an opening for Huawei, given how long it takes to develop a chip, it\'s going to be just as hard for other rivals to get into the market.', 'Elaborating on Huawei\'s opportunity, Wang says right now, it doesn\'t have the chips to compete with Nvidia. ""You\'re taking a Rolls-Royce to solve an AI problem, maybe they\'ll just use a few more Huawei chips, which would be the equivalent of getting a Ford or GM chip out there,"" Wang says adding that ""you don\'t always have to use the high-end chips to get to the answer and you might have some workarounds along the way.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', 'RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, taking a look at NVIDIA shares, they took a dip after reportedly delaying their new AI chip for China, despite being designed to comply with US export restrictions. Sources told Reuters that the delay was due to issues that server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip. For more on what this means for NVIDIA stock, we turn to Constellation Research founder and principal analyst Ray Wang.', 'Ray, always good to see you. So give us your take on this situation, because we knew some companies were going to try and find a workaround for the chip restrictions put on by the Biden administration. What does this mean for NVIDIA?', ""RAY WANG: Yeah, I think it's important to realize it's not easy to get a chip out there. It's not easy to get a chip certified. And so what NVIDIA is trying to do with the H20 chip to get out into China, it's going to take time, and it's not going to be just them. It's going to be everyone else. But it leaves an opening for Huawei to jump into that market, and that's what investors are reacting to."", ""But I think the flip side of this is that it's not easy getting a GPU or chip out the door. So all those people who think that NVIDIA is going to have competition right out the back, whether it's coming from AMD, whether it's coming from Microsoft in the future, or Google's TPUs or anybody else, it's not that easy to get a chip out the door. So if it takes NVIDIA a little hiccup to get this out the door, it's going to be just as hard for someone to come into the market."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: NVIDIA, Ray, certainly one of those names that is more exposed to the Chinese market. About a fifth of their revenue comes from there. In this particular case, though, you mentioned Huawei. Do they have the tech to match what NVIDIA would have offered here? I mean, these are chips that the company was building specifically for the Chinese market for the work around, the export controls.', ""RAY WANG: I could tell you're definitely right. It's not easy to do that. Does Huawei have the chips? The short answer is no at this moment, but keep in mind, like, you're taking a Rolls Royce to solve an AI problem. Maybe they'll just use a few more Huawei chips, which will be the equivalent getting a Ford or GM chip out there."", ""And I think that's the important thing is, like, you don't always have to use the high end chips to get to the answer, and you might have some workarounds along the way. And I think that's what China's going to be doing, especially with the export ban and the trade wars that are continuing.""]"

Per reports on the Insurance Portal, financial and professional lines, as well as cyber, remained soft. However, property insurance prices increased. Improvement in pricing drives premiums and thus eases claims payment.Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed made four hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 11 since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Genuine Parts' shares on or after the 30th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.95 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.80 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Genuine Parts has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $137.4. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Genuine Parts can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' View our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Genuine Parts's payout ratio is modest, at just 42% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 60% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies."", ""It's positive to see that Genuine Parts's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Genuine Parts's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Genuine Parts has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Genuine Parts has increased its dividend at approximately 5.9% a year on average. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Genuine Parts is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business."", ""Has Genuine Parts got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", ""While it's tempting to invest in Genuine Parts for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Genuine Parts that we recommend you consider before investing in the business."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase McDonald's' shares on or after the 30th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 15th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.67 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.08 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that McDonald's has a trailing yield of 2.4% on the current share price of $282.54. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ""  View our latest analysis for McDonald's  "", ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. McDonald's paid out 53% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether McDonald's generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (62%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see McDonald's's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. McDonald's is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. McDonald's has delivered an average of 8.0% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Is McDonald's worth buying for its dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. That's why we're glad to see McDonald's's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 53% and 62% respectively. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there."", ""So while McDonald's looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example, we've found  2 warning signs for McDonald's  that we recommend you consider before investing in the business."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend  checking our selection of top dividend stocks.

The decline in demand in 2023 was primarily due to milder temperatures in the first half of the year.

The application will now be reviewed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which will issue an opinion to the European Commission regarding the potential approval of this license expansion.', 'Data to support this submission includes the results of a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in people with rare non-F508del KAFTRIO®-responsive CFTR mutations. This study met its primary endpoint and showed that KAFTRIO® in combination with ivacaftor resulted in rapid, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function compared to placebo (9.2 percentage point increase in ppFEV1; P<0.0001; 95% CI [7.2, 11.3]).

CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the 30s, but with treatment, projected survival is improving.', 'About KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in Combination With Ivacaftor', 'In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein is not processed or folded normally within the cell, and this can prevent the CFTR protein from reaching the cell surface and functioning properly. KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to increase the quantity and function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by binding to different sites on the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, which is known as a CFTR potentiator, is designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane. The combined actions of ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor help hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.', 'KAFTRIO® (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in combination with ivacaftor is approved in the European Union for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.', 'For complete product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Coca-Cola's shares before the 30th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.46 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.84 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Coca-Cola has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of $58.57. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Coca-Cola's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Coca-Cola is paying out an acceptable 73% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 77% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Coca-Cola has grown its earnings rapidly, up 54% a year for the past five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend at approximately 5.1% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth."", ""Should investors buy Coca-Cola for the upcoming dividend? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Coca-Cola's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 73% and 77% respectively. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Coca-Cola from a dividend perspective."", ""In light of that, while Coca-Cola has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry has gradually digitalized a part of its healthcare solutions. In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)--powered technology services. Owing to the pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $35.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 21.4% between 2023 and 2030. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is skyrocketing healthcare costs.', 'On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc. DVA, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH, Addus HomeCare Corporation ADUS and The Pennant Group, Inc. PNTG are likely to gain from the prospects.', 'Industry Description', 'The industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.', 'Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare Industry', 'Cost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even conduct minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.', 'AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare, taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improving overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.', 'Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits where home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers), comprising a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care. Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With a rise in the elderly population and increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will rise. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.The rising demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient’s health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, their integration with AI has recently increased their popularity. Wearables have become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.', 'Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. Increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate the health workforce shortfall, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.', 'Zacks Industry Rank', 'The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'Before we present a few outpatient home health stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.', ""Industry's Stock Market Performance"", 'The industry has outperformed its sector but underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.', 'The industry has risen 3.7% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 13.8%.

Founded in 1965, Progressive is a leading independent agency writer of private passenger auto coverage, and the market share leader for the motorcycle products since 1998. Progressive operates through three business segments.', 'The Personal Lines (77% of 2022 Net Premium earned) segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted toward a specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. Personal Lines products comprise insurance for personal autos and special lines products. The agency business includes business written by Progressive’s network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California and strategic alliance business relationships (other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies). The direct business includes business written directly by the company online and over the phone.', 'The Commercial Lines (18%) segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The majority of its Commercial Auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Lines business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the business auto and specialty truck markets. The business auto market accounts for one third of its total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles Progressive insures in this business. The remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market, which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul commercial vehicles.', 'The Property (5%) segment writes personal property insurance, for homeowners, other property owners, and renters, in the Agency channel in over 31 states and the District of Columbia for personal property insurance and in over four states for commercial property insurance.', 'Bottom Line', ""Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Progressive, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2013 would be worth $5,876.76, or a 487.68% gain, as of November 24, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.', 'In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 152.48% and the price of gold went up 53.90% over the same time frame.', 'Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for PGR.', ""Progressive continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses.We expect net premiums written to rise by 18.2% in 2023. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.

Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties, residential real estate, and oil and gas assets.', 'Lack of Supply: There is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders. Meanwhile, the changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence.', 'Despite a continued decline in builder sentiment in November, recent macroeconomic indicators suggest a positive outlook for home construction in the upcoming months.

Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues and profitability.', 'Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. In September 2023, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rate unchanged after having raised its policy rate by 525 basis points (bps) since March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range (the highest level in the past 22 years) while leaving its options open on future rate hikes. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.', ""Tight Labor & Credit Markets: The shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global aviation and aerospace industry in 2024, go directly and see 10 Easiest Islands To Get To In the Caribbean.', 'As per numerous accounts, the rebound of the global aviation industry post the COVID-19 pandemic was not as impressive as was initially projected, with travelers complaining of exhaustive queues, delayed flights, and lost bags owing to severe labor shortages within the entire aviation ecosystem. As of November 2023 however, the aviation industry has regained much of its lost glory, with average operational profitability of the airline sector (EBIT) expected to recover to 2.8% by the end of the year, and net profits rising north of 1.2% to $9.8 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), operating profits are expected to reach $22.4 billion by January 2024, with total revenues expected to grow 9.7% year-on-year to $803 billion as of November 2023. This is the first time that the industry will post revenues north of $800 billion since the offset of the pandemic. According to the Director General of the IATA Willie Walsh:', '“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year. Economic uncertainties have not dampened the desire to travel, even as ticket prices absorbed elevated fuel costs. After deep COVID-19 losses, even a net profit margin of 1.2% is something to celebrate! But with airlines just making $2.25 per passenger on average, repairing damaged balance sheets and providing investors with sustainable returns on their capital will continue to be a challenge for many airlines.”', 'Before the onset of the pandemic in 2019, the aviation value chain tended to generate an annual financial loss of more than $5 billion between 2012 to 2019, according to McKinsey. This was primarily due to the fact that airlines were considered to be the weakest link in the aviation value chain, consistently leaking losses of more than $18 billion annually on average. The sub-par performance of airlines was usually attributed to certain entrenched challenges like low entry barriers, high exit barriers, sensitivity to external turbulence, the fragmented outlook of the industry at large, and an incredibly concentrated supplier terrain. This complicated atmosphere led to an uneven distribution of profits across the value chain, even with respect to some of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean.\xa0 These losses only exacerbated during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, as airlines lost more than $279 billion in two years of global lockdowns and flight suspensions. However, the industry was kept afloat by the air cargo segment where supply-demand imbalances directly led to unprecedented value creation. Some of the most prominent players in the aviation industry are American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON). To read more on the aviation industry, check out our coverage of the 15 Most Luxurious Airlines in the World.', 'According to Forbes, there are certain key trends which are likely to drive the continued rebound of the global aviation industry in 2024, the first being the facilitation of frictionless travel through the integration and implementation of biometric mechanisms. Some of the top players within the industry have ramped up investments in fingerprint and facial recognition technology, with much of it being tested in areas such as check-in, security lounge access, and boarding. According to multiple Reddit threads, exhaustive queues for security checks or at the baggage carousel continue to be one of the most popularly cited pain points for travelers. Furthermore, the frequent need to produce passports, identification documents, and boarding passes multiple times during the process is a further addition to the frustrations of the passengers. Hence, aviation companies are increasingly opting for biometric solutions to address these issues and streamline processes for an optimized travel experience. As of November 2023, the TSA has already unveiled plans to install fingerprint identification mechanisms across thirty airports in the United States to better facilitate passengers. In many of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean,\xa0similar actions have taken place to better facilitate passengers for a seamless travel experience.', 'Additionally, top aviation companies like American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) are increasing investments in the development of gen AI to humanize and customize experiences for travelers, especially in some of the  easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean. The market for artificial intelligence within the aviation industry is expected to be valued at $2.2 billion by 2025. Although different use cases for AI integration into the aviation space are still taking shape, one of the most obvious uses for AI is with chatbots. The resultant sophistication boost for chatbots can aid in resolving consumer queries much more efficiently. Companies can also make use of advanced AI to timestamp much of the hardware that goes into the plane. This can result in enhanced safety, more effective inspections, optimized inventories, and an improved operational efficiency. This is likely to be complemented by another prevalent trend which is the increased integration of advance robotics in the aviation industry. Automation of workflows is a great antidote to the labor pool shortages currently afflicting the aviation sector post the pandemic. Robotics and automation can also aid in the streamlining of operational processes.\xa0', ""According to a report by McKinsey, airline retailing could value up to $40 billion by 2030. Since payments make for an important link between the consumer and the airline, they constitute an indispensable component of retailing. The report outlines that each year, more than 3 billion airline booking payment transactions are conducted across the world, generating more than $1 trillion. And despite the fact that these transactions make up for important value creation, they also result in more than $20 billion in payment costs which accounts for nearly three percent of the industry's cumulative revenue. Much of this can be attributed to the increased use of credit cards by consumers, especially in many of the   easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean."", 'Different intermediaries consisting of booking platforms and digital travel agencies have realized that payments present enormous potential for differentiation, with larger players like American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) ramping up investments in fintech solutions in order to streamline the end-to-end payment trajectory. As airlines rise to the value in airline retailing, they have begun to make a strategic retreat to improve payments in order to restrict disintermediation. Experts within the aviation industry have realized that retailing may lead to a $14 billion opportunity through the strategic management of payments. Moreover, an additional $2 billion in value rests upon the timely reduction of payment cost, especially for B2B transactions and corporate sales. In the face of shifting consumer expectations, the popularity of credit cards, the emergence of innovative point-of-sale devices, governmental support and incentivization, and evolution of the payment value chain, companies have begun to unlock unprecedented revenue opportunities in many of the easiest islands to get to in the Caribbean.

Out of the 700 islands located in the Caribbean, we used our consensus-based approach to shortlist 100 islands which appeared most frequently during our research as the most visited locations in the region. Since accessibility is incredibly multifaceted and complex to quantify, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the accessibility of each island; the criteria is premised on the flight availability at each island (20 points), flight frequency to and from each island (15 points), and airport infrastructure at each island (10 points). For flight-related information, we used data from a variety of different sources (1, 2, 3, 4). We then proceeded to award each island a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 25 islands which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest.

(NASDAQ:PEP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase PepsiCo's shares on or after the 30th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 5th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.27 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.06 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current stock price of $169.37. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' See our latest analysis for PepsiCo ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 80% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether PepsiCo generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 94% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow."", ""While PepsiCo's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to PepsiCo's ability to maintain its dividend."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see PepsiCo's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, PepsiCo has increased its dividend at approximately 8.9% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is PepsiCo an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's good to see that earnings per share are growing and that the company's payout ratio is within a normal range for most businesses. However we're somewhat concerned that it paid out 94% of its cashflow, which is uncomfortably high. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there."", ""However if you're still interested in PepsiCo as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with PepsiCo.
