(NYSE:BR). The new solution allows Schwab Asset Management to poll fund shareholders to understand their overarching preferences regarding key proxy issues.""Voting shares of securities held by our funds is a duty Schwab Asset Management takes very seriously. We want to better understand shareholders’ views on important proxy issues, and we know more shareholders want to share their views with us and express their unique preferences through their investments,"" said Omar Aguilar, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at Schwab Asset Management. ""We are proud to be a leader in piloting this new tool for shareholder engagement.""Broadridge's new solution aims to provide an efficient and scalable way to gather general preferences across a large base of shareholders. The pilot will engage the shareholders of one Schwab Fund and two Schwab ETFs – the Schwab 1000 Index Fund (SNXFX), the Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK), and the Schwab Ariel ESG ETF (SAEF). Via the new service, investors will complete a survey that will provide insights into investors’ priorities on a range of core proxy issues concerning maximizing long-term shareholder value, company policies, corporate governance practices, and environmental and social issues. Shareholders will not be surveyed on specific proxy ballots.""Schwab's use of the new polling technology, developed by Broadridge, is another step forward in the democratization of investing,"" said Bob Schifellite, Broadridge's Investor Communication Solutions President. ""Broadridge continues to invest in technology platforms designed to enhance shareholder engagement and allow public companies and asset managers the opportunity to better reflect the views of investors.""Story continuesShareholders of the funds can expect to receive the poll via email or postcard beginning tomorrow through the next few weeks, with outreach to new shareholders of the funds occurring monthly.

Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn.Disclosures:The Schwab Ariel ESG ETF is different from traditional ETFs.Traditional ETFs tell the public what assets they hold each day. This fund will not. This may create additional risks for your investment. For example:You may have to pay more money to trade the fund’s shares. This fund will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.The price you pay to buy fund shares on an exchange may not match the value of the fund’s portfolio. The same is true when you sell shares. These price differences may be greater for this fund compared to other ETFs because it provides less information to traders.These additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions.The ETF will publish on its website each day a ""Proxy Portfolio"" designed to help trading in shares of the ETF. While the Proxy Portfolio includes some of the ETF’s holdings, it is not the ETF’s actual portfolio.The differences between this fund and other ETFs may also have advantages. By keeping certain information about the fund secret, this fund may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. This may improve the fund’s performance. If other traders are able to copy or predict the fund’s investment strategy, however, this may hurt the fund’s performance.For additional information regarding the unique attributes and risks of the fund, see Proxy Portfolio Risk, Premium/Discount Risk, Trading Halt Risk, Authorized Participant Concentration Risk, Tracking Error Risk and Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV in the Principal Risks and Proxy Portfolio and Proxy Overlap sections of the prospectus and/or the Statement of Additional Information.Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, or if available, the summary prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can obtain a prospectus, or if available, a summary prospectus by visiting schwabassetmanagement.com/prospectus. Please read it carefully before investing.Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares of ETF are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).The Schwab Ariel ESG ETF is an active semi-transparent (also known as a non-transparent ETF) and has additional risks associated with it. These risks are discussed in the next four paragraphs.Active Semi-Transparent (also known as Non-Transparent) ETF Risk: Active semi-transparent ETFs operate differently from other exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike other ETFs, an active semi-transparent ETF does not publicly disclose its entire portfolio composition each business day, which may affect the price at which shares of the ETF trade in the secondary market. Active semi-transparent ETFs have limited public trading history. There can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop, be maintained or operate as intended. There is a risk that the market price of an active semi-transparent ETF may vary significantly from the ETF’s net asset value and that its shares may trade at a wider bid/ask spread and, therefore, cost investors more to trade than shares of other ETFs. These risks are heightened during periods of market disruption or volatility.Proxy Portfolio Risk: Unlike traditional ETFs, this fund does not disclose its portfolio holdings (Actual Portfolio) daily. The fund instead posts a Proxy Portfolio on its website each day. The Proxy Portfolio is designed to reflect the economic exposures and risk characteristics of the fund’s actual holdings on each trading day, but it is not the same as the fund’s Actual Portfolio. Although the Proxy Portfolio is intended to provide investors with enough information to allow for an effective arbitrage mechanism that will keep the market price of the Fund at or close to the underlying NAV per Share of the Fund, there is a risk (which may increase during periods of market disruption or volatility) that market prices will vary significantly from the underlying NAV of the fund. ETF trading on the basis of a published Proxy Portfolio may trade at a wider bid/ask spread than ETFs that publish their portfolios on a daily basis, especially during periods of market disruption or volatility, and therefore may cost investors more to trade. Also, while the Fund seeks to benefit from keeping its portfolio information secret, market participants may attempt to use the Proxy Portfolio to identify a Fund’s trading strategy, which if successful, could result in such market participants engaging in certain predatory trading practices that may have the potential to harm the Fund and its shareholders.Proxy Portfolio Construction – The Proxy Portfolio is designed to recreate the daily performance of the Actual Portfolio. This is achieved by performing a ""Factor Model"" analysis of the Actual Portfolio. The Factor Model is comprised of three sets of factors or analytical metrics: market-based factors, fundamental factors, and industry/sector factors. The fund uses a ""Model Universe"" to generate its Proxy Portfolio. The Model Universe is comprised of securities that the fund can purchase and will be a financial index or stated portfolio of securities from which fund investments will be selected. The results of the Factor Model analysis are then applied to the Model Universe. The Proxy Portfolio is then generated as a result of this Model Universe analysis with the Proxy Portfolio being a small sub-set of the Model Universe. The Factor Model is applied to both the Actual Portfolio and the Model Universe to construct the fund’s Proxy Portfolio that performs in a manner substantially identical to the performance of its Actual Portfolio.The Proxy Portfolio will only include investments the fund is permitted to hold. The fund’s SAI contains more information on the Proxy Portfolio and its construction. Proxy Portfolio and Proxy Overlap Information regarding the contents of the Proxy Portfolio, and the percentage weight overlap between the holdings of the Proxy Portfolio and a Fund’s Actual Portfolio holdings that formed the basis for its calculation of NAV at the end of the prior Business Day (the Portfolio Overlap), is available by visiting the fund’s website www.schwabassetmanagement.com.Schwab Asset ManagementTM is the dba name for Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., the investment advisor for Schwab Funds and Schwab ETFs.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.33%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.1%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.22%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 5.66% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 14.71% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 11.67% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Texas Instruments as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, Texas Instruments is projected to report earnings of $2.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 14.49%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.11 billion, up 10.16% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.35 per share and revenue of $20.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.2% and +9.44%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

While the company’s revenues in the quarter are expected to have increased on a year-over-year basis, earnings are likely to have declined.In the last reported quarter, STT’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from new investment servicing wins, growth in net interest revenues (NIR) and a decline in expenses. Lower fee revenues and higher provisions acted as headwinds.State Street has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 6.82%, on average.State Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation price-eps-surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for State Street’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.80 per share. The consensus estimate has been revised marginally upward over the past seven days. The figure indicates a decline of 10% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $1.77, indicating a 9.6% fall.The consensus estimate of $3.01 billion for sales suggests an almost 1% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for sales is $3 billion, reflecting an increase of 0.5%.Major Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Net Interest Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $255.1 billion, which suggests a rise of 1.5% from the previous quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $246.5 billion.Moreover, lending activities continued at a decent pace in the third quarter. In addition to loan growth, there was a rise in interest rates in the quarter. The Federal Reserve raised rates by 150 basis points in total during the quarter. The policy rate now stands at the 3.0-3.25% range, the highest since 2008. Thus, loan growth, coupled with higher rates, is expected to have positively impacted STT’s NIR in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIR (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $637 million indicates a sequential rise of 8.5%. We project NIR on FTE basis to grow 6% to $622 million.Management projects NII to increase 5-9% sequentially, driven by the tailwind from the rate hikes. The outlook includes the expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in the third quarter.Fee Revenues: Significant volatility in the foreign exchange (FX) markets due to serious macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns is likely to have hurt State Street’s FX trading services income. The consensus estimate for the same is $315 million, suggesting a sequential decline of 4.8%. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $315.5 million.The consensus estimate for securities finance revenues of $113 million suggests a 5.6% rise from the previous quarter.The consensus estimate for servicing fees of $1.26 billion indicates a 3.2% sequential fall, while the consensus estimate for management fees of $472 million implies a 3.7% decline. Management expects both servicing fees and management fees to be down 4% quarter over quarter due to weaker market levels. Our estimates for servicing fees and management fees are $1.24 billion and $468.7 million, respectively.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee revenues of $2.35 billion indicates 1% decline from the previous quarter’s reported figure. We project the metric to fall 2.2% to $2.32 billion.Management expects total fee revenues to decline 2% on a sequential basis.Expenses: Due to higher information systems and communication expenses, as well as acquisition and restructuring costs, STT has been witnessing a steady rise in expenses over the past few quarters. The trend is likely to have persisted this time as well.Management expects expenses (excluding notable items) to increase just under 1% on a sequential basis, owing to the inflationary pressures on wages as the company continues to target productivity initiatives and execute against its strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline.We anticipate total non-interest expenses to increase 2.6% to $2.16 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model RevealsPer our proven model, the chances of an earnings beat for State Street this time are low. This is because the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -1.11%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Banks Worth a LookHere are a couple of bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley MS is +0.59% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3, at present.

14,c1277f31-e4f1-39ce-9910-62d0ca0c69e5,TMO,2022-10-13,7 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-value-stocks-too-cheap-121804398.html,1665317884,STORY,"['TGT', 'TMO', 'AMGN', 'DHR', 'INTU']","[With the global markets seeming poised to suffer a significant downturn, investors should prepare for this possibility by targeting cheap value stocks to buy. According to Investopedia.com, value-based investments refer to securities that trade at a price lower than the fundamentals imply. Such factors include dividends, earnings, or sales.Cheap value stocks contrast sharply with growth-centric names. While the latter enjoyed substantial momentum in 2021, at the time, the Federal Reserve accommodated such sentiments. Now that the central bank decisively pivoted to a hawkish monetary policy, growth names succumbed to massive pressure. While value plays also suffered, it’s broadly to a lower extent.Unusually, the market decides, for whatever reason, to harshly penalize certain companies over others. For contrarian investors, the red ink in the below cheap value stocks could represent a great opportunity considering the circumstances.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDHRDanaher$268.48AMGNAmgen$229.03TMOThermo Fisher$523.61HONHoneywell$171.41INTUIntuit$392.96TGTTarget$152.34VVisa$183.83Danaher (DHR)image of laptop screen displaying danaher (DHR) websiteSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAs a Fortune 500 science and technology innovator, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services. Recently, the company garnered attention for its coronavirus testing service. However, management warned earlier this year that demand for its diagnostics business would wane once Covid-19 becomes endemic.Still, an Edward Jones analyst saw circumstances differently, noting that “Covid-19 testing could become a regular or seasonal occurrence, much like flu tests are today.” The expert might have a point here. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. On a year-to-date basis through the Oct. 6 session, DHR slipped nearly 12%.While I understand some hesitation for Danaher, the bearishness might be stretching things too far. According to Gurufocus.com, DHR represents a modestly undervalued investment. The company features decent strength in its balance sheet. However, it comes alive in the growth and profitability departments, with several key performance metrics at least 60% or better against sector rivals. Therefore, DHR is an all-around solid candidate for buying cheap value stocks.Story continuesAmgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational biopharmaceutical company, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) focuses on discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics. To get there, Amgen leverages some of the most groundbreaking tools in the business, including advanced human genetics. Recently, the company released encouraging data regarding one of its therapeutics targeting lung cancer.Compared to other cheap-value stocks, Amgen performs comparatively well. Since the start of this year, AMGN has gained nearly 2%, which is much more than I can say about the major equity indices. Still, that seems a smooth performance, given the underlying relevancies.Indeed, Gurufocus.com labels AMGN as modestly undervalued. Amgen offers a range of solid income statement metrics relative to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.3%, which ranks better than nearly 58% of its peers. However, the biggest highlights center on the company’s profitability indicators. A notable stat is its net margin of 25%, rated better than 92% of pharma competitors.Thermo Fisher (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn American supplier of scientific instrumentation, reagents, and consumables, along with software services, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) essentially represents the stagehand of the broader scientific industry. While it might not be the star of the show, research and development couldn’t happen without Thermo Fisher’s product empire. Therefore, TMO should qualify as a strong value play under any circumstance.However, at this juncture, it’s also one of the cheap value stocks to buy. In the price chart, TMO is down more than 16% against its January opener. Fortunately, the volatility has died off in recent sessions. Still, in the trailing month, TMO declined by 2%. Wall Street might be acting irrationally here.According to Gurufocus.com, Thermo Fisher’s business is modestly undervalued. The company features a decent balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.06, reflecting limited bankruptcy risk. More importantly, it commands excellent growth and profitability metrics.TMO’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 18%, better than over 63% of the competition. Additionally, its net margin of 17.4% ranks higher than nearly 80% of the medical diagnostics and research sector.Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comA multinational industrial conglomerate and applied sciences firm, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) essentially does everything. Honeywell integrates relevancies across the broader business ecosystem from the mundane (from pre-pandemic standards), such as N95 masks, to the most innovative sectors, such as aerospace. When faced with a possible recession, it might be helpful to have a jack-of-all-trades investment.Wall Street broadcasts differing views like the other cheap value stocks. Since the start of 2022, HON has declined more than 15%. Part of the challenge associated with conglomerates is that they spread vulnerabilities across a wide surface. Therefore, investors may have lost their nerve with HON. Over time, though, former stakeholders might regret their decision.Per Gurufocus.com, HON rates as modestly undervalued. Contrarian investors will appreciate its robust profitability metrics. For instance, Honeywell features a return on equity of 28%, superior to 91% of its peers.As well it enjoys decent strengths in the balance sheet. For instance, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio pings at 2.3x, conspicuously lower than the industry median’s 3.4x.Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard.

Primarily, my argument centers on the burgeoning gig economy. Several projections demonstrate that gross volume for this sector will increase noticeably in the years ahead. However, it’s essential to realize that employees and gig workers (independent contractors) have different tax profiles.You can research the differences on your own, but the short of it is that gig workers’ taxes are pound-for-pound much more complicated than employees’ W2 filings. Therefore, Intuit represents a great fundamental value on the front and back ends (accounting and tax filings). Unfortunately, Wall Street doesn’t recognize this thesis, penalizing INTU with a 35% below-parity YTD performance.Its loss is your gain. Per Gurufocus.com, Intuit commands a modestly undervalued business. This is one of the rare cheap value stocks to buy, which features overall strengths: a solid balance sheet, excellent growth metrics, and robust profitability indicators.Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comFor the riskier portion of cheap value stocks, we’ll visit big-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT). Frankly, I hesitated to include this company on this list. Generally, its rival, shall not be named, enjoys a “better” market performance, down 9% for the year. In sharp contrast, TGT hemorrhaged nearly 33% of its value during the same period.Earlier this year, famous hedge-fund manager Michael Burry aimed at retailers like Target because of the bullwhip effect. Long story short, retailers overstated how much consumer demand will exist in the post-pandemic new normal.Now, many companies have a massive excess-inventory problem. While I don’t necessarily disagree, it’s fair to point out that Target benefits from everyday acquisitions. Now, people go to Target not just for discretionary purchases but also for the necessities like food.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com labels TGT as significantly undervalued. Believe it or not, against longer-term frameworks, Target enjoys solid growth and profitability metrics relative to its industry.If you’re a dice roller, TGT could be an enticing idea among cheap value stocks to buy.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comMathematically speaking, financial services provider Visa (NYSE:V) represents one of the cheap value stocks. Should you buy it, in any case? That’s where the narrative gets tricky. With Americans facing a possible recession with near-record levels of credit card debt, you’d imagine the first thing they will do is to try to get out of said liability. From that angle, V stock seems to tempt a bearish trajectory.In the market, Visa shares fell more than 16% YTD, so understandably, investors have concerns. On the other hand, financial credit allows some households to stretch their budgets to make ends meet. It’s a cynical view, sure, but it happens. And that should theoretically bolster Visa’s business.Now onto the math; Gurufocus.com considers V stock as significantly undervalued. Buying Visa stock is tempting because it just seems too cheap relative to the fundamentals. It features a favorable cash-to-debt ratio compared to industry norms. Regarding growth and profitability metrics, Visa owns excellent performance stats.Again, it’s tricky, with the complexities stemming from possible macro headwinds. Still, Visa stands on the compelling ground if you’re a gambler.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

He declined to comment on financial terms of the deal with CF Industries.""We see a tremendous opportunity to build a new business,"" Ammann told Reuters.The volumes of carbon dioxide that CF and Exxon could prevent from going to the atmosphere annually will be the equivalent of switching 700,000 gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles (EV), Ammann said.Exxon signed a parallel agreement to use Enlink Midstream's network to transport the CO2 to the storage site.While critics view carbon sequestration as greenwashing by polluters, Exxon says the business can achieve double-digit percentage returns while limiting planet-warming gases.Exxon's energy transition strategy is focused on curbing CO2 while increasing its oil and gas production - unlike European firms charting paths away from fossil fuels and toward renewable solar and wind power.The hydrocarbon-focused strategy and this year's surge in oil and gas prices have helped Exxon shares rise about 60% year to date, far ahead of Shell Plc and BP's.The Louisiana initiative is part of the company's planned $15 billion investment by 2027 in low carbon operations. About $9 billion of that will go toward reducing emissions at its own sites, with the remainder to carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels.(Reporting by Sabrina Valle; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Start-up for the project is scheduled for early 2025 and supports Louisiana’s objective of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.As previously announced, CF Industries is investing $200 million to build a CO2 dehydration and compression unit at its Donaldsonville, Louisiana, facility to enable captured CO2 to be transported and stored. ExxonMobil will then transport and permanently store the captured CO2 in secure geologic storage it owns in Vermilion Parish. As part of the project, ExxonMobil has signed an agreement with EnLink Midstream to use EnLink’s transportation network to deliver CO2 to permanent geologic storage. The 2 million metric tons of emissions captured annually will be equivalent to replacing approximately 700,000 gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles.""CF Industries is pleased to partner with ExxonMobil through this definitive CO2 offtake agreement, accelerating our decarbonization journey and supporting Louisiana’s and the country’s climate goals,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""This agreement also ensures that we remain at the forefront of the developing clean energy economy. As we leverage proven carbon capture and sequestration technology, CF Industries will be first-to-market with a significant volume of blue ammonia. This will enable us to supply this low-carbon energy source to hard-to-abate industries that increasingly view it as critical to their own decarbonization goals.""Story continues""This landmark project represents large-scale, real-world progress on the journey to decarbonize the global economy,"" said Dan Ammann, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. ""ExxonMobil is providing a critical and scalable solution to reduce CO2 emissions, and we’re ready to offer the same service to other large industrial customers in the state of Louisiana and around the world. We’re encouraged by the momentum we see building for projects of this kind, thanks to supportive policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act.""""EnLink has a system of over 4,000 miles of pipeline already in the ground in Louisiana,"" said Jesse Arenivas, Chief Executive Officer of EnLink. ""Utilizing this extensive network enables us to provide the most timely and cost-effective solution to CO2 transportation, with a significantly lower environmental impact. Because of this, EnLink is uniquely positioned to be the CO2 transportation provider of choice in Louisiana's Mississippi River corridor, which is a hub of industrial activity that is important to our economy. We look forward to working with ExxonMobil to help CF Industries and the State of Louisiana reach their decarbonization goals.""""Today’s announcement of this unprecedented, large-scale, low-carbon partnership is a key milepost on Louisiana’s path toward a brighter future for our climate, our economy and our people,"" said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. ""The collaboration and innovation to bring carbon capture and storage technology forward at this scale reaffirms our state’s ability to grow our economy without sacrificing our long-term emission-reduction goals to net zero by 2050.""CF Industries expects to market up to 1.7 million metric tons of blue ammonia annually. A chemical process is considered ""blue"" when CO2 emissions are captured before their release into the air, making the process more carbon-neutral. Demand for blue ammonia is expected to grow significantly as a decarbonized energy source for hard-to-abate industries, both for its hydrogen content and as a fuel itself, because ammonia’s components – nitrogen and hydrogen – do not emit carbon when combusted.ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions is working to bring lower-emission technologies to market, making them accessible to hard-to-decarbonize industries in the United States and internationally. It is focusing its carbon capture and storage efforts on point-source emissions, the process of capturing CO2 from industrial activity that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Once captured, the CO2 is injected into deep, underground geologic formations for safe, secure and permanent storage. In the United States, these storage efforts are regulated by state and federal agencies.Carbon capture and storage is a safe, proven technology that can enable some of the highest-emitting sectors to meaningfully reduce their emissions. These industries include manufacturing, power generation, refining, petrochemical, steel, and cement operations. With effective government policies in place, broad deployment of commercial-scale carbon capture and storage projects could create a new industry, resulting in job creation and economic growth.About CF IndustriesAt CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably.

Associates will also gain from DailyPay — a voluntary benefit wherein they can receive their earnings between traditional paydays.Moving on, the company has an education assistance program called ValuED, which provides financial support and a wide range of development opportunities for upskilling. As part of this, full-time associates will be eligible for tuition discounts and reimbursement allowances for college degrees, GED programs and language courses.Several other retailers have kicked off their hiring session for the holiday season through seasonal recruits that will improve customer shopping experiences. Retailers are increasingly focused on strengthening supply chains to avoid disruptions, which have been deterrents for a while.We note that supermarket giant Walmart WMT is leaving no stone unturned to leverage the upcoming holiday season. WMT unveiled plans to deploy 40,000 workers at more than 250 Walmart and Sam’s Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and transportation offices earlier this month.The new positions include seasonal store associates, customer service associates and 1,500 full-time truck drivers. Walmart employed 150,000 associates during the 2021 holiday season.Macy’s M announced plans to recruit 41,000 associates ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 48,000 seasonal associates for the 2021 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transit into permanent roles.Kroger KR recently unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. KR is likely to recruit 1,500 associates for full and part-time positions for their North Texas stores.Vacancies are available in all departments, including retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, supply chain, merchandising, logistics, corporate, pharmacy and healthcare. Kroger hired more than 20,000 associates through its nationwide hiring event for the 2021 holiday sale.Coming back to DLTR, all is not good in the hood for the company. Dollar Tree has been witnessing inflationary pressures and consumers’ shifts toward lower-margin consumable products. Its second-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected adverse impacts of freight expenses, markdowns, shrink and unfavorable product mix.As a result, the company announced plans to make competitive pricing investments in the Family Dollar chain to improve store productivity and profitability in the long run. Going forward, management expects gross and operating margins for the Family Dollar segment to remain pressured mainly due to the aforementioned pricing factor.The company estimates the mix shift to consumables to hurt Family Dollar by 300 basis points (bps). Driven by the accelerated price investment, it expects the Family Dollar segment to report a break-even operating margin in the second half, down from its first-half margin of 2%.Higher SG&amp;A expenses from elevated payroll, increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, and store facility costs remain concerning. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 24% due to higher repairs and maintenance costs, store payroll, stock compensation expenses, general insurance liability, utilities, and other inflationary pressures.Consequently, Dollar Tree lowered the earnings per share view for fiscal 2022. Management envisions earnings of $7.10-$7.40 per share for fiscal 2022 compared with the prior stated $7.80-$8.20 per share. The company anticipates earnings of $1.05-$1.20 per share for the fiscal third quarter.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock plunged 14.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

30,e67e6f22-2f62-374f-be08-55dc464fcc29,JWN,2022-10-13,"CFOs at Block, Meta, Workday, Nordstrom, and Estée Lauder explain how their roles are evolving",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cfos-block-meta-workday-nordstrom-111301100.html,1665573181,STORY,"['EL', 'JWN']","[Good morning,How is the role of CFOs changing?That was a topic of discussion during “The New CFO” panel at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, California, on Monday. I had the opportunity to talk with finance chiefs at Block, Nordstrom, Workday, The Estée Lauder Companies, and the incoming CFO at Meta about what they’re experiencing.“I really see the CFO role as being an increasingly strategic one that helps our company balance aspiration and discipline,” said Amrita Ahuja, CFO at Block, a financial services company. Aspirations are the big business opportunities Block wants to address, and discipline is measuring the effectiveness of Block's investments, Ahuja said. “The CFO role is well placed because we have real-time data across our entire business.”Being strategic is an important element of the role, but CFOs have also become “the counselor, the influencer, the truth-teller,” Nordstrom CFO Anne Bramman said. “But it’s also being a leader,” Bramman said. “It’s not just the financial piece or the strategic piece, it’s how are you leading across the organization? Because many times, we’re the most senior women in the room.”CFOs are tasked to ""drive operation change, guide business strategy, and create value beyond just the financial statement,” Workday CFO Barbara Larson said. Businesses are also looking to CFOs to focus on “how you can leverage technology and think about data in new ways,” Larson said. “And how do you reinvent the way you think of talent as well?”“I will soon be a brand new CFO,” said Susan Li, the VP of finance at Meta, who will begin her new position on Nov. 1. “Traditionally, people have thought of CFOs as a steward"" and that includes ""running a tight finance ship,"" Li said. But today, CFOs wear so many more hats, like ""the efficient operator hat,” Li said. “The CFO is really a partner in steering the business direction and product vision for the company.”Story continuesCFOs today have “a co-pilot role,” Tracey Travis, EVP, and CFO at The Estée Lauder Companies, said. “Many companies don’t have COOs, or are thinking of doing away with the role,” Travis explained. “So the CFO role has become much broader in recent years.”Tech and finance alignmentThe leaders noted the importance of collaboration between finance and IT teams.""Tech planning and business planning go hand in hand,"" Li said. ""We have parts of our finance team dedicated to deconstructing tech problems and figuring out how to design and implement the digital transformation process.""“Thirty percent of our business is digital...and 75% of our investments are in tech,” Bramman said. ""It’s an enormous piece of our infrastructure and an enormous piece of what we’re spending our money on,"" she said.At Block, ""the business technology team and finance team partner to build automated tools, systems, and dashboards so product teams can get real-time access to data,"" Ahuja said.“I think it's critical for IT to have a seat at the table,” Larson said. The first step for CFOs is finding new ways to work with CIOs, she says. “We have a vision at Workday to get to a zero-day close, and just streamline our process,” Larson explained. “We can't do that by ourselves. We have to be in lockstep with our IT partners.""At Estée Lauder, IT reports to Travis. ""Strategic IT plays a very important role,” she said.In the current macro environment, the leaders noted that their companies are making decisions with a long-term strategy in mind. ""As we are navigating the increasing financial uncertainty and volatility, I think like many people in this room, we are building out our financial plans and budgets for next year,"" Li said. Meta is looking at operating expenses, capital expenditures, and headcount, she said. ""We expect that we are going to be slowing headcount growth steadily throughout the next year,” Li said.“I think everyone is looking at how to reprioritize investment decisions aligned with the growth models of the company,” Travis said. “And it’s one of the most important roles that a CFO can play. Where do you invest? And where do you disinvest?"" The decisions on disinvesting can be tough but necessary choices, Travis said.See you tomorrow.Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: A 2007 flashback: home flippers are in trouble againManaging Gen Z is like working with people ‘from a different country’The Renault Nissan empire once held together by fugitive Carlos Ghosn may slowly be unravelingPayPal tells users it will fine them $2,500 for misinformation, then backtracks immediately]"

It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Equity Residential shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Equity Residential is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry that ranks in the Top 12% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 90 cents per share to 91 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Equity Residential right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

32,e0d676a5-a1f4-33ec-be46-9edded92124c,XYL,2022-10-13,Water Utilities Set the Pace in Race To Reduce Carbon Emissions,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/water-utilities-set-pace-race-134000830.html,1665582000,STORY,['XYL'],"[Leading utilities show how water sector could become one of the fastest to decarbonize using existing technologies at low costA medium-sized water utility could reduce emissions equal to 150 transatlantic flights per yearWASHINGTON, DC / ACCESSWIRE / October 12, 2022 / More than 80 water and wastewater utilities worldwide have set net-zero and climate-neutrality targets.1 These utilities are leading the decarbonization of the water sector with strategies that optimize operations while cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A new paper from global water technology company Xylem (NYSE:XYL), Net Zero: The Race We All Win, shows how water managers are reducing their emissions and making infrastructure more resilient to climate change.""We have an opportunity to help the water sector be the fastest to reduce its carbon emission footprint. Utilities, already on the frontlines of the effects of climate change and aging infrastructure, and passionate public servants, are the key,"" said Patrick Decker, President and CEO of Xylem. ""This paper and action show how leading water utility managers are delivering real progress toward net-zero goals. And these examples show how quickly and affordably they are doing it, while optimizing their overall operations. The technology exists to address these challenges, and the time to make a difference is now.""Water infrastructure accounts for approximately 2% of global GHG emissions - the same as the global shipping industry. Net Zero: The Race We All Win, which is available to download, highlights pragmatic approaches and proven technologies that can reduce water utility emissions to net zero. The methods used by pace-setting utilities include:Create a smart net-zero strategy - realistic, measurable targets towards emissions-reduction goalsOptimize energy and resources across a network - cost-neutral strategies to reduce emissions while ensuring process stabilityEmbed net-zero goals in capital planning - net-zero criteria that fold into existing processes and the flow of day-to-day decision-makingMove from treatment to resource recovery - from wastewater as a by-product to be managed to a resourceStory continuesAmong the success stories highlighted in the paper is the City of South Bend, Indiana. The city used technology to reduce combined sewer overflow volume by more than 70 percent. This prevented needless construction of new grey infrastructure and eliminated the associated embedded carbon. The city improved system performance and capacity utilization, and delivered environmental gains 10 to 15 years ahead of schedule.""While the headline figure of our work was that the city has saved approximately $500 million in capital work savings, the impact on our carbon footprint should not be overlooked. By avoiding a large construction project and prolonging the life or our infrastructure through smart technology, we have made a major impact in reducing our carbon footprint,"" said Kieran Fahey, Director, Long-Term Control Plan at the Department of Public Works, City of South Bend.In another example, EWE WASSER GmbH (EWE) in Cuxhaven, one of Germany's largest wastewater companies, reduced energy use by 30 percent in part of its operations. Its plant has the capacity to treat wastewater for 400,000 people, and the reductions saved 1.1 million kWh annually, enough energy to power 275 homes for one year, while ensuring high water quality.Xylem executives will be leading decarbonization conversations at WEFTEC 2022 and European Energy Efficiency Day this week, and at the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt next month.Xylem was named ""Net Zero Carbon Champion"" at the 2022 Global Water Awards. This award recognized the Company's work to accelerate the decarbonization of the water sector and its pledge to partner with utilities, businesses, and water managers around the world to help reduce their carbon footprint. It also acknowledged the Company's commitments in sustainability: in the last two years the Company has already reduced the CO2 footprint of its water customers by over 1 million metric tons.1https://www.globalwaterintel.com/water-without-carbonAbout XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving critical water and infrastructure challenges with innovation.

Ticker symbol, NCLH. It's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analysts also setting a $15 price target on the stock here. And particularly, they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian, it's Royal Caribbean. Caribbean? Caribbean? Anyway, Carnival Cruise Line, that's pronounced the same way.They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation. And essentially here, when you think about the broader cruise sector, of course there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at, just to reengage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage-takers.But then it's also, on the other side, how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models and trying to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operators.- Yeah. Interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise, you have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, weak ticket pricing notably coming out of Carnival Cruise line. Look, we just talked to Norwegian's CFO mark Kemp last week. And he said demand is strong, we're charging higher prices.- If you look at Q3 in our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So, again, inflation is real, it is starting to level off, we are going to see some near-term pressure on margins, but we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvements significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic.- There you go. Really, a bullish take by Kemp, who came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian. And, of course, all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance. But still, delivering a mighty new beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima.- Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here, as well within this call they said they see this as the most preferred name. And it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strength.]"

The Poll found that inflation is the leading catalyst for DB plan sponsors to initiate a PRT.""The economic landscape has shifted significantly since our last Poll and this change has led DB plan sponsors to take a closer look at their plans and pension risk transfer options,"" says Elizabeth Walsh, head of Pension Solutions at MetLife. ""Not only is inflation a factor, but other considerations, such as market volatility and rising interest rates, can potentially impact the decision to move forward with PRT.""The Poll found macroeconomic concerns are prompting plan sponsors to hold steady or even accelerate their plans to de-risk. These include the geopolitical environment (96%), market volatility (94%), rising interest rates (91%), COVID-19’s transitional phase between pandemic and endemic (91%), and inflation (86%). In fact, according to the Poll, 9 in 10 plan sponsors (92%) say that continued rising interest rates will make them more likely to move forward with a pension risk transfer, including 43% who say a PRT is much more likely if interest rates continue to rise.Facing this economic uncertainty, C-suites have taken a more active role in the management of their DB plans. Nine in ten plan sponsors (93%) say their pension receives significant attention from corporate management because of the financial effects that volatility and related risks place on their balance sheet/income statement.Looking to the Future""2022 is shaping up to be another record year for the PRT market and we don’t anticipate activity will slow down for the foreseeable future,"" says Walsh. ""It is clear from our Poll’s findings that pension de-risking is top of mind for many DB plan sponsors. In fact, 95% of plan sponsors say their company routinely weighs their DB plan’s value against the cost of the benefit.""Story continues2021 was a record year for pension risk transfer industry with sales of $38 billion. According to the Poll, plan sponsors expect this level of activity to continue in the years to come. Sixty-four percent of plan sponsors predict the number of large PRT transactions will likely increase in the next five years and 18% believe the high level will stay the same.Plan sponsors may be basing these predictions on their own intentions. The Poll found nearly nine in ten plan sponsors (89%) say they are likely to consider a PRT option from an insurance company in the next five years and 35% of this group say it’ll be within two years.Increased Interest in Annuity BuyoutsWhen asked about the type of PRT activity plan sponsors will most likely use to achieve their de-risking goals, 57% say they will use an annuity buyout (including 28% who plan to use a combination of an annuity buyout and a lump sum). That’s up significantly from two years ago when 34% of plan sponsors said they would use a buyout only or buyout in combination with a lump sum.Among those seeking an annuity buyout, many plan sponsors (62%) will secure a buyout for a retiree lift-out, while only 21% will secure a buyout for a plan termination and 17% don’t yet know their approach. Moving forward, a majority of plan sponsors will take a phased approach to de-risking. According to the Poll, two in three plan sponsors plan to tranche their transactions with a series of annuity buyouts (63%) rather than a single annuity buyout transaction (37%).About the StudyThe MetLife 2022 Pension Risk Transfer Poll was fielded between July 8, 2022 and July 15, 2022. MetLife commissioned MMR Research Associates, Inc. to conduct the online survey. Survey responses were received from 251 DB plan sponsors with $100 million or more in plan assets who have de-risking goals. This included 57% of plan sponsors who reported DB plan assets of $500 million or more.About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

Data confirmed German harmonised inflation was 10.9% y/y in September and almost 10% in Sweden, but all eyes are on U.S. consumer price inflation data due at 1230 GMT.Paul O'Connor, Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors, said the question investors have is whether central banks like the Fed are getting close to the end of their interest rate hikes.""Are we there yet? My feeling is that we are quite close to pricing in peak rates, but on the growth story I think there are probably a lot of downgrades still to come,"" he said.Interest rate hikes take a year to 18 months to fully take effect. As a result ""it is quite plausible that around the end of the year, the central banks declare a pause...labour markets will be cooling and housing markets will be falling.""Story continuesThe headline U.S. CPI figure is expected to have slipped back two tenths of a percentage point to a still-bruising 8.1%, but the 'core' number which strips out the more volatile components is forecast to rise again to 6.5% from 6.3%.Minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting released on Wednesday showed many officials ""emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action"".Several policymakers did stress, however, that it would be important to ""calibrate"" the pace of further rate hikes to reduce the risk of ""significant adverse effects"" on the economy.Treasury yields were choppy in Europe. The U.S. 10-year benchmark yield initially ticked up to 3.923% but then dropped back to 3.894% with most of the equivalent European yields down a touch too.Markets lay 90% odds for another 75 basis-point Fed rate hike in November, versus 10% probability of a half-point bump.CONCERNEDIn Asia, widespread equity market weakness had seen Japan's Nikkei slip 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi tumble 1.8% as news that Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC was seeing demand drop and was cutting its investment budget by at least 10% hit the wider region's tech sector.Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.9% and mainland Chinese blue chips lost 0.3% to leave MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares close to 2 1/2-year lows.U.S. emini stock futures offered some hope though, rising 0.5% after the S&amp;P 500's sixth straight drop on Wednesday.""The risk of an over-tightening episode and some mishap in financial markets is higher than I can remember,"" said Tom Nash, a fixed income portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management in Sydney.HEROICThe dollar index, which gauges the greenback against six major rivals, inched down to 112.92 ahead of the CPI data.The U.S. currency remained close to a fresh 24-year high to the yen and last changed hands at 146.79 while sterling roared up almost 1.5% to $1.1263 on the reports of possible tax cut changes. It had hit two-week trough of $1.0925 on Tuesday.Benchmark 10-year gilt yields, which erupted after the UK government laid out tax cutting plans last month, had swung from a fresh 14-year peak at 4.632% to 4.249% in early afternoon trading.The Bank of England has insisted that its emergency bond market support will expire on Friday as originally announced, countering media reports of continued aid if necessary.BoE Governor Andrew Bailey had riled markets on Tuesday by saying British pension funds and other investors hit hard by a slump in bond prices had until that deadline to fix their problems.""I would say it's heroic to say the risk of some sort of systemic problem has been extinguished because these are big moves and we don't now how much deleveraging needs to be done,"" Janus Henderson's O'Connor said. ""Markets still feel very dysfunctional"".Meanwhile, crude oil markets regained their footing following a 2% slide on Wednesday amid worries over demand.Brent crude futures bounced 23 cents, or 0.25%, to $92.69 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 21 cents, or 0.2%, at $87.44 a barrel.Last week, the producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia pushed prices higher when it agreed to cut supply by 2 million barrels per day (bpd).(Additional reporting by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Editing by Alexander Smith, Kirsten Donovan)]"

On top of that, Hurricane Ian forced offshore producers in the U.S. to scale back production.Even the head of Saudi Arabia’s state-led oil company, Saudi Aramco, is concerned. Earlier this month, he issued a dire warning that prices could spike soon due to Aramco's “extremely low” capacity.Which means Americans should be preparing for a very expensive winter.But with President Biden set to release 25 million more barrels of the country’s “oil piggy bank” to the market by the end of the year and the supply of diesel running dangerously low, many Americans may be wondering why not just hold onto that supply to keep the lights on here?At $60 or more for a tank, it can be frustrating to watch as domestic oil leaves U.S. ports faster than foreign oil comes in. But it’s a decades-old challenge, and only the nature of the crisis has changed.Don't missOver 65% of Americans don't shop around for a better car insurance deal — and that could be costing you $500 a monthYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income every quarter)A TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by cash stuffing – can it work for you?Leading from behindThe United States is the world’s top producer of oil (including crude, other petroleum liquids, and biofuels) and has been since 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, it’s not even close.The EIA reports that as of 2021, the U.S. produced 18.88 million barrels per day — or about 10 million per day more than no. 2 Saudi Arabia (10.84 million) and no. 3 Russia (10.78 million).The EIA also notes that the U.S. is the largest oil consumer, using 20.54 million barrels a day, or 20% of the global stock, and well ahead of no. 2 China (14.01 million). The U.S. imported 7.86 million barrels of oil per day last year, the EIA report reveals.Story continuesSo if America is producing roughly the same amount of oil as it imports, and interest in renewables is rising, shouldn’t it be true that the U.S. would not be so reliant on foreign oil, and that energy price anxieties should subside because U.S. stocks would be more than adequate?Not by a long shot.Oil price and politicsThe reasons for the import/export discrepancy are actually fairly straightforward. Chief among them:Foreign oil is cheaper: The cost of extraction is usually lower in other countries.Rystad Energy, a private energy research firm, found in a 2020 analysis that Middle Eastern oil fields have the world’s lowest production cost at $31 a barrel. The U.S. produced oil from deepwater wells was at $43 a barrel, with fracking-produced oil costing $44 a barrel.Energy as a weapon: Prices are frequently connected to how nations regard the environmental, economic and geopolitical impacts of their oil.Some concerns weigh heavier than others. Russia, for instance, is widely seen as using oil as a tool to gain concessions over its invasion of Ukraine.Read more: The great escape: Rich young professionals earning over $100K are fleeing California and New York — here's why and where they are headedThe Russian invasion eventually prompted President Biden to sign a ban on Russian oil imports, but it’s unclear how much the ban has deterred Vladimir Putin. Europe now faces new uncertainty about accessibility to critical Russian oil ahead of winter.Not all oil is the same: This is a fundamental challenge for the U.S., where much of the nation’s refining capacity is built to handle the heavy, harder-to-refine crude imported from the Middle East and elsewhere. That U.S. capacity wasn’t aimed at refining the kind of light, sweet crude that characterizes the flush oil fields of Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere.Shifting U.S. refining capacity to light crude could create incredible upheaval in the market and jeopardize enormous existing investments, the American Petroleum Institute says.Attempts to correct that mismatch have almost always stalled out, often over environmental protests or other political realities. Most believe the current situation won’t change until new refining capacity comes online or the current capacity is upgraded to handle what the U.S. produces. The costs of such a shift would be enormous.What to read next‘Unhealthy and unsustainable’: Homebuyers aren’t buying and homebuilders aren’t building in the face of untamed mortgage ratesThe US now has just 25 days of diesel supply — the lowest since 2008.

The bank's $11.69 billion profit at the time would have been $9.59 billion without the $2.1 in reserve releases.With expectations a recession is underway, inflation still persistently high, and savings accounts that were buoyed by fiscal stimulus checks dwindling, banks are preparing a line of defense in case some customers can't pay up on loans.""It's very much banks taking a slightly more conservative approach,"" Jackson explained. ""Just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession in 2023, so I think banks just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that.""Story continuesAmong those market participants is JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, who said earlier this week that the economy may be in a recession by mid-next year.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon testifies during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill September 22, 2022. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)And over the last few months, Dimon has highlighted headwinds such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, deteriorating consumer confidence, and “never-before-seen quantitative tightening.""""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said Monday in an interview with CNBC.JPMorgan set aside $428 million for loan loss reserves in the second quarter and $902 million in such funds during the first quarter, according to earnings statements.JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with financials from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) due out next week.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:The early 2022 Q3 results don’t inspire a lot of confidence about the overall earnings picture. At this admittedly early stage, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus estimates that had already come down significantly.For the 21 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported Q3 results already, EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the lowest levels in the preceding 20 reporting cycles (5 years).Looking at 2022 Q3 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +0.1% from the same period last year on +9.1% higher revenues. Excluding contributions from the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be -6.8% below the year-earlier level.We are off to a rough start in the early Q3 results that have been coming out. All of these early reports have been from companies reporting results for their fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of our September-quarter tally.We have seen such Q3 results from 21 S&amp;P 500 members already. Our comment about the ‘rough start’ that these results aren’t just about the disappointing results from the likes of FedEx FDX, Nike NKE, Carnival CCL and others, but rather how so few of these companies have been able to beat estimates that had already come down significantly.The proportion of these 21 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates is the lowest in the last 5 years.Story continuesIt is premature to read too much into these early results. But it does appear that the market’s anxieties about corporate profitability may be coming to fruition this earnings season.The flip side of this argument is that if results turn out to be less bad than what reports from FedEx, Carnival and others suggest, then the market will be relieved and we may see a replay of what we saw in the Q2 earnings season when results weren’t great, but they weren’t bad either.That said, the strong U.S. dollar has joined the pre-existing headwinds of logistical challenges and inflationary pressures in weighing on corporate profitability. We will have to wait and see whether the Q3 reporting cycle will bring in the long-feared earnings downturn.As we have been pointing out here, estimates have been coming down, with the overall revisions trend remaining negative even after accounting for the persistent favorable trend enjoyed by the Energy sector.We see this trend of negative estimate revisions at play with the next few quarters as well as with full-year 2023 estimates.Aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector have declined -6.9% since mid-April, with double-digit percentage declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech. Estimates have been coming down in the Industrial Products, Medical and Finance sectors as well.The Overall Earnings PicturePlease note that a big part of this year’s growth is thanks to the strong momentum in the Energy sector whose earnings are on track to grow +141.0% this year. Excluding this extraordinary Energy sector contribution, earnings growth for the rest of the index would be down -0.1%. This flat earnings picture for this year is also in-line with the economic ground reality.Earnings next year are expected to be up +6.1% as a whole and +7.9% excluding the Energy sector. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are typically in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down -6.9% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden-variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: The early 2022 Q3 results don’t inspire a lot of confidence about the overall earnings picture. At this admittedly early stage, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus estimates that had already come down significantly.  For the 21 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported Q3 results already, EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking the lowest levels in the preceding 20 reporting cycles (5 years). Looking at 2022 Q3 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +0.1% from the same period last year on +9.1% higher revenues. Excluding contributions from the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be -6.8% below the year-earlier level. We are off to a rough start in the early Q3 results that have been coming out. All of these early reports have been from companies reporting results for their fiscal quarters ending in August, which we count as part of our September-quarter tally.We have seen such Q3 results from 21 S&amp;P 500 members already. Our comment about the ‘rough start’ that these results isn’t just about the disappointing results from the likes of FedEx FDX, Nike NKE, Carnival CCL and others, but rather how so few of these companies have been able to beat estimates that had already come down significantly.The proportion of these 21 index members beating EPS and revenue estimates is the lowest in the last 5 years.It is premature to read too much into these early results. But it does appear that the market’s anxieties about corporate profitability may be coming to fruition this earnings season.The flip side of this argument is that if results turn out to be less bad than what reports from FedEx, Carnival and others suggest, then the market will be relieved and we may see a replay of what we saw in the Q2 earnings season when results weren’t great, but they weren’t bad either. Story continuesThat said, the strong U.S. dollar has joined the pre-existing headwinds of logistical challenges and inflationary pressures in weighing on corporate profitability. We will have to wait and see whether the Q3 reporting cycle will bring in the long-feared earnings downturn.As we have been pointing out here, estimates have been coming down, with the overall revisions trend remaining negative even after accounting for the persistent favorable trend enjoyed by the Energy sector.We see this trend of negative estimate revisions at play with the next few quarters as well as with full-year 2023 estimates. The chart below shows how the expected aggregate total earnings for full-year 2023 have evolved on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector have declined -6.9% since mid-April, with double-digit percentage declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech. Estimates have been coming down in the Industrial Products, Medical and Finance sectors as well.The Overall Earnings PictureThe chart below provides a big-picture view of earnings on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, with the growth momentum expected to continue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that a big part of this year’s growth is thanks to the strong momentum in the Energy sector whose earnings are on track to grow +141.0% this year. Excluding this extraordinary Energy sector contribution, earnings growth for the rest of the index would be down -0.1%. This flat earnings picture for this year is also in-line with the economic ground reality.Earnings next year are expected to be up +6.1% as a whole and +7.9% excluding the Energy sector. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are typically in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down -6.9% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden-variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strong.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: FE), is offering Google Nest thermostats for $1 to customers now through the end of the year to help residents across the Garden State take control of their energy use. The initiative, offered by all utilities statewide in conjunction with Google Nest, is designed to help lower energy bills for customers amid rising temperatures and inflation.JCP&amp;L Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)According to Rutgers State of the Climate: New Jersey 2021 report, the state's annual temperatures have increased by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, roughly twice the global average, causing energy bills to rise as residents cool their homes. Smart thermostats allow customers to automate household energy use and keep energy consumption low, without sacrificing comfort. Independent studies have found that on average, Nest thermostats save users 10% to 12% on heating and 15% on cooling costs.""By implementing energy efficiency initiatives like smart thermostats, JCP&amp;L customers can take more control of their electric bills and enjoy a comfortable home environment at a lower cost in the long term,"" said Nicole Williams, manager of residential energy efficiency programs for FirstEnergy. ""Offering smart thermostats at a greatly discounted price boosts accessibility so all customers can access this important energy-saving tool.""The Nest thermostat is easy to use with multi-language capabilities and simple settings. It's compatible with the Google Home app, allowing users to schedule and control the home's temperature remotely through the internet and wi-fi. Built-in HVAC monitoring makes sure heating and cooling systems are running smoothly. If something doesn't seem right, it can send an alert. The thermostat also provides helpful reminders, such as prompts to change air filters and suggestions for routine maintenance. While these alerts are meant to provide helpful information, they are not intended to replace the diagnosis by a qualified HVAC professional.Story continuesThe promotion is active for all JCP&amp;L customers now until December 31, 2022. Full details of the offer, including terms and conditions, can be accessed through JCP&amp;L's online energy efficiency marketplace at www.marketplace.energysavenj.com.As summer weather turns colder, JCP&amp;L also encourages customers to follow simple energy-saving tips to effectively manage electricity use:When temperatures drop, reverse the direction of ceiling fans in your home. This will pull the cool air up from the ground while pushing warm air near the ceiling downwards.Open the curtains and window blinds to let sunlight in from south-facing windows to help warm the room without using extra energy. In the evening, close them to hold in heat.Open windows during moderate weather in the fall for cooling instead of operating air conditioning equipment.Find more energy-saving tips at www.firstenergycorp.com/save_energy.JCP&amp;L serves 1.1 million customers in the counties of Burlington, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.

Our Practical Sustainability philosophy guides our sustainability strategy through the lens of our Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize approach.Our Practical Sustainability philosophy highlights strategic and transformational stewardship that can lead to long-term success, innovation in products and operations, demand for solutions, and progress transparency. This philosophy, in alignment with our regularly conducted materiality assessments, directs our environmental strategy.Throughout FedEx, our team members help guide our strategy by applying our Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize approach to current environmental initiatives.REDUCE: Reduce or eliminate impacts from activities or operationsREPLACE: Use the right solutions in the right applicationsREVOLUTIONIZE: Discover and utilize the technologies and solutions of tomorrow, todayOur efforts aim to mitigate environmental impacts, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and protect against future risks. By implementing our Practical Sustainability philosophy and our Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize approach, we bring value to our organization and our stakeholders while making strategic progress against our goals.Around the world, FedEx is also working with the logistics industry and with the communities we serve to move goods more sustainably and design cities for a better future. We collaborate with non-profit organizations that provide innovative solutions to reduce the carbon footprint of the transportation industry through the Sustainable Logistics pillar of our FedEx Cares program.Climate changeFedEx understands the impacts climate change poses to our business, such as intensifying weather events, emerging GHG emissions regulations, increased media and investor attention, and enhanced customer demands to address environmental challenges. While climate change poses strategic risks to our business and our stakeholders, it also presents opportunities as we advance our sustainability strategy.Story continuesWe identify and evaluate physical and transition climate-related risks through our ERM process and align our assessment and reporting approach with the recommendations from SASB and TCFD. This approach allows us to manage our risks while evaluating our progress towards our sustainability-related goals.Carbon neutral operationsIn March 2021, we announced our ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2040 across our global operations' Scope 1 and 2 emissions and our Scope 3 contracted transportation GHG emissions. To meet this goal, we are investing more than $2 billion over the next several years to support bold action in three key areas: vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. In addition, we continue to leverage other approaches to reduce vehicle emissions, such as increased intermodal rail usage at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, which avoided nearly 600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in FY21 alone. Thanks to our ongoing collective emissions reduction efforts, we decreased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity-on a revenue basis- by 45% from FY09 through FY21, a period when our average daily package volumes grew by 180%. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in initiatives such as the successful FedEx Fuel Sense program, aircraft fleet modernization, and alternative fuels to avoid aircraft emissions.To help achieve carbon neutral operations, we have a goal to transition the entire FedEx parcel pickup and delivery (PUD) fleet to zero emission vehicles by 2040 through a phased approach. By 2025, we intend that 50% of FedEx Express PUD fleet purchases will be electric, increasing to 100% of all purchases by 2030.We are accelerating our sustainable energy plan within our facilities worldwide through energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other energy management programs. Our Energy SIT is focused on developing a strategy to achieve zero Scope 2 emissions by 2040, even though we anticipate that our facility electricity use will increase as we transition to electric vehicles.Our path toward carbon neutral operations also requires new strategies for removing and storing Earth's excess carbon. In 2021, we pledged $100 million to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture. This commitment encourages interdisciplinary research to create natural solutions for sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere. Development of these solutions falls into three major categories: biological, geological, and industrial. The Center's initial target is to help offset GHG emissions equivalent to current airline emissions-approximately one gigaton per year-through short-term, mediumterm, and ongoing research. Once these methods are proven, the Center will broaden its scope to address additional global sources of emissions to accelerate the adoption and implementation of natural carbon capture solutions around the world.In April 2021 we issued the first sustainability bond by a North American transportation and logistics company to further our commitment to carbon neutrality. Our 2021 sustainability bond framework aligned with the components of the Green Bond Principles, the Social Bond Principles, and the Sustainability Bond Guidelines, and we intend to follow these principles and guidelines for any subsequent sustainability bond offerings.Read moreFedEx Corporation, Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from FedEx Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: FedEx CorporationWebsite: http://www.fedex.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: FedEx CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/719945/Strategic-Approach-and-Climate-Change-at-FedEx]"

IT budget growth expectations ticked down to a 1.8% rate from 2.2% growth in June, when Citi ran the last survey. The increase is well shy of the 5.4% growth rate peak notched in September 2021.""We believe that the survey indicates further signs of potential weakening demand,"" Citi analyst Tyler Radke wrote.IT demand is weakening. (Citi)A more cautious tone around software demand reflects the economic headwinds hammering C-suites at the moment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) remain stuck in double-digit percentage declines for the year as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises interest rates to beat back inflation.Economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted in the first half of the year, and many Wall Street economists have pegged the U.S. to enter recession by early 2023 if it isn't already in one currently.A stronger U.S. dollar, meanwhile, has weighed on market sentiment and the top and bottom lines of multinationals, causing many to rethink their investment plants.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Stubbornly high supply chain costs are also doing no favors for corporate budgets.In turn, software stocks — once a market darling fetching major valuation premiums — have been shredded this year amid the dimming outlook for growth.

New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”Story continuesbackground, brand, branding, business, buy, camera, candidate, collage, collection, commercial, communication, editorial, global, icons, illustrative, information, international, internet, like, logo, logotype, marketing, media, name, network, networking, new, news, newspaper, pattern, photo, popular, sale, salesforce, service, set, sign, social, sold, symbol, thumb, up, web, website, white, worldCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock PhotoSalesforce, Inc.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Factors Affecting FlowserveFlowserve is experiencing weakness in its original equipment business due to supply-chain challenges, logistics problems and labor issues. In the second quarter of 2022, its original equipment sales were down 5.8% year over year. In the quarter, its adjusted operating margin also declined 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis. These adversities may dampen FLS’ performance in the near term.FLS’ high-debt profile raises a concern. Its long-term debt was high at $1,241.6 million at the end of second-quarter 2022. Fresh issuances of debt instruments in the near term might inflate Flowserve’s financial obligations and hurt profitability.Though Flowserve’s realignment plans are likely to provide benefits in the long run, the same is fuelling its expenses and adversely impacting its profitability. FLS’ net income might be affected by realignment expenses in the coming quarters. It expects to incur realignment expenses of $10 million in 2022. The bottom line might be hurt by incremental expenses in the quarters ahead.Given its widespread presence in the international markets, FLS is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. For instance, in second-quarter 2022, foreign exchange headwinds adversely impacted its sales by $41 million. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress FLS’ overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Flowserve Corporation Price and ConsensusFlowserve Corporation Price and ConsensusFlowserve Corporation price-consensus-chart | Flowserve Corporation QuoteIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has been revised 10.5% downward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Enerpac Tool Group Corp.

64,546d098e-202f-3a03-b652-04e01e96cfc4,NWS,2022-10-13,Realtor.com® September Rental Report: National Rent Growth Cools to the Slowest Annual Pace in 16 Months,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-september-rental-report-100000968.html,1665655200.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In September, the U.S. median rental price ($1,759) posted its smallest year-over-year increase (+7.8%) since last summer and further declined from its July 2022 peak (-$22)SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- September data confirms a fall cooldown has come to the rental market, as national rent growth dropped to its lowest annual pace (+7.8%) since June 2021, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Rental Report released today. In another sign of more typical seasonal moderation than last year, the U.S. median rental price posted its second month-over-month decline in eight months in September, further slipping from its July peak.""After more than a year of double-digit yearly rent gains and nearly as many months of record-high rents, it's especially important to see consistency before we confirm a major shift like the recent rental market cooldown. But September data provides that evidence, as national rents continued to pull back from their latest all-time high registered just two months ago,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""This return of more seasonal norms indicates that rental markets are charting a path back toward a more typical balance between supply and demand, compared to the previous year. We expect rent growth to keep slowing in the months ahead, partly driven by the impact of inflation on renters' budgets. However, it's unlikely that rents will return to a more normal pre-COVID pace of growth for at least another year, when available rental inventory starts to reflect the recent uptick in multifamily new construction.""September 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange over Sept. 2021Change over Sept. 2020Overall$1,7597.8 %22.8 %Studio$1,48310.1 %22.8 %1-bed$1,6477.7 %23.0 %2-bed$1,9416.4 %22.4 %National rent cooldown continues, offering renters relief from rising prices September marked the second straight month of consistent moderation in national rents, in terms of both the annual growth rate remaining in single-digit territory and continued month-over-month price declines. These trends are mirroring the earlier shift in for-sale housing, suggesting that the rental market is following similar patterns of more typical seasonal cooling as part of the real estate refresh from the 2021 frenzy. However, like this year's homebuyers, renters are still facing significantly higher housing costs than in prior years, with national rents for all unit sizes at more than 1.2 times their 2020 levels in September. As a result, rental affordability remains a significant challenge, especially as inflation continues to outpace wage growth.Story continuesFor the second month in a row, the U.S. median rental price for 0-2 bedroom units ($1,759) grew at a single-digit year-over-year pace (+7.8%) and dropped on a month-over-month basis, bringing total declines in September over July's peak to $22.Although yearly rent growth moderated to its slowest annual pace since June 2021 (+8.5%), it remained more than two-times faster than the yearly rate in March 2020 (+3.3%) at the onset of COVID. Additionally, national rents were 24.8% higher in September compared to the same month in 2019.Rent growth for larger units also cooled in September, with two-bedroom ($1,941) and one-bedroom ($1,647) median rental prices both rising at a single-digit year-over-year pace for the second month in a row, up 6.4% and 7.7% respectively.Despite outpacing larger unit rents in September, studio rental prices followed a similar pattern of deceleration in September, dropping $15 from the July peak to a median of $1,483. However, studios were the only unit size to maintain a double-digit annual growth pace in rents, up 10.1% (+$136) from September 2021.Sun Belt rental markets moderate; big tech city rents keep climbing Just as September's national rental trends reflected a shift toward relatively normal patterns, local rental markets showed a return to more typical activity. On the one hand, many Sun Belt metros showed substantial signs of yearly rental growth moderation in September, a marked reversal from the area's dramatic rent increases during the pandemic. On the other hand, urban rents are making up for lost time from their COVID slowdown as more Americans once again embrace downtown offices and lifestyles. In fact, big tech cities were among the only large markets to post double-digit annual rent gains in September.In September, rental prices grew at a double-digit annual pace in just eight large metros, including many of the nation's major tech cities. In rank order, the biggest rent gains year-over-year were registered in: Chicago (+23.9%), Boston (+19.9%), New York (18.2%), Providence, R.I. (+16.7%), Oklahoma City (+13.8%), Miami (+13.2%), Kansas City, Mo. (+11.2%) and San Jose, Calif. (+10.7%).Relative to those eight cities, September rent increases were smaller in more than three-quarters of the biggest markets, including many in the Sun Belt area. For example, rents increased by single-digits year-over-year in Dallas (8.8%), San Diego (8.4%), and Orlando, FL (8.3%), each for the first time in at least 15 months.Additionally, four markets posted annual rental price declines in September: Riverside, Calif. (-1.0%), Tampa, Fla. (-0.3%), Las Vegas (-0.2%), and Sacramento, Calif. (-0.1%). In each of these metros, September marked their first yearly drop in rents since the onset of the pandemic.At the same time, compared to three years ago, September rental prices were higher in all 50 of the largest metros, and up by double-digits in 48 markets. Even with their recent rental moderation, Sun Belt metros still top the list of biggest rent gains over September 2019 levels: Miami (+51.8%), Tampa (+40.9%) and Memphis, Tenn. (+37.5%).""Realtor.com®'s September data highlights the true extent of the rental market boom that has taken place over the past three years, and underscores the prevalence of rental affordability challenges faced by many Americans today. Recent surveys we've conducted at Avail also show that higher housing costs are a significant financial strain for many renters and landlords, at a time when inflation is driving up prices across the board,"" said Ryan Coon, VP of Rentals at Realtor.com® and Co-Founder of Avail (part of Realtor.com®). ""In some good news for renters – and further evidence that the rental cooldown will continue – many surveyed landlords indicate that they are adjusting their pricing strategies to account for tenants' tighter budgets.""September 2022 Rental Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetroOverall Median RentOverall Rent YYStudio Median RentStudio Rent YY1-br Median Rent1-br Rent YY2-br Median Rent2-br Rent YYAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,7492.4 %$1,7117.5 %$1,6482.2 %$1,9081.9 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,7255.3 %$1,45010.3 %$1,5703.2 %$1,9064.4 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,7794.7 %$1,5775.5 %$1,6954.9 %$1,9075.6 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,1816.6 %$948-10.2 %$1,1144.5 %$1,2548.3 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,99619.9 %$2,78327.3 %$2,78516.4 %$3,34321.4 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,2766.8 %$8482.7 %$1,19912.1 %$1,5008.3 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,6326.3 %$1,57212.2 %$1,5126.7 %$1,7745.5 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$2,04523.9 %$1,74651.8 %$2,01726.1 %$2,24218.0 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind.$1,3039.3 %$1,1849.6 %$1,2308.2 %$1,3516.5 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,2439.8 %$89511.9 %$1,1809.8 %$1,34910.1 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2939.5 %$1,0919.2 %$1,2209.5 %$1,3556.1 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,5968.8 %$1,40911.0 %$1,4799.4 %$1,8907.9 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,9664.1 %$1,6574.2 %$1,8343.6 %$2,2623.8 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3088.4 %$1,14114.7 %$1,16611.3 %$1,4466.3 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,6899.6 %$1,2765.7 %$1,5236.8 %$1,8214.7 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,3765.7 %$1,3375.0 %$1,2705.8 %$1,5324.7 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,2638.5 %$1,12612.3 %$1,19310.7 %$1,3382.9 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,4904.0 %$1,42431.1 %$1,4093.9 %$1,5931.3 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,30811.2 %$9957.9 %$1,21410.8 %$1,50110.8 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,531-0.2 %$99210.2 %$1,408-0.6 %$1,631-3.0 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,9398.0 %$2,34611.8 %$2,7116.8 %$3,4186.4 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,1319.6 %$97910.3 %$1,0567.6 %$1,2467.9 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,3016.4 %$1,1999.0 %$1,2927.6 %$1,2881.0 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,59013.2 %$2,29219.1 %$2,31413.3 %$2,88810.8 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5257.6 %$1,2079.8 %$1,4238.5 %$1,7113.2 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5593.6 %$1,2181.5 %$1,4662.5 %$1,8732.3 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,7108.8 %$1,6254.3 %$1,6368.1 %$1,7549.1 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,3191.5 %NA*New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,83818.2 %$2,61221.5 %$2,52313.0 %$3,12414.2 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$96113.8 %$81917.0 %$89318.3 %$1,00912.7 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,7908.3 %$1,5838.9 %$1,6929.2 %$2,0018.0 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-M.D.$1,7416.1 %$1,44214.0 %$1,6745.4 %$1,8852.6 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,6380.2 %$1,2921.4 %$1,5371.1 %$1,776-1.9 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,5137.7 %$1,35910.9 %$1,4777.4 %$1,5983.6 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,8337.2 %$1,4705.0 %$1,7646.4 %$2,0435.9 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.$2,04316.7 %NA*Raleigh, N.C.$1,6117.4 %$1,51510.1 %$1,5078.3 %$1,7918.0 %Richmond, Va.$1,4068.3 %$1,26516.3 %$1,32612.9 %$1,5547.1 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,112-1.0 %$1,179-19.9 %$1,884-0.6 %$2,4210.0 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,3018.7 %$1,04118.9 %$1,21110.4 %$1,48712.2 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,921-0.1 %$1,683-2.5 %$1,791-0.5 %$2,0480.6 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2937.5 %$1,0642.7 %$1,2197.7 %$1,4716.3 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,8688.4 %$2,2937.8 %$2,6686.9 %$3,1346.7 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$3,1268.1 %$2,65110.9 %$2,8405.0 %$3,5666.1 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,33310.7 %$2,69510.2 %$3,10611.6 %$3,7239.7 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,1874.7 %$1,8178.5 %$2,1583.2 %$2,5125.7 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,2155.9 %$9733.3 %$1,1695.3 %$1,2855.3 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,755-0.3 %$1,6071.3 %$1,6691.1 %$1,888-3.1 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4154.3 %$1,36419.1 %$1,3834.8 %$1,421-2.0 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-Va.-Md.-W.

Together, the companies are expanding functionality in the Microsoft Seeing AI app to provide consumers with more detailed labelling information for over 1,500 Haleon products across the U.S. and U.K. Seeing AI is a free mobile app designed to help people who have trouble seeing by narrating the world around them. Microsoft Seeing AI app scans Sensodyne barcode for health information.With today's launch on World Sight Day, people will hear packaging information through Seeing AI by scanning the barcode of Haleon products. This will provide an audio read-out of important information, such as product name, ingredients and usage instructions. Through Seeing AI's enhanced functionality, Haleon will help empower people to care for their own health independently by listening to label information narrated through the Seeing AI application.Haleon's inaugural Health Inclusivity Index, which sets a new global standard for measuring health inclusivity, makes clear that to improve health inclusivity, individuals and communities need to be provided with the power and the tools to truly take their health into their own hands. Haleon, driven by its purpose to deliver better everyday health with humanity, is committed to helping make healthcare more achievable, inclusive and sustainable. The Seeing AI collaboration with Microsoft is one of Haleon's first new initiatives to champion health inclusivity. The Microsoft Seeing AI app can be a benefit to:Story continuesThe 1 million Americans who live with blindness (CDC, ""Fast Facts of Common Eye Disorders, https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm)The 12 million U.S. adults over the age of 40 who are blind or have low vision (CDC, ""Fast Facts of Common Eye Disorders, https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm)The Seeing AI app was developed by a team of Microsoft engineers spearheaded by project lead and engineering manager Saqib Shaikh, who lost his sight at the age of seven and was driven to develop the app by his passion for using technology to improve people's lives.Saqib Shaikh, engineering manager at Microsoft, said: ""I'm really excited to see the launch of this enhanced product recognition functionality, developed in collaboration with Haleon. Seeing AI's intelligent barcode scanner plays audio cues to help you find the barcode, and now the information displayed for Haleon products is coming straight from the manufacturer, providing richer information including usage instructions and ingredients. This can be invaluable for someone who cannot read the label, leading to greater independence.""Katie Williams, U.S. chief marketing officer at Haleon said, ""We believe everyone should have access to self-care products, services and the information needed to make informed, proactive choices about their health needs. Haleon initiated this collaboration with Microsoft via its Seeing AI app to make consumer health more accessible, achievable and inclusive. We are proud to help make better everyday health more in reach for the blind and those with low vision.""The Seeing AI app is free to download from the Apple App Store and will be available on Android in the future. To use Seeing AI on Haleon's products, users should hold their phone camera over the packaging barcode. The app will read out the product name and all text on the package. Users can skip ahead or move back to the relevant section they want to listen to, for example, which flavor or how to use the product. The Haleon barcode functionality will launch today in the U.S. and U.K. first, with plans to expand globally and add additional languages in the future.About Haleon U.S.Haleon (NYSE: HLN) is a leading global consumer health company with a portfolio of brands trusted daily by millions of people.

Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, joins us, along with Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley, to break it all down. So thank you for joining us.I want to first get your instincts here. Obviously, a very crowded market. People like to get excited about new products. What were the standout products for Microsoft so far?YUSUF MEHDI: Well, today, there's really a couple of big things. One is the next major update to Windows 11, which really makes a lot of improvements in accessibility and security and productivity for people as well as better gaming. And then a number of updates with our new devices on our Surface line, sort of a new Surface Laptop 5 and the Surface Pro 9, both of which are 50% faster than their predecessors. They're amazing for hybrid work and learning. And the Pro 9 has new capabilities that let you take advantage of the cloud and AI to do some incredible creativity that you haven't been able to do before.DAN HOWLEY: Yusuf, this is Dan. I just want to get a sense of who you think the customers are for these types of devices really? You have the hybrid Pro 9. You have the laptop. You have the studio. I think you have some adaptive technology there. Who's really the audience here?YUSUF MEHDI: Yeah, good question, Dan. It's a pretty broad audience. So if we start with-- let's start with the two most mainstream products. We have the Surface Pro 9, which is a two-in-one. It's our tablet that can replace a laptop. It's designed for the mobile professional that likes to move around or the person who's running from the house, running the home and moving around. It's a laptop and a keyboard, it's a great device.Story continuesWe also have the Laptop 5, which is essentially similar class but more of a laptop form factor. Again, great for businesses, business professionals, but also great for students, and great for people in the home. Those are our mainstream devices. They start at $999. And they go up from there.Then we have a very high-end, probably our best creativity device. It's the Surface Studio 2 Plus. It's designed for creators, professionals, programmers, designers, graphic designers in enterprise. That's a more expensive device obviously, but it is the absolute best creation device. And then finally, as you mentioned, we introduced a number of great accessories for people with disabilities. One in five people in the US deal with some form of disability. And these devices let you use your surface devices in a much easier form.DAN HOWLEY: I guess, where are you seeing most people use their computers now? You know, we're kind of in the hybrid work world at this point. It seems like it's staying that way. Where are they really sticking to? Is that games, chat, what is it?YUSUF MEHDI: Sorry, what was the last part you said, Dan?DAN HOWLEY: Is it games, chat, or work? How are they kind of using this?YUSUF MEHDI: Yeah. So they're-- so they're using them for quite a variety of things. So for people at work, they're using their laptops for obviously remote work. They're doing video conference calling. We've seen 300 million more apps use like Discord, Slack, Teams. WeChat is now used in a very robust way from home. Also, of course, for creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices.And then a lot of gaming, a lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming still at an all-time high. So we see a lot of that. In home use, we see people doing things like telehealth. They're doing online shopping from home. They're doing communications and connecting with family and friends. So they're doing a variety of tasks. As a whole, what we've seen over the last few years, use of Windows PCs and Windows 11 is up significantly. It's up 10% total minutes per device. We see 20% more people using Windows PCs than in the past. And that's because the relevancy of the PC in our lives has probably never been greater.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Yusuf, though, we are seeing a slowdown overall and what we're seeing with PC demand, how is Microsoft navigating this space? And what does the next generation of the PC look like?YUSUF MEHDI: Yeah. It's a great question. You're right, we're in a tough macro environment. So it's very hard these days, whether it's interest rates up or the war in Europe and the like. A big part of what's good about the PC is it is really the best value for your money if you're buying an electronics device. And a big part of that is, you know, as I was just talking about, usage is up. That's the proof in there.Where we see things going is we see continued new use cases opening up on the PC. Like I mentioned, they're being used now in a way that they weren't before for video conferencing because of the remote work. We're seeing, like I said, online shopping quite a bit. I saw recently that you were just talking a little bit about how new generation likes to shop in person. But broadly, people want to shop at home. And we've seen a huge amount of that.We offer a Coupon feature in Edge now. We've saved over $1.4 billion for people with coupons. The average person can save $400 when shopping online using Microsoft Edge browser. So I think we're going to continue to see some of these new use cases open up, for shopping, for health, for gaming, for creation. And I think that will continue.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. Well, a big thank you for joining us this afternoon. Yusuf Mehdi and our very own Dan Howley, thank you both.]"

Sturdy gains from growth initiatives like unique banner value propositions, marketing efforts and advanced connected-commerce capabilities are also aiding its performance. SIG’s innovation efforts also bode well. Buoyed by the aforesaid endeavors, shares of this jewelry retailer have gained 6% in the past three months against the industry’s 5.7% decline.Let’s Delve DeeperDigital business is the key driver for Signet. Management is focused on enhancing the data-analytics capabilities with higher precision. SIG is leveraging the analytics capability to optimize the process of adding product assortments. In addition, e-tags are innovative and come across as a valuable technology. Signet currently has 28,000 e-tags tracking loose diamonds at the store level.Signet has been integrating its physical stores with advanced virtual experiences through data-driven in-store consultations and services like buy online pickup in-store and curbside options.

SIG’s connected commerce strategy helps enhance customer experiences, and leverage in-store and online capabilities as well as mobile and ubiquitous delivery.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSIG had earlier added several features and capabilities to its digital platform, offering a seamless customer experience. It had rolled out Google Business Messages and Apple Business Chat features, allowing customers to engage virtual jewelry consultants in real time or offline from search results or maps. All the aforesaid efforts indicate that Signet continues focusing on evolving its channel-agnostic retailer capabilities. We expect the momentum in SIG’s digital business to continue driving the overall results ahead.Management is also steadily enhancing its service offerings to widen customer relationships. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, 65% more appointments were booked online from the last year’s level. Also, the average transaction value is 30% higher. Signet also expanded the virtual try-on option for more of its major products, boosting conversion rates between three and six-fold.In the reported quarter, above 20% customers used one or more of its flexible fulfillment options, including ship to and from store, buy online, pick up in store or same-day delivery. All these improved customer convenience and inventory efficiency.We note that Signet’s Inspiring Brilliance strategy bodes well. This growth move focuses on expanding big banners, boosting services, broadening the Accessible Luxury and Value segments, and accelerating digital commerce. As part of the strategy, SIG uses data-driven insights to target new and existing customers.Signet’s buyout of Diamonds Direct, known for unique bridal-focused collections, appears encouraging.

Our execution to date provides us visibility and confidence to increase the long-term outlook for our next growth engine and reconfirm our path to low-teens adjusted EPS growth. Our strategic actions are unlocking sustainable shareholder value as we simplify the company and continue our journey to being a healthcare leader.""Story continuesOverview of Fourth Quarter ResultsWBA fourth quarter sales from continuing operations decreased 5.3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $32.4 billion, a decrease of 3.2 percent on a constant currency basis. Sales growth at Walgreens and in the International segment, and sales contributions from the U.S. Healthcare segment were more than offset by a 660 basis point impact from the sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens.Fourth quarter operating loss from continuing operations was $822 million compared to operating income of $910 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating loss in the quarter reflects a $783 million non-cash impairment charge related to intangible assets in Boots UK, and higher costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations was $744 million, a decrease of 38.2 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower U.S. pharmacy operating results as it lapped higher volumes of prior year COVID-19 vaccinations, and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare, partly offset by improved retail contributions in both the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments.Net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $415 million compared to net income of $358 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the decline in operating income, which was partly offset by the favorable impact of a lower tax rate, and a gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's equity method investment in Option Care Health. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased 31.9 percent to $694 million, down 30.2 percent on a constant currency basis compared with the year-ago quarter.Loss per share from continuing operations was $0.48, compared to earnings per share of $0.41 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 31.8 percent to $0.80, reflecting a decrease of 30.0 percent on a constant currency basis.Net cash provided by operating activities was $85 million in the fourth quarter and free cash flow was $(407) million, a $1.3 billion decrease compared with the year-ago quarter driven primarily by lower operating income, pre-buy of seasonal inventory, U.S. legal settlements, and increased capital expenditures in growth initiatives, partly offset by working capital timing benefits.Overview of Fiscal Year ResultsSales from continuing operations in fiscal 2022 increased 0.1 percent from the year-ago period to $132.7 billion, up 1.2 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting comparable sales growth at Walgreens and in the International segment as well as contributions from U.S. Healthcare acquisitions, partly offset by a 550 basis point impact from the sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens.Operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2022 decreased 40.8 percent to $1.4 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the year-ago period. This reflects a $783 million Boots UK impairment charge, a $683 million charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida, and higher Transformational Cost Management program costs, partly offset by a $1.5 billion charge in the prior fiscal year related to the Company's equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations increased 0.3 percent on a reported basis to $5.1 billion, up 1.2 percent on a constant currency basis. The increase reflects improved retail contribution in the U.S., and a continued rebound in International sales and profitability, partly offset by a decrease in U.S. pharmacy operating results, and by growth investments in U.S. Healthcare.Net earnings from continuing operations were $4.3 billion in fiscal 2022, compared with $2.0 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting a $2.5 billion after-tax gain in the first quarter due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held investments in VillageMD and Shields Health Solutions, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, in the prior fiscal year from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. This was partly offset by impairment charges in Boots UK in the fourth quarter, and the charge related to the Florida opioid settlement in the third quarter.

The ""United States"" segment has been renamed to ""U.S. Retail Pharmacy"" and the ""Walgreens Health"" segment was renamed to ""U.S. Healthcare"". The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments.U.S. Retail PharmacyThe U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had fourth quarter sales of $26.7 billion, a decrease of 7.2 percent from the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales increased 1.6 percent from the year-ago quarter and lapped strong comparable sales of 8.1 percent in the year-ago quarter, which included a significant contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations.Pharmacy sales decreased 8.8 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by a 10 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Comparable prescriptions filled in the fourth quarter decreased 3.5 percent while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations decreased 0.1 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 4.4 percent to 298.7 million.Retail sales decreased 2.4 percent and comparable retail sales decreased 1.9 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Excluding tobacco, comparable retail sales decreased 1.1 percent. Comparable retail sales lapped strong results in the year ago quarter where comparable retail sales increased 6.2 percent, aided by broad based growth across all categories including strong sales of COVID-19 related items. Over a three-year period, comparable retail sales excluding tobacco increased 13.0 percent.Gross profit decreased 15.3 percent to $5.3 billion compared to $6.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross profit decreased 13.2 percent to $5.4 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting a decline in pharmacy results from lower COVID-19 vaccinations and continued reimbursement pressure, partly offset by retail gross margin performance.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) decreased 3.2 percent to $5.2 billion compared to $5.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A decreased 6.8 percent to $4.8 billion, driven by lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and cost discipline, partly offset by increased labor costs and the timing of marketing expenditures.Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased 75.2 percent to $251 million compared to operating income of $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher costs related to the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted operating income decreased 36.1 percent to $786 million compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes and continued reimbursement pressure, partly offset by improved retail gross margin and SG&amp;A expense improvement.InternationalThe International segment had fourth quarter sales of $5.1 billion, a decrease of 6.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, including an adverse currency impact of 13.3 percent. Sales increased 6.7 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK sales growing 6.0 percent, and the Company's German wholesale business growing 6.8 percent.Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales decreased 6.9 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, largely due to lower demand for COVID-19 services compared to the year-ago quarter. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 15.2 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, with notable market share gains in Personal Care and Health and Wellness. Footfall improved around 20 percent, compared to the year-ago quarter. Boots.com continued to perform well, accounting for 11 percent of retail sales in the quarter compared to 6 percent pre-pandemic.Gross profit decreased 7.3 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, including an adverse currency impact of 12.7 percent. Adjusted gross profit increased 5.4 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong sales growth across all International markets, partially offset by lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK compared to the year-ago quarter and timing of National Health Service (NHS) reimbursement.SG&amp;A in the quarter increased 54.7 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.8 billion, due to impairment charges in Boots UK. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased 1.9 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting increased in store activity and absence of COVID-19 related government support compared with the year-ago quarter.Operating loss in the fourth quarter was $672 million compared to operating income of $46 million in the year-ago quarter, as a result of the $783 million impairment charges in Boots UK. Adjusted operating income grew to $163 million, an increase of 31.3 percent on a constant currency basis.U.S. HealthcareThe U.S. Healthcare segment had fourth quarter sales of $622 million. On a pro forma basis, this segment's businesses grew sales at a combined rate of 34 percent in the quarter. Shields grew 48 percent, driven by key contract wins, further expansion of existing partnerships, and strong executional focus. VillageMD grew 31 percent, reflecting existing clinic growth and clinic footprint expansion.Gross profit was a loss of $37 million and adjusted gross profit was a loss of $9 million. Shields gross profit, driven by further growth of existing partnerships and expanding margins, was more than offset by VillageMD expansion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, VillageMD had 334 total clinics open, an increase of 82 clinics compared to the year-ago quarter.Fourth quarter SG&amp;A was $301 million, and adjusted SG&amp;A was $143 million, reflecting the two acquisitions, as well as continued investments in the Walgreens Health organic business.Operating loss was $338 million. Adjusted operating loss was $151 million. Adjusted operating loss excludes certain costs related to stock compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets.Fiscal 2023 Outlook and Long-Term Growth OutlookFor the full fiscal year 2023, Walgreens Boots Alliance expects adjusted EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Healthy core business growth of 8 to 10 percent in constant currency is expected to be more than offset by adverse currency movements of approximately 2 percent and by a headwind of 15 to 17 percent from lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes.Additionally, the Company is raising the U.S. Healthcare fiscal year 2025 sales target to $11 billion to $12 billion, from $9 billion to $10 billion previously. The segment is expected to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by fiscal year 2024. The Company reconfirmed its expectation to achieve low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2025.Management will provide additional details during the earnings call presentation.Conference CallWBA will hold an extended conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 earnings results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, Oct. 13, 2022.

AND SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(in millions, except per share amounts)The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Constant currencyThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in ""constant currency,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Comparable salesFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Company's method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.With respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in ""Constant currency"" for further details on constant currency calculations.Key Performance IndicatorsThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of co-located VillageMD clinics and number of total VillageMD clinics, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.With respect to the total number of VillageMD clinics, clinics are defined as the primary care locations where the Company or the Company’s affiliates lease or license space and the providers are employed by either the Company or one of the Company’s affiliates. These clinics are primarily branded as Village Medical where the Company employs the providers but, in some instances, may operate under their own brands.NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE(in millions)Three months endedAugust 31,Twelve months endedAugust 31,2022202120222021Net (loss) earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. - continuing operations (GAAP)$(415)$358$4,337$1,994Adjustments to operating income:Adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen 163702181,645Acquisition-related amortization 2239156855523Transformational cost management 330579763417Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements 43415768...]"

Workers will get more funds to pursue coursework, and employees in some states will be able to access new health plan benefits, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the program hasn’t been announced publicly.It’s part of a broader effort to reward workers at the Cupertino, California-based company, which has had to navigate inflationary pressure, a tight labor market and changing demands of workers during the pandemic. But the company was quick to inform the employees at its unionized retail location -- a store in the Baltimore suburb of Towson, Maryland -- that they wouldn’t get the new perks.The reason given was that the Towson store needs to negotiate benefits with Apple via the collective bargaining arrangement that comes with a union. The approach isn’t unique to Apple. Excluding unionized stores from new benefits has also been a flashpoint in the labor dispute at Starbucks Corp., where about 250 cafes have voted to unionize over the past year. Starbucks rolled out a series of new perks at nonunion stores, including raises and student-debt coaching, while saying that it can’t legally provide them unilaterally to sites with union activity.Apple’s move could dissuade employees in other cities from unionizing their stores, but it also could further upset workers. The company declined to comment.Story continuesEmployees at an Apple store in Oklahoma City are due to vote this week whether to join the Communications Workers of America, and labor groups are looking to mobilize workers at more of the company’s US stores in the coming months. The iPhone maker also has contended with some employee pushback in its office staff, which was ordered back to in-person work in recent months.The new benefits include:Apple prepaying some tuition for outside education. The company has long reimbursed employees for a portion of education costs, but the iPhone maker will now pay the amount in advance. This will start at a small amount of colleges, though the list is expected to expand over time.A program with Coursera Inc. beginning on Jan. 1 that gives Apple employees a free membership. Coursera is an online-course provider that normally charges $399 per year for its premium subscription.In certain states, including Connecticut, New York, Georgia, Washington and New Jersey, employees will get access to a new health care plan that waives co-pays for some Apple-approved doctors within the UnitedHealth Group Inc. network.Apple’s behavior could be deemed by the National Labor Relations Board to violate federal law, which forbids anti-union threats or discrimination, labor experts said. The timing of the new benefits could be particularly significant, since it comes on the eve of the Oklahoma City election.“It’s hard to see how they could come up with a legitimate reason for the timing other than to influence the outcome of the election,” former union attorney and NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman said in an email.Apple has expanded other benefits for workers over the past year. The company previously upped vacation and sick days, and it has long-offered health care and product discounts.The store in Maryland, which is represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, is preparing to begin formal negotiations with Apple. Its labor group in recent days supplied employees with guides to negotiate with Apple and hold conversations with managers.According to an internal survey provided with the guide that was obtained by Bloomberg News, the No. 1 bargaining priority at that location is general wage increases, followed by cost-of-living adjustments, improved work-life balance, better communication and more staffing.The union said Wednesday that it remained committed to negotiations at the Maryland store.“Our goal is still the same,” the IAM union said in a statement. “We are urging Apple to negotiate in good faith so we can reach an agreement over the next few weeks.”Apple’s union-related moves have been under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks, with the NLRB and CWA accusing the iPhone maker of discriminating against pro-union employees.In the Starbucks case, the union said it waived the right to negotiate over receiving perks that were already being provided to other stores -- meaning employees should just get them automatically. Workers United, the group attempting to organize Starbucks cafes, described the denial of benefits as a union-busting tactic.While it is true that the law restricts companies from making unilateral changes at unionized shops, nothing prohibits management from offering to give union workers the same new perks that other staff are getting, said Harvard Law School professor Benjamin Sachs.That’s true even if there isn’t yet an overall collective bargaining agreement yet, he said. “They can’t impose the increases, but they can offer them to the union,” Sachs said.“If you give benefit increases to nonunion workers and withhold them from union workers, you’re sending a message of favoritism and discrimination,” he said. “You’re trying to discourage workers from forming unions.”(Updates with commentary from labor experts starting in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketHow Gamers Beat NFTsExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look Like©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

It's Delta Airlines and Starbucks. You got to love coffee when you're flying. What's the common thread here, though? Beyond that, the two are linking their loyalty programs in order to boost sales. Starting today, once you connect the accounts, Delta SkyMiles members can earn one mile for each dollar spent at Starbucks. Members will also earn double stars on Starbucks rewards when making purchases at participating Starbucks on days when flying Delta. I know that sounds confusing. Check your email if you're a member of either. They've already emailed you.Through the end of the year, SkyMiles members can earn 500 miles if they link accounts, earn another 150 in stars once they make a qualifying purchase. This adds to existing Delta rewards relationships already with Lyft, Airbnb, and Instacart. Delta stock is up just over-- let's see-- it was just over 1%, down 27%, though, year to date. Starbucks is up as well 1%, and down 25% year to date.Interesting partnership, although speaking of coffee loyalty stories, a big story this week, Rachelle, has been Dunkin' members are furious at their changes, making it harder to get a free cup of coffee. And they say they're going to Starbucks. I don't believe it.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, there's a pretty significant price difference between what you pay at Dunkin' and Starbucks. I don't know how long--DAVE BRIGGS: Taste difference, too.RACHELLE AKUFFO: --the outrage is going to last when you start looking at your wallet. Exactly. But as you were mentioning these partnerships that Delta has, we saw from Prashant Sharma, vice president of loyalty at Delta, they've really been trying to evolve the premium experience. And they say that they want to really capture that, whether you're flying with them or not. So clearly having that overlap that Delta customers get to enjoy that premium experience. So do Starbucks consumers. I like this fusion. I think this is good. What do you think, Seana?Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, I don't think there's anything not to like about it. I'm a little confused just in terms of how are you going to prove that you're flying on Delta, how exactly this all works. So I think we're all going to have to check the fine print of this. But this partnership, of course, makes a lot of sense. And this is coming in terms of, as we approach a potential worsening economic slowdown, consumer facing brands facing a pretty rocky couple of months-- that's what we expect, at least. So a partnership like this certainly does not help, Dave.You listed the partners that Delta has already had locked in here so far. It makes a lot of sense. I hope a similar partnership is coming to United. I don't fly Delta that often. But I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think flyers of Delta and Starbucks drinkers are going to be very excited about this one.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm just wondering which of the airlines is going to partner up with a streamer. That's got to happen in the next couple of years. Just going to put that out there.]"

Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those looking to build up a cash pile, let’s dive deeper into each one.Archer Daniels MidlandArcher Daniels Midland is a leading producer of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.The company’s annual dividend yield comes in at 1.9%. In addition, ADM pays out just 25% of earnings and carries a rock-solid 4.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher Daniels Midland has an impressive earnings track record, exceeding revenue and earnings estimates in each of its last seven quarters.Just in its latest print, ADM penciled in a double-digit 23% EPS beat paired with an 8% revenue beat. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, ADM shares are reasonably priced; the company’s 12.6X forward earnings multiple is notably below its 14.3X five-year median and represents a sizable 32% discount relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples sector.Story continuesThe company sports a Style Score of an A for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsolidated EdisonConsolidated Edison is a diversified utility holding company with subsidiaries engaged in both regulated and unregulated businesses.ED’s annual dividend yield comes in at a steep 3.9%, nicely above that of its Zacks Utilities sector average.Further, the company pays out 70% of its earnings and carries a 2.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsolidated Edison also carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings estimates suggesting Y/Y bottom-line growth of 2% and 7.4% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.The company’s top line is also in solid standing; revenue is forecasted to increase by a solid 7.4% in FY22 and a further 3.7% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’sMcDonald’s is a long-time leading fast-food chain that nearly anybody could recognize, with its signature golden arches sitting at every corner.McDonald’s rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend that yields 2.3%, notably higher than its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average of 1.1%.Further, the company has been dedicated to growing its dividend, carrying a robust 7.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike ED, McDonald’s sports a solid growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 5.7% in FY22 and a further 7.1% in FY23.The company’s top line looks to take a hit in FY22, with the Zacks Consensus Sales estimate of $22.7 billion reflecting a 2.3% drop from FY21 sales of $23.2 billion.Still, things kick back into the green in FY23, with estimates calling for 3.6% Y/Y revenue growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMCD shares trade at a 24.1X forward earnings multiple, undoubtedly creeping into the higher side of the spectrum.

C&amp;R Technologies offers a thermal-centric modeling approach that provides quick and effective system-level simulation capabilities. These, when combined with ANSYS’ physical solvers, will provide customers with enhanced fidelity through every stage of thermal system design and optimization for a variety of applications.C&amp;R Technologies portfolio of solutions is complementary to ANSYS’ suite of 3D thermal, fluid flow, and mission simulation tools. Together, these solutions will provide customers with an effective design, and analysis, as well as optimization of the thermal behavior of systems and networks of interacting components, added ANSYS.     Both companies currently have a partnership in place whereby users can integrate C&amp;R Technologies’ Thermal Desktop's system-level thermal modeling with ANSYS’ multiphysics analysis software solutions (like structures, fluids, space, and optical simulation portfolios).ANSYS, Inc.

The company offers simulation solutions for developing next-generation 5G product designs, autonomous vehicles, thinner and more reliable mobile and Internet of Things products as well as high-performance chips for advanced driver assistance systems.The company’s robust product portfolio and cross-domain offering will continue to drive its customer base.

With the OnScale integration, ANSYS will be able to offer its clients (ranging from enterprise customers to start-ups) a cloud-native, web-based user interface for “device-independent access” to the company’s wide-ranging simulation solutions and technologies.

The way airline stocks have been acting, you’d think the industry fully participated in the stimulus juiced lockdown party.

HCA is planning to divest three Louisiana hospitals for $150 million to LCMC Health, per reports.

The deal is expected to close by 2022-end or early 2023. The acquirer is expected to work together with Tulane University to enhance academic medicine and research scope. The divestment of three hospitals will likely leave HCA Healthcare with one facility in Louisiana.In a somewhat similar move, more than a year ago, HCA divested all its Atlanta hospitals for over $1.5 billion. It has four remaining hospitals in Georgia’s eastern and southern parts. Business streamlining plays a major role in HCA Healthcare’s operations, which boosts profitability by divesting less profitable assets and acquiring more efficient ones.The company’s inorganic growth strategies have led to an increase in patient volumes, enabled network expansion across several markets and added hospitals to its portfolio.

PPG said that it expects its adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2022 to be 5-7% below the bottom end of its guidance range of $1.75-$2.00 that was earlier announced in July.The Pittsburgh-based paint giant noted that its sales were impacted by the further weakening of demand in Europe in comparison with its forecast at the beginning of the third quarter.  Demand recovery in China was also lower than expected on a sequential comparison basis due to the resumption of certain pandemic-related restrictions.The declines in sales volume were most pronounced in September, leading to a reduction in the earnings benefit from increased selling prices and lower manufacturing efficiencies versus the earlier forecast, the company noted.PPG Industries envisions weaker demand conditions to continue into the fourth quarter of 2022. It also sees sustained higher levels of unfavorable foreign currency translation impact. Moreover, raw material cost inflation remains at historically high levels but has started to moderate in some regions.The company expects selling prices to rise 10-12% compared with the prior-year fourth quarter, and also increase 18-20% on a two-year stacked basis. It anticipates fourth-quarter year-over-year segment earnings growth of nearly 20%, as segment margin recovery momentum accelerates on a year-over-year basis.PPG Industries will announce third-quarter results and provide further information on expectations for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Oct 19.Shares of PPG Industries have lost 28.4% in the past year compared with 13.6% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPPG Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Albemarle Corporation ALB, Ryerson Holding Corporation RYI and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.

108,aaad9946-22c0-39b7-b541-729518197042,PPG,2022-10-13,PPG Industries (PPG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-earnings-expected-140002486.html,1665583202,STORY,['PPG'],"[The market expects PPG Industries (PPG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.Revenues are expected to be $4.54 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.89% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries?For PPG Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.17%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PPG Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.81, delivering a surprise of +3.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PPG Industries doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bank's $11.69 billion profit at the time would have been $9.59 billion without the $2.1 in reserve releases.With expectations a recession is underway, inflation still persistently high, and savings accounts that were buoyed by fiscal stimulus checks dwindling, banks are preparing a line of defense in case some customers can't pay up on loans.""It's very much banks taking a slightly more conservative approach,"" Jackson explained. ""Just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession in 2023, so I think banks just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that.""Story continuesAmong those market participants is JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, who said earlier this week that the economy may be in a recession by mid-next year.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon testifies during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill September 22, 2022. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)And over the last few months, Dimon has highlighted headwinds such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, deteriorating consumer confidence, and “never-before-seen quantitative tightening.""""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said Monday in an interview with CNBC.JPMorgan set aside $428 million for loan loss reserves in the second quarter and $902 million in such funds during the first quarter, according to earnings statements.JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with financials from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) due out next week.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This is an extraordinary cross-section of young America, type A, highly successful young people. 68 languages spoken among these 2,400 interns. They're not your average, run of the mill interns is all I'm trying to point out here. But some interesting takeaways. What struck you?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, what struck me was some of their priorities when looking for a job. You mentioned the fact that a lot of them are type A, obviously very, very driven group of individuals. 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day. 21% say who their colleagues will be.Only 12%, though, putting company's purpose. And the reason I bring this up is because when we talk about Gen Z, when we talk about this generation, other results have shown this real focus on a company's purpose, how that is among the top priorities here for somebody who is seeking a job. So that not necessarily reflected in this survey, at least when you take a look at majority.Also only 8% focusing on advancement. I thought that that would have been a little bit higher as well. And then also, just plans to retire. And I like this because they're very optimistic. 35% saying that they want to retire between the ages of 55 and 65. On the other hand, 29%, nearly 1/3, want to work as long as possible. I also want to redo the survey in 10 years and want to find out if those 29% of people, Rachelle, would still say that they want to work as long as possible.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Oh, I think they will.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Yeah, I don't know. Check in on that every decade. I think for every decade you work, that enthusiasm is probably going to tamper down. I thought it was interesting. Obviously, in a very data driven business that they're in, when it came to where they turned to find their truth, when they came to getting information, 40% turned to friends and family, 35% turned to digital news outlets. So really, this shift is sort of where people are getting their information from. They consider clearly friends and family the more trusted source that they tend to go to. And then social media came in at about 14%.So I know, obviously, Twitter has this-- it seems like it has this, obviously, massive outreach. But in terms of where people sort of get their final information from and the sources that they trust, I thought that was interesting. And I know we talk a lot about the return to work. And 99% of them said that they believe that relationships are best formed in person because there is something that gets lost if you don't get to have that, at least some sort of face-to-face interaction. So you really get a sense of people. A lot can get lost in translation over text or video chat.DAVE BRIGGS: I was happy to hear that. You mentioned Twitter. TikTok was a surprise. Only 1% of these interns post on that. They all said, really overwhelmingly, Instagram as their platform, both posting and following. How do they pay for stuff? 47% use an app, only 2% cash. A lot of fascinating takeaways. They prefer shopping in person over online.SEANA SMITH: That was surprising to me. I would have thought the online would have been much, much higher.DAVE BRIGGS: Me, too. Cash is not king for the kids. Maybe in the markets right now, but not for the young people.SEANA SMITH: App on their phone. You know, I'm slowly using Apple Pay more and more. Once you start, it is life changing.]"

GS is slated to release third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 18, before market open. The company is expected to have witnessed year-over-year declines in revenues and earnings.In the previous quarter, Goldman’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While strength in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (“FICC”), wealth management, and consumer banking businesses acted as a tailwind, the company’s results were hurt by lower debt and equity underwriting revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate on three of the four occasions and missed on the other, the surprise being 19.4%, on average.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayGlobal Market Revenues: The macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions have led to uncertainty. Also, fears of an economic slowdown, high inflation and rising interest rates globally led to increased client activity and trading volume in the third quarter. Thus, FICC and equity trading are likely to have been decent in the third quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion for GS’s net revenues in the Global Markets segment suggests a 7.6% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Investment Banking (IB) Fees: After an extraordinary performance for almost two years, global deal-making shrank for the third consecutive quarter. Raging inflation, the equity markets’ rout and fears of a recession dealt a blow to business sentiments and plans for expansion via acquisitions. Thus, deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the third quarter.With companies veering away from debt and equity issuances, revenues from underwriting and advisory businesses are expected to have remained subdued in the quarter.While Goldman’s leading position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions is expected to have offered some support, low equity and bond volumes are anticipated to have been headwinds. The consensus estimate for IB fees of $1.96 billion indicates a 47% year-over-year decline.Our estimate for IB income is $2.39 billion, indicating a decline of 32.6%.Story continuesNet Interest Income (NII): While lending activity improved sequentially in the third quarter, the pace of loan growth across most categories slowed as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderated in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the third quarter. Hence, the company’s loan balances are likely to have improved in the third quarter.The positive impacts of the Fed hiking interest rates by 150 basis points, resulting in a policy rate of 3.0-3.25%, are likely to get reflected in the company NII in the third quarter.Asset Management Business: Goldman’s asset management business is likely to see the benefits of past inorganic growth moves. However, amid the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical fears, along with market declines and unfavorable credit spreads, Goldman’s asset management business is expected to have witnessed outflows in the quarter. Amid the market pullback, the consensus estimate for the company’s asset management revenues of $1.85 billion suggests an 18.4% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Expenses: Goldman’s investments in technology are anticipated to have led to a rise in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, a rise in transaction-based expenses due to higher client activity and inflationary pressure across most expense lines is expected to have dragged earnings.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Goldman has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat this time around.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is +2.00%.Zacks Rank: It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Prior to the third-quarter earnings release, Goldman’s quarterly activities were inadequate to gain adequate analyst confidence. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has been revised 5.6% downward to $7.46 over the past week. It suggests a 50% year-over-year fall.Our estimate for earnings is $8.24 per share.Also, the consensus estimate of $11.18 billion for quarterly revenues indicates a 17.9% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Our estimate for revenues is $11.13 billion.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookBankUnited BKU and Associated Banc-Corp ASB are a few other stocks that you might also want to consider, as these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model.The Earnings ESP for BKU is +1.32% and the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL, RPC Inc. RES and ProPetro Holding Corp. PUMP.Industry: Oilfield ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1990790/4-oilfield-services-stocks-to-gain-from-the-promising-industrySince the beginning of this year, the number of drillers in oil patches has increased significantly. Drilling activities will continue to rise since the crude pricing environment remains highly favorable. Thus, with explorers returning to prolific oil resources, demand for oilfield services will stay solid, making the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas- Field Services industry promising.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the improving business scenario are Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Co., RPC Inc. and ProPetro Holding Corp.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry comprises companies that primarily engage in providing support services to exploration and production players. These companies help in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining wells, drilling equipment, leasing of drilling rigs, seismic testing, as well as transport and directional solutions, among others. Also, the companies help upstream energy players locate oil and natural gas and drill and evaluate hydrocarbon wells.Hence, oilfield services businesses are positively correlated to expenditures from upstream firms. Furthermore, with countries worldwide investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, a few oilfield service companies are extending their reach beyond the hydrocarbon fields and capitalizing on contracts for manufacturing equipment used in LNG facilities to decrease carbon emissions.3 Trends Defining Oilfield Services Industry's FutureHigh Oil Price: The price of West Texas Intermediate crude is trading higher than the $85-per-barrel mark, following the agreement of OPEC+ for the biggest oil production cut since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The high commodity price is favorable for exploration and production activities, which will boost demand for oilfield service since oilfield service players assist drillers in efficiently setting up oil wells.Story continuesDigital Solutions: Oilfield service players are creating value for clients through digital solutions. With the introduction of a digital platform strategy, companies belonging to the industry are not only accelerating returns but also reducing cycle time. From increasing productivity and efficiency, oilfield service players are also reducing costs and carbon emissions, thereby optimizing cashflows.Growth in International &amp; North American Markets: Given the favorable upstream business scenarios, it is highly likely that capital spending will ramp up in both North American and international markets. Thus, demand for oilfield services will continue to grow this year and beyond, securing higher earnings.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services is a 24-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #32, which places it in the top 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500, Underperforms SectorThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year but remained below the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector.The industry has fallen 3.8% over this period against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 18.2% and the broader sector’s 18.8% rally.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 11.32X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.05X and sector’s 3.42X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.21X, as low as 1.95X, with a median of 9.50X.4 Oilfield Services Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackSchlumberger Limited: Schlumberger is a leading oilfield service player with operations in domestic and international markets. It is well placed to capitalize on the improving demand for oilfield services, given increasing drilling operations.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s portfolio of transition technologies could significantly help clients reduce their carbon footprint. ProPetro Holding Corp: Thebusiness scenario for ProPetro Holding is bright, given the current high oilfield service demand. Thus, it secures handsome cashflows as it is a leading provider of pressure pumping and other complementary services.For 2022 and 2023, ProPetro Holding, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is likely to see earnings growth of 158.5% and 334.2%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Halliburton Company: Halliburton is also a leading oilfield service player, capitalizing on improving demand for oilfield services. Looking ahead, it expects industry fundamentals to remain conducive, which will spur growth in both North American and overseas markets.Halliburton, with a Zacks Rank of 3, believes it is perfectly placed to benefit from this emerging multi-year upcycle based on its smart strategy, digital leadership and capital efficiency while aiming for a sustainable energy future. HAL’s cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet strength should also ensure increased shareholder returns.RPC Inc: RPC is a leading energy name offering a wide range of oilfield services to key exploration and production players. It has a conservative balance sheet and a proven business model that can manage to sail through numerous oilfield cycles.RPC, with a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), has strong capabilities in executing multi-stage completion activities in unconventional wells.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

119,04fb3515-4275-3d53-a749-c4370730afab,NTRS,2022-10-13,Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-corporation-ntrs-earnings-140002365.html,1665583202,STORY,"['NTRS', 'TFC-PR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.77 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.88% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust Corporation?For Northern Trust Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Northern Trust Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northern Trust Corporation would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of -2.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northern Trust Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Truist Financial Corporation (TFC), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -10.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.93 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Truist Financial Corporation has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.81%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Truist Financial Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

121,01f32f45-dc27-35e1-a7fd-9654fb913708,NFLX,2022-10-13,"Getting In Cheap On Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Is Unlikely",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/getting-cheap-netflix-inc-nasdaq-110056443.html,1665658856,STORY,['NFLX'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 19.3x Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent earnings growth for Netflix has been in line with the market. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this modest earnings performance will accelerate. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix peKeen to find out how analysts think Netflix's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Netflix's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 16% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 334% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.1% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.5% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Netflix's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Bottom Line On Netflix's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesOur examination of Netflix's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Netflix has 2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Netflix.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is here with the details. Allie, we talked about the fact that it was a hit right off the bat. I haven't watched it yet, but people love it.ALEXANDRA CANAL: People love it. I haven't watched it yet either.DAVE BRIGGS: Me neither.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I am scared to watch it. I've heard it's an emotional roller coaster. But America loves true crime. And the numbers are proving it. In the first three weeks, it has amassed more than 701 million hours viewed, making it the second biggest series to date for Netflix--DAVE BRIGGS: Gosh.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --behind ""Stranger Things."" So it actually dethroned ""Bridgerton."" And you know when you're dethroning ""Bridgerton"" that you have a massive, massive hit on your hands. And for a little context behind that number, ""Stranger Things"" Season 4 racked up 1.35 billion hours viewed in the first month. So the fact that ""Dahmer"" even came close is a huge accomplishment. ""Stranger Things"" has a really big fan base, has that strong IP.So ""Dahmer"" doing really well, great thing for Netflix, but also a great thing for Ryan Murphy. This is his third year into his five-year contract with Netflix. He signed a $300 million deal back in 2018. And this is really the first series from him to really drum up that big response that Netflix wanted. So people have been a little critical, saying whether or not ""Dahmer"" is really worth that $300 million price tag. We'll see what else Ryan Murphy can pull out there. I think also Netflix is not going to be giving out $300 million contracts any time soon.DAVE BRIGGS: I mean, Shonda. Shonda got one, too.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, she got one, too, and that was during the heyday.DAVE BRIGGS: She needs to follow up ""Bridgerton.""ALEXANDRA CANAL: That was the heyday of Netflix when they didn't care. They were just giving out money left and right. That's not going to happen anymore.SEANA SMITH: They're cutting costs a little bit.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But true crime, obviously, it's a win every time.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously, a lot's changed since those $300 million deals, including a considerable subscriber falloff this year for Netflix. But the streaming giant is in the running to build a massive production facility on a former Army base along the Jersey Shore. Tell us more about that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, you said it. 300 acres, Jersey Shore, about 50 miles from New York City. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy is all about this. He's been dying to bring some more Hollywood productions to New Jersey. There's a lot of artists. There's a lot of creatives there, especially with the close proximity to New York. And if this deal does go through, it'll be the second largest studio for the company after New Mexico.So we could be seeing some more productions along the Jersey coastline. I am a Jersey girl. So, you know, I fully approve this move by Netflix. But we'll see what happens once this deal officially goes through. They were in talks last year, so despite the profitability struggles, despite the fact that they've been losing subscribers, they still seem to be full steam ahead on this. So that just indicates to me that they want to produce more content and better content.SEANA SMITH: Doing all they can to try and attract those new subscribers, something that they've been struggling to do, like you said. All right, Allie Canal, thank you.]"

HBO Max, now owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, released 114 episodes in the third quarter — significantly fewer episodes than usual and comprising the lightest slate for the service since Q2 2020, the second quarter after launch. WBD has been paring back HBO Max’s content slate in recent months as it looks to cut costs.All told, Netflix premiered 159 original and exclusive shows in Q3, topping its previous high-water mark of 143 in Q4 2021 (which totaled nearly 900 episodes). Top TV titles Netflix premiered in the most recent quarter include Ryan Murphy’s “Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” starring Evan Peters, which in its first three weeks has become the second most viewed English TV show on Netflix (after “Stranger Things 4”).Other buzzy releases were Neil Gaiman’s “The Sandman,” “Cobra Kai” Season 5, “Locke &amp; Key” Season 3 and docu-series “How to Build a Sex Room.” In addition, Netflix dropped the final two episodes of “Stranger Things 4” on July 1 — a bid to pull fans of the show into its Q3 subscriber numbers.Netflix’s big surge in Q3 came after a slowdown in output related to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. And the bump comes as the U.S. streaming market has plateaued at 81% of U.S. households, according to survey data from HarrisX commissioned by MoffettNathanson.“Streaming’s penetration of American households has hit maturity, as has nearly every individual serviceexcept for the newest entrants of Peacock and Paramount+,” the firm wrote in its Q3 SVOD Tracker report. “Streaming services are no longer vying to add customers new to streaming, but rather to add (and keep) customers already within the streaming ecosystem.”Story continuesSource: MoffettNathansonNetflix has taken a “something for everyone” strategy, as Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos has said — although that doesn’t mean everyone will be a fan of everything on the service. (Indeed, watching more than 1,000 episodes in a 90-day span would be virtually impossible.) According to the streamer, customers on average watch six different genres every month, ranging from drama to horror and from comedy to kids.So Netflix, by releasing five times as much raw TV tonnage as its nearest competitors, is looking to cover the waterfront with stuff that appeals to a variety of tastes. But, of course, quantity isn’t everything, as the MoffettNathanson team pointed out: Amid its lower-than-usual volume of originals in Q3, HBO Max released “The House of the Dragon,” the “Game of Thrones” prequel series that was heavily marketed and has been a strong ratings draw. As of Sept. 20, “HOTD” Season 1 was averaging 29 million viewers per episode across all platforms.Meanwhile, note that the episode counts don’t include licensed second-run shows.

The big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: What's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time, I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the be all, end all. If we take a look at the numbers here, Netflix says it expects revenue at $7.85 billion, adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share. They expect that subscriber number to come in at 1 million. I actually think they might even beat on that subscriber number due to the success of ""Dahmer."" That series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list.But going back to what's happening at the company right now, ad-supported, that is going to be a big driver. There's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street. We've seen a lot of upgrades. The stock is up 18% over the past three months, widely outpacing the broader market. We still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility. There's a lot of competition. We have Disney's ad-supported coming out in December.People are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1 to beat Disney to the punch. But right now, I think, ultimately, analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the ad-supported. And they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability. So that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report.AKIKO FUJITA: You'd think that people will be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of which advertisers would be willing to pay up. But I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that, at least, the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And that's been some of the bearish sentiment, too, because Netflix is charging a really high premium to a lot of these advertisers. So if they even want to be on the platform, they're paying above industry standard. And that could be a risk.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, an important point to point out there. Allie Canal, thanks so much for that.]"

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the fund returned -29.7% compared to a -19.6% return for the benchmark Index.

Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an entertainment services company. On October 11, 2022, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock closed at $214.29 per share. One-month return of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was -4.39% and its shares lost 65.97% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a market capitalization of $95.296 billion.Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)  in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (U.S.), a subscription streaming service and production company, was a top contributor for the quarter. Netflix’s share price reacted positively in response to second-quarter results that were strong, in our assessment, and largely better than investors expected. Although the company lost roughly one million global streaming subscribers, the loss was only about half of what management projected. Revenue in constant currency, excluding foreign currency impacts, rose 13% year-over-year, and management is projecting that third-quarter revenue will rise by 12% in constant currency. While currency exchange rates also affected earnings, margins are tracking slightly ahead of prior guidance when adjusted for currency impacts. Importantly, viewer engagement, which we see as a key metric, remains strong. In the U.S., Netflix had as much viewing time in the 2021-22 season as the top two cable networks combined (CBS and NBC), and total share of TV time reached a record in June, according to Nielsen. Along with the earnings release, management stated that the company is making progress on its advertising and password-sharing initiatives. Cash content costs for the next two to three years are expected to be unchanged at roughly $17 billion as Netflix continues to invest in high-quality content creation. Management is forecasting the net addition of one million global streaming subscribers in the third quarter, and we remain pleased with the company’s fundamental performance.”Story continuesNetflix, Inc.

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Phillips 66 (PSX) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 4.9%, the stock of this oil refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PSX meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 5.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PSX is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.36. This indicates that the stock moves 36% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PSX has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PSX earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PSX is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PSX is currently trading at 0.29 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 29 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PSX appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PSX, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) and SAP SE (SAP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;JPMorgan Chase shares have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (-36.7% vs. -30.0%). The company’s volatile nature in the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging. Our estimates for non-interest income (managed) indicate a decline almost 15% this year. Steadily rising operating expenses remain a key headwind.Given the possibility of an economic downturn and to meet higher capital requirements, the bank has suspended buybacks. However, opening new branches, strategic buyouts/investments and global expansion and digitization efforts are likely to keep driving the company’s financials.Further, higher interest rates and steady growth in loan demand are expected to result in a robust improvement in net interest income (NII). Our estimates for NII (managed) suggest a CAGR of around 19% over the next three years.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here &gt;&gt;&gt;)T-Mobile US shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+17.0% vs. -21.8%). The company is experiencing healthy customer growth driven by diligent execution of operational plans.

Its Extended Range 5G covers 320 million people. The Ultra Capacity 5G covers 235 million people. T-Mobile continues to deploy 5G with the mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum from Sprint.However, it operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding its profitability. Furthermore, it is engaging in leasing strategy to gain customers, thereby exposing it to credit risk. Debt obligation woes also persist.(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;)SAP shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-40.8% vs. -30.4%). The company has lowered full-year operating profit guidance due to the €350-million negative impact from the war in Ukraine and expectations of a continued decline in software licenses revenue.Stiff competition and higher costs to enhance cloud-based offerings is likely to exert pressure on the company’s profitability in the near term. However, SAP’s performance is gaining from strength in its cloud business, especially the new Rise with SAP solution.Momentum in SAP’s Business Process Intelligence platform, particularly the S/4HANA solutions along with healthy traction witnessed in SuccessFactors Employee Central, Ariba and Fieldglass, Qualtrics and other cloud-based offerings is noteworthy.

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$4.9m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$246, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 40% of Jonathan Graham's holding.Amgen insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Amgen Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Amgen. Specifically, Lead Independent Director Robert Eckert ditched US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Amgen Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$206m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Amgen Insiders?An insider sold Amgen shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Amgen is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Amgen. For example - Amgen has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: Amgen may not be the best stock to buy.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 2.3% loss over the past four weeks.Share prices likely rose after the analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock’s recommendation to “Overweight” from Equal Weight. The analysts expect the company’s pipeline drug AMG133 to have a blockbuster potential after it exhibited a strong impact on weight following a single dose administration.This world's largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.4%. Revenues are expected to be $6.59 billion, down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Amgen, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

137,0c06d6bc-144c-382b-b271-139a9e2a4a96,AMGN,2022-10-13,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Amgen Inc. (AMGN) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-amgen-inc-130001692.html,1665579601,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has lost 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.51 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $17.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +2.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.07 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.15 billion and $27.37 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +4.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1%. EPS of $4.65 for the same period compares with $4.38 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.77%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market participants remained worried that the continuation of the ultra-hawkish monetary policies of the Fed and slower economic growth will result into recession in the near-future. The Dow managed to ended in green while both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite finished in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.1% to close at 29,239.19, terminating a four-day losing streak. Notably, 17 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory while 13 in red. At session’s high, the blue-chip index was up more than 400 points.The major gainer of the Dow was Amgen Inc. AMGN. Shares of the company surged 5.7%. Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 10,426.19, sliding 1.1% or 115.91 points  due to disappointing performance of large-cap chip-set manufacturers. The tech-laden index has recorded a five-day losing streak.The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7% to end at 3,588.84, posting a five-day losing run. In the intra-day trading, the broad-market index fell to a 2-year low. Eight out of 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in negative territory while three in positive zone. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 3.6% to 33.63. A total of 11.65 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.73 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.IMF Cuts Global Growth RateThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reduced its global economic growth rate for 2023 to 2.7% from 2.9% estimated in July. However, the agency maintained its 2022 global growth forecast at 3.2%. The IMF predicted that a large part of the world will feel like a recession in 2023.Story continuesThe agency cited three major reasons for this tepid outlook, namely, mounting inflationary pressure across the globe due to the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, lingering geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine and China’s economic slowdown.The IMF anticipates that global inflation rate will peak in late 2022 at 8.8% compared with 4.7% in 2021 and will stay elevated for a longer-than-expected period. Global inflation is estimated to come down to 6.5% in 2023 and to 4.1% by 2024.Investors Remain Skeptical on RecoveryMarket participants were worried that the Fed will purse it ultra-hawkish monetary policies buoyed by a robust labor market. In its September FOMC meeting, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate for 2022 to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means, the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively. Further, the central bank has projected that the median of the benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. Consequently, yields on U.S. government bonds of different maturity spiked significantly.The ICE Dollar index is currently hovering around its 20-year high level. Economists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To access the full Report, visit https://www.amgenbiosimilars.com/commitment/trends-report.""Our 2022 Biosimilar Trends Report found that the marketplace with biosimilars is well established, and the U.S. is poised to see continued growth in biosimilar approvals. This is good news for patients, physicians and payers, as the successful adoption of biosimilars has increased competition and generally lowered treatment costs associated with biologic medicines,"" said Jen Norton, vice president and head of U.S. Value &amp; Access at Amgen.New data from the Report confirm that biosimilar uptake in the U.S. continues to increase over time, resulting in significant market share in most therapeutic areas where biosimilars have been introduced. In fact, for therapeutic areas that have had biosimilars launch in the last three years, the average biosimilar share was 75 percent compared to 39 percent in the preceding three years.1""The trends highlighted in the Report underscore that it's an exciting time for the marketplace with biosimilars. As biosimilars become more widely available in the U.S., they have the potential to help to control costs for patients, payers and health systems,"" said Chelsee Jensen, pharmaceutical formulary manager at the Mayo Clinic.The Report also discusses biosimilars' potential to expand access to treatment options that may lower healthcare costs.2 In particular, the Report found:Trends show an increase in savings per quarter, and in Q2 alone, savings in drug spend due to biosimilar availability are estimated to be $3.2 billion.3Biosimilars primarily covered under the medical benefit have typically launched at a wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) that is generally 10% to 57% lower than that of the reference product.4There are currently seven FDA-approved biosimilars for the reference product HUMIRA, with the possibility of seven or more launches in 2023.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Junior Mining Gold Stocks to Buy in 2022. A junior mining company refers to a firm exploring for new deposits of gold, silver, copper, uranium, or other precious metals. A junior mining gold company is usually in the development and exploration phase, and is actively searching for new mineral properties with bigger natural deposits. Junior mining gold companies catch the interest of growth investors, since these stocks tend to explode when the firm finds huge deposits and start production. Many junior mining firms are trading as penny stocks, and they usually do not pay dividends, so the excess capital can be reinvested to expand operational capacity. In the beginning of October, the US dollar finally lost some steam and the U.S. Treasury yields declined, and investors turned towards safe haven assets like gold once again. Currently, gold is trading near record-high levels. As per a World Gold Council report, demand for gold climbed 12% year-over-year in the first half of 2022. Demand for gold in Q1 2022 jumped 34%, which is the greatest quarterly increase in demand in the gold market since 2018.Given the global demand for gold and limited supply, Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for the price of gold to hit $2,500 an ounce by the end of 2022. The World Gold Council expects gold price per ounce to exceed $3,000 over the next few years. Currently, the price of gold is declining as interest rates go up, because currently higher-yielding assets are more attractive for investors. However, there is minimal historical evidence which suggests that gold is permanently weakened by federal rate hikes in the long-term. A study of the gold market during the 1970s indicated that gold price reached its record-time high price when interest rates were high and swiftly increasing.Some of the elite players in the gold market include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM). Investors who would like exposure to gold, and seek exponential growth potential, can look out for junior mining gold stocks.Story continues10 Best Junior Mining Gold Stocks to Buy in 2022Copyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology We selected the best junior mining gold stocks based on their current or future gold projects, positive analyst coverage, and potential for higher scalability in the future.

DLTR revealed plans to recruit thousands of full and part-time associates for the upcoming holiday season through a Nationwide Hiring Event on Oct 19 from 11 am to 6 pm. The company will hire sales associates, customer service representatives, stockers, assistant store managers and store managers.Hired employees will be offered competitive pay, a comprehensive rewards package and flexible schedules. Associates will also gain from DailyPay — a voluntary benefit wherein they can receive their earnings between traditional paydays.Moving on, the company has an education assistance program called ValuED, which provides financial support and a wide range of development opportunities for upskilling. As part of this, full-time associates will be eligible for tuition discounts and reimbursement allowances for college degrees, GED programs and language courses.Several other retailers have kicked off their hiring session for the holiday season through seasonal recruits that will improve customer shopping experiences. Retailers are increasingly focused on strengthening supply chains to avoid disruptions, which have been deterrents for a while.We note that supermarket giant Walmart WMT is leaving no stone unturned to leverage the upcoming holiday season. WMT unveiled plans to deploy 40,000 workers at more than 250 Walmart and Sam’s Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and transportation offices earlier this month.The new positions include seasonal store associates, customer service associates and 1,500 full-time truck drivers. Walmart employed 150,000 associates during the 2021 holiday season.Macy’s M announced plans to recruit 41,000 associates ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 48,000 seasonal associates for the 2021 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transit into permanent roles.Kroger KR recently unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. KR is likely to recruit 1,500 associates for full and part-time positions for their North Texas stores.Vacancies are available in all departments, including retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, supply chain, merchandising, logistics, corporate, pharmacy and healthcare. Kroger hired more than 20,000 associates through its nationwide hiring event for the 2021 holiday sale.Coming back to DLTR, all is not good in the hood for the company. Dollar Tree has been witnessing inflationary pressures and consumers’ shifts toward lower-margin consumable products. Its second-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected adverse impacts of freight expenses, markdowns, shrink and unfavorable product mix.As a result, the company announced plans to make competitive pricing investments in the Family Dollar chain to improve store productivity and profitability in the long run. Going forward, management expects gross and operating margins for the Family Dollar segment to remain pressured mainly due to the aforementioned pricing factor.The company estimates the mix shift to consumables to hurt Family Dollar by 300 basis points (bps). Driven by the accelerated price investment, it expects the Family Dollar segment to report a break-even operating margin in the second half, down from its first-half margin of 2%.Higher SG&amp;A expenses from elevated payroll, increase in repairs and maintenance expenses, and store facility costs remain concerning. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 24% due to higher repairs and maintenance costs, store payroll, stock compensation expenses, general insurance liability, utilities, and other inflationary pressures.Consequently, Dollar Tree lowered the earnings per share view for fiscal 2022. Management envisions earnings of $7.10-$7.40 per share for fiscal 2022 compared with the prior stated $7.80-$8.20 per share. The company anticipates earnings of $1.05-$1.20 per share for the fiscal third quarter.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock plunged 14.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.4%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data confirmed German harmonised inflation was 10.9% y/y in September and almost 10% in Sweden, but all eyes are on U.S. consumer price inflation data due at 1230 GMT.Paul O'Connor, Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors, said the question investors have is whether central banks like the Fed are getting close to the end of their interest rate hikes.""Are we there yet? My feeling is that we are quite close to pricing in peak rates, but on the growth story I think there are probably a lot of downgrades still to come,"" he said.Interest rate hikes take a year to 18 months to fully take effect. As a result ""it is quite plausible that around the end of the year, the central banks declare a pause...labour markets will be cooling and housing markets will be falling.""Story continuesThe headline U.S. CPI figure is expected to have slipped back two tenths of a percentage point to a still-bruising 8.1%, but the 'core' number which strips out the more volatile components is forecast to rise again to 6.5% from 6.3%.Minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting released on Wednesday showed many officials ""emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action"".Several policymakers did stress, however, that it would be important to ""calibrate"" the pace of further rate hikes to reduce the risk of ""significant adverse effects"" on the economy.Treasury yields were choppy in Europe. The U.S. 10-year benchmark yield initially ticked up to 3.923% but then dropped back to 3.894% with most of the equivalent European yields down a touch too.Markets lay 90% odds for another 75 basis-point Fed rate hike in November, versus 10% probability of a half-point bump.CONCERNEDIn Asia, widespread equity market weakness had seen Japan's Nikkei slip 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi tumble 1.8% as news that Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC was seeing demand drop and was cutting its investment budget by at least 10% hit the wider region's tech sector.Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.9% and mainland Chinese blue chips lost 0.3% to leave MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares close to 2 1/2-year lows.U.S. emini stock futures offered some hope though, rising 0.5% after the S&amp;P 500's sixth straight drop on Wednesday.""The risk of an over-tightening episode and some mishap in financial markets is higher than I can remember,"" said Tom Nash, a fixed income portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management in Sydney.HEROICThe dollar index, which gauges the greenback against six major rivals, inched down to 112.92 ahead of the CPI data.The U.S. currency remained close to a fresh 24-year high to the yen and last changed hands at 146.79 while sterling roared up almost 1.5% to $1.1263 on the reports of possible tax cut changes. It had hit two-week trough of $1.0925 on Tuesday.Benchmark 10-year gilt yields, which erupted after the UK government laid out tax cutting plans last month, had swung from a fresh 14-year peak at 4.632% to 4.249% in early afternoon trading.The Bank of England has insisted that its emergency bond market support will expire on Friday as originally announced, countering media reports of continued aid if necessary.BoE Governor Andrew Bailey had riled markets on Tuesday by saying British pension funds and other investors hit hard by a slump in bond prices had until that deadline to fix their problems.""I would say it's heroic to say the risk of some sort of systemic problem has been extinguished because these are big moves and we don't now how much deleveraging needs to be done,"" Janus Henderson's O'Connor said. ""Markets still feel very dysfunctional"".Meanwhile, crude oil markets regained their footing following a 2% slide on Wednesday amid worries over demand.Brent crude futures bounced 23 cents, or 0.25%, to $92.69 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 21 cents, or 0.2%, at $87.44 a barrel.Last week, the producer group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia pushed prices higher when it agreed to cut supply by 2 million barrels per day (bpd).(Additional reporting by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Editing by Alexander Smith, Kirsten Donovan)]"

In any other country we would have stopped this operation. But in the Netherlands that was impossible because the Netherlands was dependent on Groningen gas.""A damning report in 2015 from the independent Dutch Safety Board had accused the government and the field's operators of ignoring the threat of earthquakes linked to the field for years. As vast amounts of gas were removed from under the province since 1963, the ground sank and settled above empty pockets, triggering quakes.Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government has capped Groningen production at 2.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year starting Oct. 1, roughly 7% of annual domestic consumption in the Netherlands. That compares with 42.5 bcm in 2014.As gas prices skyrocketed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Rutte has said production at the field could only be increased again if households face a physical shortage.The inquiry is looking into decision-making around the quakes, which are continuing, and compensation for owners of tens of thousands of buildings those quakes have damaged.Rutte is due to testify later on Thursday.

On top of that, Hurricane Ian forced offshore producers in the U.S. to scale back production.Even the head of Saudi Arabia’s state-led oil company, Saudi Aramco, is concerned. Earlier this month, he issued a dire warning that prices could spike soon due to Aramco's “extremely low” capacity.Which means Americans should be preparing for a very expensive winter.But with President Biden set to release 25 million more barrels of the country’s “oil piggy bank” to the market by the end of the year and the supply of diesel running dangerously low, many Americans may be wondering why not just hold onto that supply to keep the lights on here?At $60 or more for a tank, it can be frustrating to watch as domestic oil leaves U.S. ports faster than foreign oil comes in. But it’s a decades-old challenge, and only the nature of the crisis has changed.Don't missOver 65% of Americans don't shop around for a better car insurance deal — and that could be costing you $500 a monthYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income every quarter)A TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by cash stuffing – can it work for you?Leading from behindThe United States is the world’s top producer of oil (including crude, other petroleum liquids, and biofuels) and has been since 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, it’s not even close.The EIA reports that as of 2021, the U.S. produced 18.88 million barrels per day — or about 10 million per day more than no. 2 Saudi Arabia (10.84 million) and no. 3 Russia (10.78 million).The EIA also notes that the U.S. is the largest oil consumer, using 20.54 million barrels a day, or 20% of the global stock, and well ahead of no. 2 China (14.01 million). The U.S. imported 7.86 million barrels of oil per day last year, the EIA report reveals.Story continuesSo if America is producing roughly the same amount of oil as it imports, and interest in renewables is rising, shouldn’t it be true that the U.S. would not be so reliant on foreign oil, and that energy price anxieties should subside because U.S. stocks would be more than adequate?Not by a long shot.Oil price and politicsThe reasons for the import/export discrepancy are actually fairly straightforward. Chief among them:Foreign oil is cheaper: The cost of extraction is usually lower in other countries.Rystad Energy, a private energy research firm, found in a 2020 analysis that Middle Eastern oil fields have the world’s lowest production cost at $31 a barrel. The U.S. produced oil from deepwater wells was at $43 a barrel, with fracking-produced oil costing $44 a barrel.Energy as a weapon: Prices are frequently connected to how nations regard the environmental, economic and geopolitical impacts of their oil.Some concerns weigh heavier than others. Russia, for instance, is widely seen as using oil as a tool to gain concessions over its invasion of Ukraine.Read more: The great escape: Rich young professionals earning over $100K are fleeing California and New York — here's why and where they are headedThe Russian invasion eventually prompted President Biden to sign a ban on Russian oil imports, but it’s unclear how much the ban has deterred Vladimir Putin. Europe now faces new uncertainty about accessibility to critical Russian oil ahead of winter.Not all oil is the same: This is a fundamental challenge for the U.S., where much of the nation’s refining capacity is built to handle the heavy, harder-to-refine crude imported from the Middle East and elsewhere. That U.S. capacity wasn’t aimed at refining the kind of light, sweet crude that characterizes the flush oil fields of Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere.Shifting U.S. refining capacity to light crude could create incredible upheaval in the market and jeopardize enormous existing investments, the American Petroleum Institute says.Attempts to correct that mismatch have almost always stalled out, often over environmental protests or other political realities. Most believe the current situation won’t change until new refining capacity comes online or the current capacity is upgraded to handle what the U.S. produces. The costs of such a shift would be enormous.What to read next‘Unhealthy and unsustainable’: Homebuyers aren’t buying and homebuilders aren’t building in the face of untamed mortgage ratesThe US now has just 25 days of diesel supply — the lowest since 2008.

It has fallen nearly 4.3% in the last six days, with markets worried that aggressive global interest rate hikes will trigger recessions.Data had already confirmed German harmonised inflation was +10.9% y/y in September but all eyes are on U.S. CPI data due at 1230 GMT.Paul O'Connor, Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors, said the question investors have is whether central banks like the Fed are getting close to the end of their interest rate hikes.""Are we there yet? My feeling is that we are quite close to pricing in peak rates, but on the growth story I think there are probably a lot of downgrades still to come,"" he said.Interest rate hikes take a year to 18 months to fully take effect. As a result ""it is quite plausible that around the end of the year, the central banks declare a pause... labour markets will be cooling and housing markets will be falling.""Story continuesMinutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting released on Wednesday had showed many officials ""emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action"".Several policymakers did stress, however, that it would be important to ""calibrate"" the pace of further rate hikes to reduce the risk of ""significant adverse effects"" on the economy.Treasury yields were edging up in Europe. The U.S. 10-year benchmark yield ticked up 2 basis points to 3.923%, although most of the equivalent European yields were down a touch.In Asia overnight, widespread weakness had seen Japan's Nikkei slip 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi tumble 1.8% as news that Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC had cut its investment budget by at least 10% pressured the wider region's tech sector.Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.9%, and mainland Chinese blue chips lost 0.3% to leave MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares languishing close to 2 1/2-year lows.U.S. emini stock futures offered some hope though, rising 0.1% following another drop on S&amp;P 500 overnight.""I'm more concerned than I've been for some time,"" said Tom Nash, a fixed income portfolio manager at UBS Asset Management in Sydney. ""The risk of an over-tightening episode and some mishap in financial markets is higher than I can remember.""HEROICFed Governor Michelle Bowman took a hawkish stance in a speech on Wednesday, saying that if high inflation does not start to wane she will continue to support aggressive rate rises.Markets lay 90% odds for another 75 basis-point rate hike in November, versus 10% probability of a half-point bump.The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against six major rivals, barely budged from around 113.25 ahead of the CPI data.The U.S. currency remained close to a fresh 24-year high to the yen and last changing hands at 146.81 while sterling sagged to $1.1050 albeit it was still up from Tuesday's a two-week trough of $1.0925.Benchmark 10-year gilt yields had swung from a fresh 14-year peak at 4.632% to sit at 4.337% in early trading.The Bank of England insisted that its emergency bond market support will expire on Friday as originally announced, countering media reports of continued aid if necessary.BoE Governor Andrew Bailey had riled markets on Tuesday by saying British pension funds and other investors hit hard by a slump in bond prices had until that deadline to fix their problems.""Obviously the markets appear a little bit rattled and I think everyone remains worried about the stability of the UK financial markets - this is extraordinary.""""I would say it's heroic to say the risk of some sort of systemic problem has been extinguished because these are big moves and we don't now how much deleveraging needs to be done,"" Janus Henderson's O'Connor said. ""Markets still feel very dysfunctional""Meanwhile, crude oil markets remained weak following a 2% slide on Wednesday amid worries over demand.Brent crude futures dropped 7 cents, or 0.1%, to $92.38 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 21 cents, or 0.2%, at $87.06 a barrel.(Additional reporting by Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Editing by William Maclean)]"

Master accounts would allow Custodia to deposit funds with the Fed and be connected directly to the global financial system.By virtue of being a well-established bank, BNY would have a master account with the Fed. Without a master account, institutions like Custodia would need to use an intermediary bank and be subject to that bank's rules, regulations, and fee structure. In June, Custodia filed suit against the Fed alleging that the U.S. central bank was unlawfully delaying its application and has the support of a number of Republican lawmakers. “Last week, the Federal Reserve told a federal judge that keeping custody of digital assets, like bitcoin, posed a ‘novel, precedent-setting risk.’ This week, the Fed allowed BNY Mellon to do the exact same thing. So it has one rule for innovators like Custodia Bank, and another for the nation’s oldest bank,” said Nathan Miller, a spokesperson for Custodia Bank, in an email to CoinDesk. “After waiting more than 24 months, we are seeking nothing more than fair and equal treatment.”For its part, the Fed has argued that granting master accounts to banks that provide custodial services for digital assets poses risks to the global financial system and thus it needs additional time to evaluate their applications fully. In August, the Fed published its final guidance for master account access which involves multiple tiers of access.In its suit, Custodia said that BNY's approval ""directly refutes the central argument advanced by [the Fed].""Story continues""If holding custody of digital assets poses “novel, precedent-setting risk” to the United States financial system, as defendants suggest in their motions, then the board could have – indeed, should have – prevented BNY from engaging in such activities, especially since BNY is a global systematically important bank,"" Custodia argued.Custodia is not seeking any sort of relief from the Court, only for it to examine a press release from BNY Mellon announcing its digital asset custody platform.]"
156,a1f878f0-b290-320f-99ca-add13450b9d7,BK,2022-10-13,"Analysis-Russian law on stock conversion baffles global banks, clients",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-russian-law-stock-conversion-044438392.html,1665636278,STORY,['BK'],"[By Carolina Mandl and Sinead CruiseNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors and banks have been voicing confusion about their efforts to convert depositary receipts of Russian companies into ordinary shares in compliance with a new Russian law, according to advisors and client communications from the banks.Some banks including Citigroup and BNY Mellon have had to temporarily halt these processes, after Moscow made a drive to ensure Russian firms axe their depositary receipt programs. The intent of the law was to reduce the influence of foreign banks on Russian companies after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Many international investors who have tried to convert their Russian assets have been unable to do so, the advisors said.""This is complete chaos now,"" said Grigory Marinichev, a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, which is advising roughly 300 investors and brokerages. ""Nobody understands what is happening and what will happen next.""JPMorgan &amp; Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon act as depositary banks for most Russian depositary receipt programs, according to Clearstream. Depositary receipts are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange.In statements to clients, some banks cited difficulties verifying there are enough shares to execute cancellations of depositary receipts.For example, BNY Mellon cited such a difficulty with Global Depositary Receipts in Russian gas company Novatek.""BNY Mellon has closed its books for cancellations with respect to the Novatek DR program until a complete reconciliation of its books,"" BNY told clients in a Sept. 2 statement. On Sept. 27, BNY started accepting cancellations again, but said it could close it again at any moment due to reconciliation issues. The bank declined further comment.Citi, after closing books ""to ensure a complete and accurate reconciliation"", reopened them last week. But the bank said in a statement to clients dated Oct. 5 seen by Reuters it may face reconciliation issues due to cancellations taking place directly in Russia.Story continuesSome large international funds have spent months devising ways to maximize potential returns for clients with stranded exposures.BlackRock has been working to convert its depositary receipts, parking the underlying securities in a structure with a view to returning sales proceeds or income when sanctions permit and when market conditions allow some recovery in their value, a source close to the matter told Reuters. Reuters has been unable to verify whether BlackRock encountered any reconciliation problems.One of the biggest U.S. pension funds separately told Reuters it did not see a clear solution for the securities as different rules in the United States and in Russia bar a divestment. The fund declined to be named because its investment strategies are private.LOOMING DEADLINEMoscow has imposed a Nov. 10 deadline for so-called forced conversion of shares.In April, Moscow originally demanded a raft of Russian firms axe their depositary receipts programs. Initially, some companies ordered global banks and brokerages to cancel the depositary receipts, but in July Russia allowed investors to convert depository receipts into common shares directly in a process known as ""forced conversion"" that bypassed global banks.In practical terms, this means some investors may end up taking possession of the underlying shares without formally cancelling the depositary receipts linked to those shares. While depositary receipts are under custody of global banks, the shares they represent are parked in Russia.This has created headaches for the banks who effectively acted as guardians of the programs. They were struggling to match or ""reconcile"" the depository receipts on their books with the underlying shares now in Russian banks.To avoid such issues, global banks decided to stop accepting cancellation requests. For awhile, this left investors only with the option of cancelling the depositary receipts directly in Russia, advisors said.""Banks may end up having more people requesting a redemption than shares they have to deliver. This would create a legal liability,"" said Marc Zboch, an investment professional who launched the website ""Russia Deadline"" to help investors convert their receipts for a fee.Foreign investors who want to convert their depositary receipts into local shares using the forced conversion must also jump through some hoops, supplying documents supporting their ownership which must be translated into Russian and notarized. Investors must present these in person in Russia either themselves or using a legal representative, according to advisors.Investors are meanwhile discussing ways online to meet the Russian requirements and how to pay fees to Russian banks. Some investors are active in online discussion groups like the RU GDR/ADR Community on the Discord platform as they try to navigate the situation. They also complain their global brokers have not cooperated processing their requests or providing the required documents.""Investors are sandwiched between a rock and a hard place,"" said Marinichev.(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York and Sinead Cruise in London; editing by Megan Davies and David Gregorio)]"

Its revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to have witnessed a rise on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest revenues and fee revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline and higher expenses hurt results to some extent.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and met in one of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 1.7%, on average.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.10, which has been unchanged over the past seven days. The estimate indicates a rise of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $1.09.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.18 billion, implying a 3.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $4.19 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Fee Revenues: Supported by overall asset inflows in the third quarter, BNY Mellon is expected to have recorded an improvement in the total assets under management (AUM) balance. Thus, the related fee is likely to have increased.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.16 billion, which indicates a rise of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $2.10 billion, indicating a marginal year-over-year rise.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $46.78 million, which suggests a 2.5% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $46.3 million, indicating a decline of 3.5%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $35.30 million, indicating 26.1% growth from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $30.2 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 7.9%.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $207 million, suggesting a rise of 11.9% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate is $204.7 million, indicating a rise of 10.7%. The consensus mark for investment and other income of $100 million suggests a year-over-year decline of 21.3%. Our estimate for the same is $99.7 million, indicating a decline of 22.7%.The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.37 billion, suggesting a marginal decline from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same is also $3.37 billion, indicating a marginal year-over-year decline.Net Interest Revenues: The overall lending scenario continued to improve in the third quarter. In addition to loan growth, there was a rise in interest rates in the quarter. The Federal Reserve continued with its hawkish monetary policy stance, raising interest rates by another 150 basis points in the quarter. The policy rate reached 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008.Thus, despite the inversion of the yield curve, BNY Mellon’s interest income is expected to have been positively impacted in the quarter, supported by loan growth and higher rates. The consensus mark for NIR for the third quarter is pegged at $841 million, indicating 31.2% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for NIR is $815.1 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 27.2%.Expenses: Because of higher litigation and restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is -0.15%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks That Warrant a LookA couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model, are Morgan Stanley MS and Associated Banc-Corp ASB.The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is +0.59% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The company is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 14.Associated Banc-Corp is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20.

The highly credible solution is devised by integrating the widespread global capabilities of Mastercard with the rich experience of PostePay.The RTP solution seems to reap benefits for both buyers and sellers involved in a transaction. Thanks to RTP, sellers or business owners can send digitized payment requests instantly to pay for a good or service to the buyer. Subsequently, the request reaches the web or the mobile device of a buyer, who on accepting the request, can complete the payments seamlessly via the PostePay App.Consumers can take the liberty to easily pursue a wide array of payments, ranging from online payments, recurring invoice payments comprising bills and taxes to person-to-person (P2P) money transfers. Apart from hassle-free payments, other benefits of the new RTP solution extended to Italian consumers include the provision of a consolidated digital report with which consumers can track their expenditures.As buyers can make payments conveniently, businesses of all sizes can enjoy simplified payments receipt and better management of cashflows by leveraging RTP.Launch of the solution reflects Mastercard’s efforts to boost its solution and application suite, equipping customers with greater ease and power to regulate. Also, the latest move reflects one of the most longstanding endeavors of MA, which is to infuse digitization into the global payments landscape, keeping pace with the ongoing digital trend.Unveiling RTP across Italy at this moment is indicative of Mastercard’s efforts to accelerate digital growth in the country, where businesses and consumers are embracing digital means widely. This enthusiasm is clearly expressed in a proprietary research conducted by MA, wherein 75% of interviewed enterprises and retailers in Italy root for digitalization big time.Story continuesMastercard leverages its solid digital arm built on partnerships with well-established organizations and significant investments to tap the prospects of Italy’s digital payments market.In June 2022, MA partnered with the global payments solution provider Checkout.com and the cryptocurrency exchange Young Platform to introduce Mastercard Send (an innovative personal payments service) across the country.

To skip our analysis of the recent technology trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Big Tech Stocks to Buy Now.Technology has been at the forefront of advancement and innovation in the recent past and is expected to be the primary catalyst in the future as well. The advancements in technology have not only improved the quality of life for individuals but have also resulted in improved productivity and efficiency across almost all aspects of life.According to a report recently published by McKinsey &amp; Company, the latest trends in the technology revolve around 14 major technologies, with clean energy, mobility, and connectivity leading the trends in terms of the investments made during 2021. Clean energy technologies focused on the whole energy value chain, from power generation to storage and distribution, were at the forefront with $257 billion investment last year. Other major trends include applied AI, Cloud, and edge computing, Web3, and immersive reality technologies, among others.The companies picked in this list are at the forefront of their market segments and industries and hold significant competitive advantage over their peers based on strong technological capabilities. The companies have strong fundamentals and have exhibited high growth in the past with the potential to make breakthroughs in the future as well.Despite the growing investments and the increasing importance of technology in our lives, the technology sector and the stocks of the companies that are part of this sector have not fared well in the recent past. The Nasdaq-100 index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, was down year-to-date by nearly 35%, as of October 11, 2022.Global markets have been going through a rough patch with fears of a recession due to inflation and aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks. On September 21, the US central bank raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time and signaled further increases in the future.Story continuesGiven the decline in the market, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading companies across many different sectors and not just technology alone.

The company, which reported better-than-estimated third-quarter net income of NT$280.9 billion ($8.8 billion), is projecting revenue of $19.9 billion to $20.7 billion in the December quarter, though that assumes certain US dollar expectations at a time Asian currencies have weakened.Asia’s semiconductor sector as a whole rose following a rebound in American peers after hot US inflation data. The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index gained as much as 3.6% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed 2.9% higher. TSMC’s stock rose 4.3% in Taipei on Friday.“The time to start buying TSMC stock for absolute upside has now arrived,” JPMorgan analysts said after TSMC’s earnings. Shares had tanked earlier in the week, taking its market capitalization to about $320 billion from more than $550 billion in January.TSMC and its peers are grappling with Washington’s sweeping restrictions on doing business with China, which are sending shock waves through the global semiconductor industry. Applied Materials Inc., a leading producer of chip-making equipment, slashed its forecast for the fourth quarter, while Intel Corp. is said to be preparing to fire thousands. Shares in European gear maker ASML Holding NV, whose top customer is TSMC, fell as much as 3% Thursday.The moves unveiled last week are the Biden administration’s most aggressive yet as it tries to stop China from developing technological capabilities it sees as a threat. The actions, which have incensed Beijing, threaten to disrupt a global economy already dealing with a potential global recession, soaring inflation and lingering supply snarls.Story continues“The company’s 10% cut in full-year capital spending target implies prolonged weakness in smartphone and PC chip demand,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said.Executives said that they won a license from the US to continue operating and building out their 16 nanometer and 28 nanometer lines at Nanjing in China, joining companies from SK Hynix Inc. to Samsung Electronics Co. in securing narrow exemptions to the chip curbs from Washington.The grants allow Asia’s three largest chipmakers to maintain their existing plants and operations in the world’s biggest semiconductor market, for instance by buying, importing and upgrading American tools. They may also be allowed to expand existing facilities covered by the licenses -- which in TSMC’s case involves more mature nodes that are several generations behind state of-the-art. It’s unclear, however, if foreign firms will be allowed to move up the technology ladder, or have American employees working on the lines in China.TSMC to the World: We Have No Good News for You: Tim CulpanThe Biden administration measures limit the ability of companies that use US technology to sell products to China. They include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company.The restrictions make it more difficult for chipmakers to move their inventories and hit TSMC more severely than previous actions by the US, Fubon Research analysts led by Sherman Shang said in a note this week. The curbs mean about 5%-8% of TSMC’s total revenue will likely be restricted, they said. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates TSMC could lose more than 10% of its annual sales because of the restrictions.It’s “too early to provide a specific number, however the inventory correction will likely see its biggest impact sometime in the first half of 2023,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told analysts on a conference call. The impact of the US curbs will be manageable, he said.Still, Taiwan’s largest company is betting on its massive size and industry-leading technology to navigate its biggest challenges in years. Hsinchu, Taiwan-based TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, producing for the likes of Qualcomm Inc., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., all of which sell a significant portion of their products into the Chinese market.On Thursday, executives reaffirmed their long-term targets for revenue and declared 2023 a year of growth. TSMC also pledged to continue expanding around the globe as needed.“TSMC’s guidance of at least 43% year-over-year sales growth and 59.5% gross margin is above consensus estimates, and indicate very mild immediate impact from the new US restrictions,” Shum said.The outlook for the electronics industry had begun to darken even before the upheaval engendered by Biden’s curbs.Macroeconomic shocks have suppressed consumer demand and business spending, while unsold inventory among PC vendors built up. Third-quarter shipments of desktop and laptop computers slumped 15%, according to IDC data, and chip companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have said they were surprised by the speed and sharpness of the downturn in demand. Memory makers Micron Technology Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. have announced cutbacks in output of as much as 30% to try and stabilize prices.TSMC may not be able to rely on sustained demand for products of Apple, its main customer, whose growth has benefited the Taiwanese manufacturer for years.While the California company has launched new types of chips to boost the performance of its devices, it has recently backed off plans to increase production of its new iPhones, raising further questions about underlying electronics demand.(Updates with shares)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJohn Mack, Who Led Morgan Stanley Into a Crisis, Regrets LittleUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages OnMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysHow Gamers Beat NFTsA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold Market©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(Image: Microsoft)Microsoft (MSFT) on Wednesday debuted a slew of new hardware for its Surface line of products, including a new Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and a host of accessibility hardware designed to help users with disabilities more easily access their PCs.All together, the latest Surface products provide a deeper look into Microsoft’s vision for the PC market and Windows operating system. It doesn’t hurt that they also come just ahead of the start of the holiday shopping season.The flagship product in Microsoft’s lineup is the new $999 Surface Pro 9. The company’s laptop-tablet hybrid keeps its built-in kickstand and detachable keyboard, not to mention its 13-inch PixelSense display.Outside, the Surface Pro 9 looks a lot like its predecessor, the Surface Pro 8. But inside, the Pro 9 gets an updated 12th-generation Intel (INTC) Core processor complete with two Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast data transfer and charging. The company says the Intel chip provides a 50% performance boost over last year’s Surface Pro.The Surface Pro 9 gets improved performance via an upgrade Intel chip or more AI capabilities via Microsoft's custom chip. (Image: Microsoft)Microsoft is also offering its new custom Microsoft SQ3 chip with 5G connectivity powered by Qualcomm (QCOM) as an option for the Surface Pro 9, with a heavy focus on battery life and AI capabilities. The company says you can get as much as 19 hours out of a single charge with the SQ3 chip, not to mention a cellular connection when you’re out of WiFi range. Of course, you’ll also get those Thunderbolt 4 ports too.Windows maker also unveiled its latest laptop, the aptly named, Surface Laptop 5. A traditional clamshell laptop, the $999 Surface Laptop 5 is available with a 13.5-inch or 15-inch display and packs Intel’s 12th-generation processors. Like the Surface Pro 9, Microsoft says the chip upgrade improves performance by 50% compared to its predecessor.Then there’s the $4,299 Surface Studio 2+. An all-in-one desktop with a display that folds nearly flat so that you can write or sketch on it, the Studio 2+ is a uniquely designed desktop designed for creators who also want a little bit of gaming on the side.Story continuesThe Microsoft Surface Studio 2+ gets upgraded performance and graphics. (Image: Microsoft)For 2022, the Studio 2+ gets an updated Intel Core H-35 processor, which the company says also gets 50% faster CPU performance and an NVIDIA (NVDA) GeForce RTX 3060 graphics chip that offers double the video capabilities. The Studio 2+ also gets Thunderbolt 4 ports, and an upgraded camera and microphone setup.Finally, Microsoft has announced that it’s bringing its Adaptive Accessories to market. Beginning on Oct. 25 in select markets, the accessories allow users with limited mobility to access their Windows PC without issue, whether that’s via specially designed joysticks or directional buttons.The lineup looks as exceptional as always, but they come at a time when the PC market is falling back down to Earth from its pandemic-level highs. According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments collapsed 19.5% in Q3 to 68 million units.And while the holidays are a traditionally popular time for PC sales, this year could be especially tough as stubborn inflation batters consumers’ wallets.Microsoft CVP Yusuf Mehdi, however, says there are signs that the jump in PC usage, at least, isn’t going away.“We’ve seen 10% more minutes on each PC pre-pandemic versus post-pandemic, and that’s driven by a whole bunch of new…use cases,” he said. “We have 300 million more people using new apps for communications like Discord and WeChat, WhatsApp, and, of course, gaming... We’ve just seen the PC have more value for people.”Whether the Surface line is able to overcome current market trends and hit a successful holiday season, remains to be seen.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanGoogle debuts Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro with big camera changesElon Musk agrees to go ahead with $44 billion Twitter dealTech’s ugly quarter will bleed into OctoberGot a tip?

How has Expedia Group navigated this new global landscape and what are you most proud of?I'm proud of our nearly 14,000 Expedians who supported our travelers, partners, and destinations, all while dealing with personal and professional responsibilities and the stress of the pandemic. Our mission for travel to serve as a force for good was truly put to the test, but our employees fully embraced it as a rallying cry throughout.The pandemic impacted how we work, how we socialize, and of course, how we travel. In 2021, as the world started to reopen, the travel industry, much like all of us, began to navigate a new version of normal, and Expedia Group was ready to rebound. After all, we bring people together; that's what gets us up in the morning and keeps us going.Q: How is Expedia Group helping advance a more sustainable travel industry?Our collective industry must recognize that we impact the environment with every travel experience we sell. At the same time, travel is one of the biggest economic drivers for many communities throughout the world; we must ensure the future of travel for generations to come.As travelers are increasingly shopping their values, they are turning to our platform for inspiration and guidance, and we will be ready to meet this desire for greener, more responsible choices. We're committed to working together with our partners and peers to ensure the industry can fulfill the scientific imperative of Net Zero by 2050. This commitment encompasses our initiatives with the UNWTO and the UNESCO Sustainable Travel Pledge, among others, to accelerate sustainability in the travel industry. And we've already started at home with our LEED Gold Certified Seattle headquarters and the purchase of renewable electricity to power our offices worldwide.Story continuesQ: How is Expedia Group ensuring a more inclusive travel experience for all travelers?Our travelers are diverse, with an array of interests and needs. As we work to unlock the full potential of travel, we're focused on creating personalized experiences that exceed each traveler's unique expectations. Our teams across Expedia Group are doing everything we can to make travel more equitable and accessible for everyone regardless of their identity. With our scale and reach, no one is more equipped to tackle this than we are.Whether it's our Expedia Brands spotlighting LGBTQIA+- welcoming hotels or Expedia Group lobbying for inclusive passport designations, we're weaving inclusion in from the beginning. Starting with more inclusive search filters and booking experiences - no matter how travelers identify, where they want to go, or what they want to do when they get there - we're leveraging our platform to empower travelers to build experiences that are as diverse as they are.Q: What's next for Expedia Group?One thing became apparent over the past two years - the people who power the travel industry are incredibly courageous, strong, and resilient. The distancing that COVID-19 required of us only emphasized how important it is for us to get it right, and ensure travel is responsible, inclusive, and accessible to all. We're also seeing travel trends shift, and travelers seeking experiences that offer more than just relaxation or exploration. We're continuing to find ways to build traveler experiences that align to these needs, enhancing the visibility travelers have into their environmental and community impact. As travel comes back, Expedia Group is ready to lead the way to a stronger and more responsible future. This is how we will succeed as a company and an industry.OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL SOCIAL IMPACT &amp; SUSTAINABILITY - ADITI MOHAPATRAFriends,This past year has been one of global rebuilding. At Expedia Group, we've spent this time thinking about who we are and what kind of company we want to be, the state of the world and what role we play. As Expedia Group's first Vice President of Global Social Impact &amp; Sustainability, I'm impressed with our work to date and eager to build on it, to ensure Expedia Group tackles what lies ahead. In creating this role, Expedia Group is making a commitment to shaping a more inclusive, equitable, safe, and sustainable travel industry for generations to come.Expedia Group has long been committed to making travel more responsible and accessible for all travelers. We're extending this tradition by leveraging the tools at our disposal - our platform, data, expertise, business, and community partnerships - to create outcomes that showcase our mission of travel as a force for good. More than that, we're using our unique position to bring others along with us, working closely with our partners and communities around the globe to advance traveler equity and integrate sustainable operations into our business models and offerings.Travelers want trips with purpose from brands with integrity, which is why we're building strategic partnerships that allow people to make choices that fit with their values and needs. As an example, eco- conscious travelers using our platform will soon be able to book trips with comparatively lower emissions and enhanced sustainability. And we're just as focused on addressing traveler equity - delivering better information and working with hotels and partners that embed inclusivity into their offerings so, together, we can break down barriers.We've built a strong foundation and now we're ready to take it to the next level with the launch of our new global impact strategy. Our new direction will focus on three main priorities: economic advancement, barriers to access, and sustainable travel solutions. We believe Expedia Group is well-positioned to address the multi- faceted challenges facing the travel industry and deliver long-lasting impact for our stakeholders.One of our company's core values - Go Get What's Next - is particularly inspiring to me. It's all about seeing the potential of where our industry could go and taking every opportunity to drive travel toward a better, more sustainable and responsible future. I'm excited to have joined Expedia Group at a pivotal moment and am ready to bring our new direction to life as we move into this next ambitious chapter.View the full Expedia Group 2021 Global Impact Report.

Earnings and revenues increased 19.7% and 18% from the year-ago figures, respectively. Fastenal’s earnings topped the consensus mark in the last four quarters, with the average being 4%.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has remained unchanged at 48 cents over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates 14.3% growth from the year-ago level. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.79 billion, suggesting a 14.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $1.55 billion.Fastenal Company Price and EPS SurpriseFastenal Company Price and EPS SurpriseFastenal Company price-eps-surprise | Fastenal Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteSales: Higher manufacturing and non-residential construction demand are expected to have generated higher sales on a year-over-year basis (although at a moderate level) for this national wholesale distributor of industrial and construction supplies.If we go by the latest monthly sales report, August’s average daily sales grew 16.1% to $28 million, moderating sequentially. In July 2022, daily sales registered 18.1% growth, whereas the same had witnessed 9% growth in August 2021.The company has been navigating well through issues like price inflation, supply chain challenges and a shortage of labor. It has been gaining from all product categories, end markets and customers.In terms of end markets/products/customers, in August and July, manufacturing sales improved 23.5% and 22.7% from the respective year-ago months. Non-residential construction grew 5.8% and 8.8% for August and July 2022, respectively.Fastener sales were up 19.8% in August (compared with a 19.8% increase in July 2022). Safety sales increased 11.7% in August compared with 13.6% growth in July. In terms of customer channel, national accounts were up 20% year over year in August (compared with a 23% increase in July), while non-national accounts grew 10% (compared with a 12% rise in July 2022).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s overall daily sales is pegged at $27.9 million, which indicates an increase from $27.8 million reported in the prior quarter and $24.3 million a year ago.Margins: Inflationary pressure has been a cause of concern. The company highlighted that it has been experiencing significant material cost inflation, particularly for steel, fuel and transportation. The company has been experiencing the adverse effects of tightening global and domestic supply chains.However, Fastenal has been successfully raising prices to offset inflationary pressure. The company has been undertaking additional steps to counter cost pressure and incremental tariffs, which are expected to reflect on the bottom line.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FAST this time around.

176,d8fe824d-ea07-3fdf-9538-5af1d49c5393,PHM,2022-10-13,"Why PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pultegroup-inc-nyse-phm-130056708.html,1665579656,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$45.91 and falling to the lows of US$37.50. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether PulteGroup's current trading price of US$39.95 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at PulteGroup’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup Is PulteGroup Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, PulteGroup seems to be fairly priced at around 4.33% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy PulteGroup today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $38.29, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because PulteGroup’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from PulteGroup?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of PulteGroup, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PHM’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PHM, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing PulteGroup at this point in time. While conducting our analysis, we found that PulteGroup has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.If you are no longer interested in PulteGroup, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

177,f7de3ad4-2462-303a-969f-6802f5b97b12,BAX,2022-10-13,3 Reasons to Retain Baxter (BAX) Stock in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-retain-baxter-bax-162904502.html,1665592144,STORY,"['BAX', 'MCK']","[Baxter International Inc. BAX is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by a strong product portfolio. The robust revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022 on the back of a strong acute therapies profile is expected to contribute further. However, generic competition for cyclophosphamide and a sluggish macroeconomic environment is worrying.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 35% compared with a 47.7% decline of the industry and a 24.8% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical technology company has a market capitalization of $27.69 billion. The company projects 7.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Acute Therapies Profile: We are upbeat about Baxter’s performance in acute therapies, which has been continuously driven by improving utilization for continuous renal replacement (“CRRT”) globally and increased demand for multi-organ support products. In acute therapies, Baxter offers the first three-in-one oXIRIS set for CRRT therapy and sepsis management protocols.The company has been witnessing tremendous demand for many products, which include its PrisMax and Prismaflex control units (monitors).Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Baxter’s impressive product portfolio that boasts improved existing products and new product development. Management announced plans to introduce therapies and products that can be expected to further contribute to sales by 2023. Baxter’s product pipeline is witnessing the addition of generic injectables and the next generation of its premix technology, among other notable mentions.During the first quarter of 2022, Baxter announced its initial investments in nine start-ups participating in the mHUB Accelerator — the largest and fastest-growing physical product innovation center in the United States. Last month, Baxter announced the receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its new Novum IQ syringe infusion pump (SYR) with Dose IQ Safety Software. The company expects to introduce the Novum IQ platform in the global markets to continue delivering a strong and streamlined experience for customers, subject to the receipt of necessary approvals.Story continuesStrong Topline Growth in Q2: Baxter’s solid second-quarter 2022 results at constant currency buoy optimism. The company witnessed strong performance across four of its business units. Growth in the Americas is encouraging. However, contraction in both gross and operating margins is a concern.DownsidesSluggish Macroeconomic Environment: Baxter depends on the European Union for about a third of its sales. This is a cause of concern, given the sluggish macroeconomic environment, a glum outlook for hospital spending and the tightening of reimbursements. The outlook also remains slightly uneasy in the United States, where demand for many healthcare products is soft, with an expectation of further price cuts on account of healthcare reforms.Generic Competition for Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment. Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance has lacked luster for the better part of the last five years. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. Despite a promising portfolio, the company has failed to grab significant market share and substantially grow its top line, thanks to generic competition.Estimate TrendBaxter is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 12.1% south to $3.63.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.78 billion, suggesting a 17.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Baxter International Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the REIT sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Dividend Stocks. Over the years, the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector in the US expanded into a wide range of diverse assets. In 2021, the sector performed well after recovering from the ills of the pandemic a year before. Morgan Stanley mentioned in a report that global listed real estate markets returned 27.2% in 2021, citing data from FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. In addition to this, the REIT sector also contributes significantly to the national GDP. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the sector generates nearly $197 billion in labor income through 3 million jobs. Moreover, the REITs in the US own real estate assets worth over $3.5 trillion.The sector is increasingly becoming popular among investors as it offers relatively high dividend yields, which is rewarding in times of financial instability. From 2015 to 2020, the average dividend yield of the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index was 3.7%, compared with a 2% average yield of the S&amp;P 500, as reported by S&amp;P Global. Besides offering high yields, these companies earn stable streams of income from long-tenant leases and also distribute 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, distributed dividends and interest payments supported $26.1 billion in labor income during the second quarter of 2022. The report also mentioned that the sector distributed dividends worth over $92.3 billion in 2021.Over the years, the returns of the REIT sector are also worth noticing as it outperformed its peers. As reported by CBRE Investment Management, US REITs delivered an average annual return of 10.8% in the last 20 years ending November 2021. In comparison, other global equities returned 6.8% during the same period. This year, dividend stocks like PepsiCo, Inc.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$6.3b after the stock price dropped 5.6% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic Medtronic Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; President of Medical Surgical Portfolio, Robert White, for US$737k worth of shares, at about US$102 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$80.31. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Medtronic shares, than buying.

It is worth considering Goodyear (GT), which belongs to the Zacks Rubber - Tires industry.This tire maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 56.27%.For the last reported quarter, Goodyear came out with earnings of $0.46 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43 per share, representing a surprise of 6.98%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.37 per share, delivering a surprise of 105.56%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Goodyear lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Goodyear currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In 2021, the sector performed well after recovering from the ills of the pandemic a year before. Morgan Stanley mentioned in a report that global listed real estate markets returned 27.2% in 2021, citing data from FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. In addition to this, the REIT sector also contributes significantly to the national GDP. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the sector generates nearly $197 billion in labor income through 3 million jobs. Moreover, the REITs in the US own real estate assets worth over $3.5 trillion.The sector is increasingly becoming popular among investors as it offers relatively high dividend yields, which is rewarding in times of financial instability. From 2015 to 2020, the average dividend yield of the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index was 3.7%, compared with a 2% average yield of the S&amp;P 500, as reported by S&amp;P Global. Besides offering high yields, these companies earn stable streams of income from long-tenant leases and also distribute 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, distributed dividends and interest payments supported $26.1 billion in labor income during the second quarter of 2022. The report also mentioned that the sector distributed dividends worth over $92.3 billion in 2021.Over the years, the returns of the REIT sector are also worth noticing as it outperformed its peers. As reported by CBRE Investment Management, US REITs delivered an average annual return of 10.8% in the last 20 years ending November 2021. In comparison, other global equities returned 6.8% during the same period. This year, dividend stocks like PepsiCo, Inc.

Now, Merck will pay Moderna $250 million for the collaboration, including joint development and future commercialization.Now, Wall Street's viewing this as a big win ahead of the clinical trial results that we are expecting before the end of the year. You can see the pop in the stock today. But this is not the only catalyst for Moderna. The FDA also granting emergency use authorization for its Omicron booster vaccine for children as young as six years old. So two stories here, very bullish for Moderna here, and we're seeing the stock pop mostly on the Merck cancer news, but still, a big move to the upside.DAVE BRIGGS: I was about to say, I think for the most part, the upside of the Omicron or any of the COVID vaccines has pretty much worn off. We are pretty much over it and flipped the page. But it is that younger portion where there are some people that have not had their kids vaccinated. But this Keytruda is key because you've heard so many questions, Moderna. What now? What have you done for me lately? You printed money for two years. What's the next plan? And this is finally a glimpse into that. Keytruda Merck's second biggest drug, 35% of their sales in the most recent quarter.]"

She cited how Boeing cut the development time of the T-7 trainer jet by 80% to three years as an example of what might be possible for commercial airplanes.Still, Doniz declined to offer a target date for when Boeing will design its next major plane digitally, a goal the company has discussed for years. Boeing has a commercial-order backlog of 4,354 aircraft.Some employees expressed reluctance over tools Boeing offered to help them, too. The company deployed the HoloLens, mixed-reality headsets from Microsoft Corp, so staff could wire aircraft with manuals before them digitally. The first-generation goggles had trouble with certain lighting conditions, and they were an adjustment for some, she said.""There's a bit of a learning curve,"" she said.Virtual reality is still nascent. The metaverse, not just a place where Boeing may one day build its planes, is a concept where people can have an avatar in vast virtual lands. There even is discussion about creating ""digital twins"" of the real world -- and its problems, said Morgan McGuire, Roblox's chief scientist.""There's a lot of things in the real world that are really serious and are really bad,"" McGuire said at the conference. ""I don't want the haves and have nots. I don't want -- what's the digital equivalent of homelessness?""Roblox's success attracting nearly 60 million daily users to play and build games on its site has not found a match however in Tinder, the Match Group Inc dating app that's taking a wait-and-see approach to the metaverse.Story continues""We aren’t doing anything explicitly in the metaverse today, but we want to be the place you go when you want to meet somebody new, whether that is in the real world or the virtual world,"" Tinder Chief Operating Officer Faye Iosotaluno said at the conference.Part of the challenge may be the technology is rudimentary. In the view of Renji Bijoy, chief executive of the virtual office company Immersed speaking at the Reuters conference Wednesday, ""this is more (like) Windows 95,"" he said.(Reporting By Dawn Chmielewski and Jeffrey Dastin in Austin; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)]"

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $27 million, the contract is expected to get completed by April 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be responsible for installing the data transfer unit and Defensive Electronic Countermeasure System Replacement Phase III ARC-210 components into the CH-53K aircraft.The company will also be engaged in providing support flight planning and testing of the components and supportability products. A major portion of the work will be executed in Stratford, CT and Patuxent River, MD.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also bear expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems.

The collaboration will evaluate whether a combined framework of these technologies can increase the yield and confidence of target discovery to find promising drugs based on human omics insights.""Illumina and AstraZeneca are uniquely positioned to improve the efficiency of pharma pipelines by leveraging industry-leading abilities to identify genetic variants that contribute to human disease,"" said Joydeep Goswami, chief strategy and corporate development officer, interim chief financial officer at Illumina. ""By identifying genes that show evidence of human disease causality, the combined framework has the potential to prioritize drug candidates with increased likelihood of approval.""The collaboration leverages Illumina's next generation of AI-based interpretation tools, PrimateAI and SpliceAI, in combination with AstraZeneca's analysis framework for rare variant genomic discoveries-alongside the latter's own AI tools, including JARVIS and in silico predictors like missense tolerance ratio. As part of the research collaboration a framework combining the two companies' AI-based tools will be adopted by AstraZeneca's Centre for Genomics Research to analyze large-scale multi-omics data sets in its digital biobank. The complementary AI tools work to more confidently pinpoint genetic variants that contribute to human diseases, a critical step in the process of developing effective and safe therapies.Slavé Petrovski, head of AstraZeneca's Centre for Genomics Research, Discovery Sciences, R&amp;D, said: ""Continuous innovation in the AI tools and frameworks that are applied to the growing human genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics medical research resources will enable us to answer some of the toughest questions and contribute to our aims of uncovering novel drug targets with a higher probability of success while also characterizing patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit from the treatments we discover.""Story continues""The next generation of drug discovery lies at the intersection of human genetics and AI, making this a potentially pivotal research collaboration that combines Illumina's industry-leading ability to interpret genomes at scale with AstraZeneca's extensive capabilities in large-scale human genetics research,"" said Alex Aravanis, chief technology officer of Illumina.The research collaboration focuses on the ability of a combined framework to deliver differential performance across a broad range of human diseases.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $27 million, the contract is expected to get completed by April 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be responsible for installing the data transfer unit and Defensive Electronic Countermeasure System Replacement Phase III ARC-210 components into the CH-53K aircraft.The company will also be engaged in providing support flight planning and testing of the components and supportability products. A major portion of the work will be executed in Stratford, CT and Patuxent River, MD.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also bear expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%.

The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.The buyout will aid ANSYS to bolster its position in the simulation solutions market, especially in the lucrative Aerospace as well as defense and private space industry verticals. C&amp;R Technologies offers a thermal-centric modeling approach that provides quick and effective system-level simulation capabilities. These, when combined with ANSYS’ physical solvers, will provide customers with enhanced fidelity through every stage of thermal system design and optimization for a variety of applications.C&amp;R Technologies portfolio of solutions is complementary to ANSYS’ suite of 3D thermal, fluid flow, and mission simulation tools.

218,51eef02d-0cc2-34a3-8937-ffde8e2c6989,ZION,2022-10-13,Central Valley Community Bancorp (CVCY) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/central-valley-community-bancorp-cvcy-140002287.html,1665583202,STORY,"['CVCY', 'ZIONP']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Central Valley Community Bancorp (CVCY) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Central Valley Community Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13%.Revenues are expected to be $21.9 million, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Central Valley Community Bancorp?For Central Valley Community Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.04%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Central Valley Community Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Central Valley Community Bancorp would post earnings of $0.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of +7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Central Valley Community Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - West industry, Zions (ZION), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $812.72 million, up 15.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Zions has been revised 0.5% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.06%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Zions will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bank's $11.69 billion profit at the time would have been $9.59 billion without the $2.1 in reserve releases.With expectations a recession is underway, inflation still persistently high, and savings accounts that were buoyed by fiscal stimulus checks dwindling, banks are preparing a line of defense in case some customers can't pay up on loans.""It's very much banks taking a slightly more conservative approach,"" Jackson explained. ""Just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession in 2023, so I think banks just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that.""Story continuesAmong those market participants is JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, who said earlier this week that the economy may be in a recession by mid-next year.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon testifies during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill September 22, 2022. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)And over the last few months, Dimon has highlighted headwinds such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, deteriorating consumer confidence, and “never-before-seen quantitative tightening.""""These are very, very serious things which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world — I mean, Europe is already in recession — and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now,"" Dimon said Monday in an interview with CNBC.JPMorgan set aside $428 million for loan loss reserves in the second quarter and $902 million in such funds during the first quarter, according to earnings statements.JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with financials from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) due out next week.—Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

As always, it’s being led off by the big banks.But the banks are still in the doghouse. 14 years after the start of the financial crisis, the banks are still out of favor on Wall Street. This year, most banks stocks are down big, with many at 52-week lows.But are things really that bad? The Federal Reserve is raising rates which should help bank earnings. But the mortgage market has slowed sharply. Some banks will see a big hit to earnings as this part of their business remains slow.And the Street believes that a recession is certainly coming, which will hit bank earnings. Or will it?But the banks are now, as a group, cheap. They have low P/Es and P/B ratios. Some pay dividends over 5%. Others are doing share buybacks.Are the big banks a deal as they hit new lows?5 Big Bank Earnings Charts to Watch This Week1.    JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPMJPMorgan Chase is one of the banks everyone watches each quarter. Led by CEO Jamie Dimon, it’s seen as a bellwether.

Should investors have it on their short list too?5.    PNC Financial PNCPNC Financial is a big regional bank headquartered in Pittsburgh.

The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have declined year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on disappointing non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business.Over the trailing four quarters, Wells Fargo’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate on three occasions and missed on the other, the surprise being 11.24%, on average.Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS SurpriseWells Fargo &amp; Company price-eps-surprise | Wells Fargo &amp; Company QuoteLet’s now look at the other factors that are expected to have influenced Wells Fargo’s third-quarter earnings.Loans and Net Interest Income (NII): While lending activity improved sequentially in the third quarter, the pace of loan growth across most categories slowed as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderated in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the quarter under review.Also, in the third quarter, the Fed hiked interest rates by 150 basis points, resulting in a policy rate of 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. Hence, decent loan growth and interest rate hikes are likely to have driven the bank’s earnings asset yields, margin and NII in the quarter.Amid the considerations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s NII is pegged at $11.57 billion, suggesting a 13.5% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Mortgage Banking Revenues: Mortgage originations, both purchase and refinancing, continued to decline in the third quarter. Mortgage banking revenues have been facing tough comps from the prior year that was propelled by low mortgage rates.However, in the third quarter, mortgage rates increased, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossing the 6% mark in September. The climb in mortgage rates has led to a smaller origination market. Hence, being one of the largest bank mortgage lenders in the United States, the company is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $292 million for the third quarter, suggesting a 1.7% rise from the prior quarter’s reported number.Overall Non-Interest Revenues:Wells Fargo’s investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of the lag effect from weaker equity and fixed-income market performance in the second quarter. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activity are expected to have been headwinds in the third quarter. The consensus mark for trading revenues is pegged at $2.17 billion, implying a sequential decrease of 7.4%.The company is expected to see lower deposit-related fees, reflecting the implementation of overdraft policy changes and fee waivers.Raging inflation, equity market rout and fears of recession resulted in disappointing equity market performance. Thus, the IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up. Also, bond issuances are likely to have been muted. While global deal-making hit a record low for the third consecutive quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to have fared decently on the mergers and acquisitions front. Accordingly, the consensus mark for investment banking fees is pegged at $412 million, implying a sequential increase of 44%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s total fee income is pegged at $7.17 billion for the third quarter, suggesting a 5.1% rise from the prior quarter’s reported number.Expenses: Wells Fargo’s costs are expected to have continued to flare up in the third quarter, given its franchise investments in technology, digitalization efforts and the announced settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor related to its 401(k) plan contributions. Additionally, amid the rising inflation, salary expenses are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is expected to have hindered bottom-line growth in the third quarter.Asset Quality: With loan growth, expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook and growing recession risk, Wells Fargo is expected to have continued building reserves in the third quarter. The provision for credit losses was $680 million in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing assets of $6.67 billion implies a 9.6% increase sequentially.What Our Model PredictsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for WFC this time around. This is because Wells Fargo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is -0.62%.Zacks Rank: Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221010005742/en/A 30-µg booster dose of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine demonstrated a substantial increase in the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing antibody response above pre-booster levels based on sera taken 7 days after administration, with similar responses seen across individuals aged 18 to 55 years of age and those older than 55 years of age (40 participants in each age group). When comparing responses in individuals older than 55 years of age who received either the bivalent vaccine, or the original vaccine, a 30-µg booster dose of the Original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (also referred to as BNT162b2 Wild Type) elicited more limited increases in the neutralizing antibody response against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variants. COVID-19 vaccine responses to date have reliably shown consistent trends across age groups and are further supported by these early data on the bivalent vaccine. Together, these data suggest a 30-µg booster dose of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine is anticipated to provide better protection against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variants than the original vaccine for younger and older adults. The Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine was well tolerated with early data indicating a favorable safety profile, similar to that of the original vaccine.Story continues""Since the earliest days of the pandemic, we have strived to transparently share data regarding our COVID-19 vaccines in the interest of public health,"" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. ""While we expect more mature immune response data from the clinical trial of our Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in the coming weeks, we are pleased to see encouraging responses just one week after vaccination in younger and older adults. These early data suggest that our bivalent vaccine is anticipated to provide better protection against currently circulating variants than the original vaccine and potentially help to curb future surges in cases this winter.""""These preliminary findings are consistent with our preclinical data showing a substantial increase in the neutralizing antibody response against the Omicron sublineages BA.4 and BA.5,"" said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. ""The current dominance of BA.4/BA.5 and related sublineages, underscores the importance of our data and science-based approach to develop a vaccine which is adapted to these prevalent strains of the virus and make it available in a timely manner.""Immunogenicity was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 live virus fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT) assay. Sera were collected 7 days post second booster dose from participants aged older than 55 (40 participants in each age group) and compared to 7-day post sera from 40 participants older than 55 years of age that had received three prior doses of BNT162b2 encoding the wild-type spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a second booster with BNT162b2 Wild-Type. Sera were also collected at 7 days post second booster dose from participants 18 to 55 years of age who received the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent booster (n=40) to compare bivalent vaccine responses in younger and older adults. The time between third and fourth doses for the bivalent vaccine recipients was approximately 11 months compared to approximately 6 months for the original vaccine. Despite this difference, baseline neutralizing antibody response was generally similar across groups. Among the participants, samples were equally stratified at baseline in each group between those who had a prior or current history of SARS-CoV-2 and those with no prior or current history of SARS-CoV-2.Additional data measuring responses at one-month post-administration of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent vaccine booster are expected in the coming weeks. These data will be used to support potential full licensure and global registration of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, the companies have initiated a similar Phase 1/2/3 trial (NCT05543616) investigating the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine among children 6 months through 11 years of age.A 30-µg booster dose of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ages 12 years and older and has also been granted marketing authorization in the EU by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the same age group.The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines (COMIRNATY®), which are based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, were developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 Wild Type and BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.About the Phase 2/3 StudyThis multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 2/3 trial (NCT05472038) has enrolled about 900 healthy volunteers 12 years of age and older in the U.S. who have received at least three doses of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine. During the trial, participants aged 18 and older received either a 30-µg or 60-µg booster dose of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted COVID-19 vaccine and participants aged 12 through 17 years received a 30-µg booster of the same vaccine. Comparisons to support potential full licensure and registrations globally will be made with a control group who previously received a fourth dose with the original vaccine.U.S. INDICATION &amp; AUTHORIZED USEPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original And Omicron BA.4/BA.5)AUTHORIZED USEPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) is FDA-authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 12 years of age and older as a single booster dose administered at least 2 months after either:completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent* COVID-19 vaccine; orreceipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.*Monovalent refers to any authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccine that contains or encodes the spike protein of only the Original SARS-CoV-2 virusCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)INDICATIONCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.AUTHORIZED USEPrimary Seriesa third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have certain kinds of immunocompromisePfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineAUTHORIZED USESPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 6 months and older to provide:Primary Seriesa 3-dose primary series to individuals 6 months through 4 years of agea 2-dose primary series to individuals 5 years through 11 years of agea third primary series dose to individuals 5 years through 11 years of age with certain kinds of immunocompromisea single booster dose to individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have completed a primary series with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineEMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATIONEmergency uses of the vaccines have not been approved or licensed by FDA but have been authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals aged 6 months and older for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 12 years and older for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent.

Regulatory submissions are planned later this year.If approved, Jefferies analysts have forecast $2.5 billion in global RSV vaccine peak sales in older adults for GSK.GSK said in June the trial had yielded statistically significant results for the shot, but on Thursday gave details about the performance of the vaccine.U.S. drugmaker Pfizer in August disclosed positive Phase III data on its rival RSV vaccine in older adults.Efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with two or more symptoms was 66.7%, while efficacy against severe disease defined by three or more symptoms was 85.7%, the company said.Given different definitions of the trial endpoints across the GSK and Pfizer studies, a direct comparison of efficacy is difficult, Morgan Stanley analysts said on Thursday.Story continues""That said, the GSK data do look strong relative to that presented by Pfizer,"" they added.In trial participants with pre-existing conditions, the GSK vaccine was shown to be 94.6% effective, while in adults aged 70 to 79 it was 93.8% effective, the company said.The performance of Pfizer's vaccine across key subgroups, possible differences in safety and tolerability between the GSK and Pfizer shot, as well as any early signs of how durable the protection for either shot is, will be the key focus of presentations from both drugmakers at a medical conference next week, Jefferies analysts said.A late-stage readout on Johnson &amp; Johnson's RSV vaccine in older adults is also expected by the end of 2022, while an interim look at Moderna's rival shot's Phase III data is also anticipated this winter.

We'll use ROE to examine International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:29% = US$5.6b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.29.Does International Business Machines Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the IT industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for International Business Machines visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 29% Return On EquityInternational Business Machines does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.58. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

240,22b4ca55-1d4f-35d9-b521-b87c42186244,IBM,2022-10-13,Analysts Estimate IBM (IBM) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-ibm-ibm-report-140002070.html,1665583202,STORY,['IBM'],"[The market expects IBM (IBM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.4%.Revenues are expected to be $13.75 billion, down 22% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM?For IBM, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that IBM will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that IBM would post earnings of $2.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.31, delivering a surprise of +0.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.IBM doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

241,35330ee2-9fa6-32e8-9adf-37b83803395b,MPC,2022-10-13,Investors Heavily Search Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-marathon-petroleum-130001522.html,1665579601,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned +5.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has lost 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $6.77 per share, indicating a change of +827.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +9.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.26 points to a change of +808.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.35 indicates a change of -40% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Petroleum is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $166.39 billion and $144.08 billion estimates indicate +37.6% and -13.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $54.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.8%. EPS of $10.61 for the same period compares with $0.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +63.08%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, a leading player in the residential space is making a big move. SunPower announcing a major tie up with General Motors to develop new home energy systems. That's going to coincide with the retail launch of the Chevy Silverado EV in 2024.Let's bring in the CEO of SunPower, Peter Faricy joining us live on the show today. Peter, good to talk to you today. Certainly a big announcement here that really combines the battery side of things, the solar side of things, EVs. Talk to me about how this-- it's all connected through the new home energy system.PETER FARICY: Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me on. But we are just thrilled to partner with General Motors. As you mentioned, our partnership has two major components that are going to be critical for the future of EV sales and for clean energy. So number one, we're preferred partner for General Motors on electric vehicle charger installations. So for all the electric vehicles they sell going forward, we'll be their preferred partner. And many customers find that it's very-- this is not a do-it-yourself job. You need someone's help to set up your own home charging station, if you will.But secondly, once you get an electric vehicle, you quickly discover your home charging station is using a lot more energy than it used to. And so most customers want solar power very quickly afterwards. And we are the exclusive partner for General Motors on solar panels and batteries. And we're just thrilled to work together on changing the world as we go forward.AKIKO FUJITA: So you're talking about installing the solar panels on homes that are looking to get the charging installed for their GM car.Story continuesPETER FARICY: Exactly. So once you buy an electric vehicle, obviously, there's so many wonderful parts about it. You don't use fossil fuel at the gas station. But if you just plug in to your garage, and you don't have solar power, you're just connecting to usually coal or gas or whatever fossil fuel the local utility uses. So you're only as green as your charging source. And so most EV customers really want solar power quickly afterwards because their bills are much higher when they go to charge their car without solar power. And with solar power, they have this clean, renewable energy source forever.AKIKO FUJITA: Peter, one of the big concerns with EVs has been just how it's likely to strain the power grid and this idea of bidirectional charging, using your car to power up your home, certainly one that's been picking up a lot of steam. How much of that demand that's anticipated for the power grid do you think can actually be picked up by these EVs?PETER FARICY: Well, you're absolutely right. Bi-directional chargers, wow, this is really going to change the world for consumers. Who would have thought that in addition to backing up your home with a generator, that's the way it's been done traditionally that you can either use a solar battery or actually use your vehicle. And what General Motors has announced is that we will be installing their bidirectional charger for the 2024 Silverado pickup launch. It launches at the end of '23 next year.And what's exciting is that for consumers who buy a Silverado, they'll have the option to back up their home with their vehicle battery, which will just be incredible. But you're absolutely right. The grid today doesn't have enough capacity for all the future EV sales that we expect. General Motors is expecting to sell more than a million electric vehicles in the next three years. If you believe the data by 2030, 30 million more electric vehicles will be out there on the road.And so for practical purposes and obviously to combat climate change, more and more consumers are going to want solar power. And we're really excited to work with them because we're the number one rated residential solar power company in the United States. We have the highest customer service. We have the best products. And we're thrilled to work with GM to serve their customers.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, certainly the idea of bidirectional charging really picking up steam, especially in light of recent natural disasters like the hurricanes, fires with a lot of homeowners saying, well, this sort of could have helped with the power outages. Obviously GM came out with this announcement yesterday, certainly big news. But your stock was down significantly because of a downgrade from Bank of America specifically citing a decline in new home sales affecting revenue outlook. I realize sales from homes aren't specifically the biggest revenue driver for SunPower. But how big of a pullback do you anticipate? And to what extent have you already seen that?PETER FARICY: Well, we are the leader in new home solar. So I recognize the origin of the comment. But what I'll tell you is that overall demand for solar outside of new homes has been so high this year that any change in new homes demand really hasn't been material to our business. So we have a very big backlog of new homes that exist today that are waiting for solar. That will carry us through most of 2023.So although new home starts have slowed because of rising interest rates, I don't anticipate it's going to have much of an impact on our overall business. We announced that we haven't announced our third quarter results yet obviously. But in Q1 and Q2, we actually announced accelerating demand. And this year just to give you some color has just been terrific from a demand standpoint. More and more consumers want solar power. And we're so excited to work with them on it.AKIKO FUJITA: SunPower CEO Peter Faricy. Good to have you on air today, really appreciate the time.PETER FARICY: Thank you again.]"

Applications will range from bi-directional charging, vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, stationary storage, solar products, software applications, cloud management tools, microgrid solutions, hydrogen fuel cells and more. The services will also allow the sale of energy from EV and stationary storage batteries back to utilities during peak consumption periods.Much of the above-mentioned technology will become available to consumers through Ultium Home, which is the residential-focused section of GM Energy.The interface for GM Energy's solutions will be GM's Energy Services Cloud, equipped with data and energy management tools, building a holistic connection between residential, fleet and commercial energy assets for customers.Many large-scale companies across the United States are working with GM Energy to provide energy services. Some of them are Con Edison, Graniterock and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative. Among them is a partnership with SunPower, one of the leading solar technology providers in the country. The two companies will co-develop and offer customers integrated solar energy-powered systems in homes with EV and battery solutions, solar panels and home energy storage. The home energy framework seeks to enable drivers to power their homes with the battery in their EVs. This unlocks the scope of powering homes during times of necessity.  Moreover, SunPower will become a preferred installer for the home energy system and offer the scope to add solar power to their homes. The home energy system will be available alongside the retail launch of the upcoming 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, which is slated to begin production in fall 2023. GM expects all of the new Ultium Home and Commercial products to go into production in fourth-quarter 2023.To put to use the feature of powering homes through EVs, GM has initiated a V2H pilot project between GM Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&amp;E”). After initial trial runs, the two companies expect to expand the V2H offer to a subset of residential customers within PG&amp;E's service area, expected to begin in 2023.Also, as part of GM Energy, Ultium Charge 360 will continue to expand its existing public charging networks, integrated mobile apps, and additional product and service offerings over time.In another development to its charging capabilities, General Motors recently secured a new source of cost-competitive nickel and cobalt for Ultium battery cells with a strategic investment in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia. The nickel processing will be carried out in a manner that will reduce waste with no requirement for a tailings dam. Per the agreement, GM is expected to invest up to $69 million in Queensland Pacific Metals to develop its proposed Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub Project in Northern Australia.The nickel and cobalt extracted will power a broad portfolio of trucks, SUVs, vans and luxury vehicles of GM, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV.The collaboration with Queensland Pacific Metals will provide GM with a secure, cost-competitive and long-term supply of nickel and cobalt from a free-trade agreement partner and will aid its EV production requirements.GM is determined to go the extra mile to master every aspect of electrification to emerge as the undaunted EV leader. In its ambitious strategy, it has laid out a two-year milestone to scale up capacity between 2023 and 2025. It intends to reach a production volume of 1 million EVs in North America and China each by 2025. GM also plans to do away with tailpipe emissions from all its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 and, thereby, is developing a supply chain and recycling strategy.The company has already formed agreements to secure battery raw materials to support its goal. The partnership with Queensland Pacific Metals will further strengthen the procurement of materials as well as ensure waste reduction and a sustainable supply chain.Recently, to transition to a circular battery ecosystem, GM announced that its investment wing, GM Ventures, has invested in Lithion Recycling Inc.'s Series A financing round, facilitating a new GM-Lithion partnership. Lithion's technology will enable it to recover and reuse raw material in its Ultium battery packs, making the EVs more sustainable and economical.The auto magnate looks geared up to make bold headways in its electrification progress.Story continuesShares of GM have lost 44.6% over the past year compared with its industry’s 29.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Cummins Inc.

This is a good sign for the Transportation-Airline Industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Airlines UAL will release its Q3 earnings on October 18th.United Airlines is the second-biggest airline in the U.S. in terms of passengers carried with destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.UAL’s outlook will help investors get a better gauge on the global economic slowdown and how much inflation is impacting travel. More importantly, trading 38% off its 52-week highs investors will want to see how any rising operating costs will affect the company’s earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited returned to profitability in Q2. But CEO Scott Kirby said it was focused on confronting three risks that could grow over the next 6-18 months: industry-wide operational challenges, record fuel prices, and the increasing possibility of a global recession. This will certainly need to be monitored by investors as despite TPI inflation (Travel Price Index) being down 1.8% in August, airline fares were up 33% year over year. While the Transportation sector’s earnings are expected to be up in Q3, inflated prices could start to weigh on consumer demand and is an indicator of rising operating costs for airlines.PerformanceUAL is down -22% year to date, with much of the fall coming during the second quarter as inflation concerns began taking their toll on the stock. The decline is not as steep as the S&amp;P 500’s -25% YTD drop but United has underperformed its peer group’s -13%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the large decline over the last year, UAL is still up +68% over the last decade to outperform its peer group’s +57%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutpacing competitors such as American Airlines AAL and Delta Airlines DAL could also be key for UAL stock. As we can see form the above chart, UAL’s price performance is in the middle of the pack over the last two years, outperforming DAL but underperforming AAL.OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s Q3 earnings is $2.21 per share, expected to climb swing from a loss in Q3 2021 and rise 316%. Sales for Q3 are also expected to be up 64% at $12.70 billion. Estimates for the period have gone up significantly over the last 90 days. Earnings expectations have increased 37% from $1.61 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, UAL’s earnings are expected to be back in the black, swinging from an adjusted loss of -$13.94 per share in FY21 to +$0.45 in 2022. FY23 earnings are set to rebound another 1,189% to hit $5.80 per share. While this is not back to pre-pandemic levels, the large earnings climb is certainly a step in the right direction.Solid top line growth is also expected, with FY22 sales projected to climb 78% and another 15% in FY23 to $50.56 billion. UAL’s fiscal 2022 and FY23 revenue is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels at $40.80 billion in 2019. Valuation Currently trading around $34 a share, UAL has a P/E of 74.8X. This is much higher than the industry average of 12.3X. However, UAL’s high valuation is leveling off quickly with its earnings rebound. UAL is trading much lower than the 747.2X high it saw earlier in the year. And looking at the forward 12 months, UAL’s 7.3X is close to its median over the last decade of 8.8X.Bottom Line  UAL currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Transportation-Airline Industry is in the bottom 32% of over 250 Zacks Industries. However, with earnings on a post-pandemic rebound, a Q3 beat and positive guidance could help UAL stock start to take off.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Longer-term pockets of recovery remain — corporate travel (happening, yet eternally debated) and easing global travel restrictions,"" Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth stated in a new note to clients.""With continued network restoration and lower assumed fuel [costs] next year, the case for traffic growth in ’23 (vs. ’22) is obvious. Over time, capacity normalization should drive unit cost (and unit revenue) normalization,"" he added.The airline industry is already seeing signs of brighter skies after the turbulent COVID-19 period.United Airlines recently lifted its third quarter revenue guidance to 12% growth from 11%. Operating margins are seen at about 10.5%, above a prior estimate for 10%.Rival American Airlines said demand was strong in September — it now sees third quarter sales rising 13% compared to prior guidance for 10% to 12%.Airlines never got an invitation to the lockdown rager, yet they get an equal dose of hangover now that the punch bowl has been taken awayDuane Pfennigwerth, EvercoreThe above-plan guidance comes despite the ongoing overall economic slowdown.Delta reports earnings Thursday morning and may provide more upbeat commentary to fuel a renewed bull case on the airline sector.But, to be sure, there continues to be haters on airline stocks. The NYSE Arca Airline Index has plunged roughly 44% year to date compared to a 20% decline for the S&amp;P 500.The aforementioned Delta's stock is trading on a paltry forward price-to-earnings multiple of 4.8 times compared to the S&amp;P 500's 15.8 times.Story continuesAdded Pfennigwerth, ""As far as we can tell, there is no visible credit or differentiation to the view that pockets of demand remain in recovery. Markets are taking a one-size-fits-all view of cyclical equities into a potential recessionary backdrop, regardless of each sector's experience through the pandemic. The way airline stocks have been acting, you’d think the industry fully participated in the stimulus juiced lockdown party. Instead, travel spent the roaring ’20-’21 in a depression, nearly shut down. Airlines never got an invitation to the lockdown rager, yet they get an equal dose of hangover now that the punch bowl has been taken away.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Shares up just around 1 and 1/2%. The airliner announcing today that it will be adding to its transatlantic travel slate next summer. The news comes as United reports demand up 20% from 2019 during the peak portion of this summer.Joining us now for more on this and the state of the industry, we want to bring in Helane Becker, Cowen senior research analyst. Helane, it's great to see you. So we had the news from United. The news yesterday was American lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right. Demand, especially for international, is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international, and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer.We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season. And we said we thought American, Delta, United had the best opportunity for positive surprise. Because we've gone from the first, say, four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60%, 50% to 60% from 2019 levels. And now we're down closer to 15%.So you've seen that big increase. As markets have opened up, people have shifted and started flying further, especially transatlantic. Not so much trans-pacific, but transatlantic. And business, we've gone from being down about 40% or 50% earlier in the year to being down 25% earlier in the year.So I think those two elements-- and we've still seen strong domestic leisure. But instead of being up 30%, 35%, it's up closer to 10%, 15%. So you've seen that mix shift, which has huge positive implications for revenue. And I think Delta reports tomorrow first. You just mentioned that. And I think you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter or-- the rest of the current quarter, yeah. Fourth quarter.Story continues- And Helane, obviously the industry is still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines?HELANE BECKER: I'm sorry. I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well?- As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages, as we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out, how is this affecting some of the most profitable routes?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. So we're having these issues with, to your point, with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor. It's air traffic control. It's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last, but I was at an airport yesterday, two airports yesterday and the day before. And stores are closed. They haven't reopened. They can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that.And so that's going to inform growth for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that-- you didn't specifically ask about this, but the OEMs are behind on deliveries. So the airlines don't have the-- and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go, and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft.United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot-- they didn't retire any, as a matter of fact, of their wide-body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated an outperform.And the others retired their aircraft. And in part, they were older, so it made sense to retire them. But they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries. They're having issues getting aircraft to be able to grow going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too.- Yeah. Helane, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to rein in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. So the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every-- the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight attendant contract. I would love to hear them talk about-- they probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls.But I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great, both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice if the pilots, the flight attendants, knew what they were going to be earning. And I think that would be good to get that resolved.We also-- as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that.I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has, that Americans mostly have anyway, is a cashback card. And then that's usually followed by a gas card.But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card. And your spend is probably high. And you-- but it takes a while to earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airlines like having that dollar today, because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet. And it definitely helps.But if there's this shift in mix to more leisure-oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that.Demand for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fares are getting a little out of control. And so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving. Or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. And it's just gotten really aggressive.Especially given how far fares have come in the last, say, 18 months. Because obviously, in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting. And in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fares pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs and in part to discourage some demand.But yeah. Flights are full. They're 90%-- well, they're more. They're almost always going out with very few available seats.- Well, certainly airlines, and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helane Becker for joining us this afternoon. Thank you.]"

The uptick followed management’s decision to increase its revenue forecast for third-quarter 2022. AAL will announce third-quarter results on Oct 20.Air-travel demand recovered from the pandemic-induced lows. We expect upbeat air-travel demand, following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, to have aided American Airlines’ top-line performance in the September quarter. Observance of the Labor Day holiday period during the third quarter is likely to have boosted the air traffic further. Evidently, the decision to hike the revenue guidance comes as no surprise.Revised GuidanceAmerican Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenues to rise approximately 13% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation: increase 10-12%). Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) is now anticipated to be 25% higher than the third-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 20-24% rise).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated to be roughly 4.5% compared with the 2-4% band expected earlier. The third-quarter operating margin (excluding net special items) is expected to be roughly 7%. The average fuel cost per gallon forecast is maintained in the $3.73-$3.78 range. However, the guidance for fuel gallons consumed is decreased to 1,031 million from 1,040 million.American Airlines now expects third-quarter 2022 capacity to decline 9.6% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was a decline in the 8-10% range). Due to low capacity, cost per available seat miles or CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is high and expected to increase roughly 14% in third-quarter 2022 from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was a 12-14% increase).Story continuesUpbeat Passenger Revenues Likely to Aid Airlines’ Q3 ResultsDelta Air Lines DAL will kick-start the third-quarter 2022 earnings season for airlines on Oct 13. Like AAL, we expect DAL’s results to reflect upbeat passenger revenues owing to buoyant passenger volumes.DAL expects September-quarter revenues to increase in the 1-5% band from the third-quarter 2019 actuals. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, in third-quarter 2022is expected to increase 22% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals.Like AAL, United Airlines UAL lifted its revenue guidance for third-quarter 2022. UAL is scheduled to announce results on Oct 18. Like AAL and DAL, we also expect UAL’s results to reflect upbeat passenger revenues owing to buoyant passenger volumes.UAL now expects operating revenues to grow 12% from the September-quarter level of 2019 (previous guidance was 11%). United Airlines expects TRASM to increase around 25% in the third quarter of 2022 from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (previous view: up in 24-26% band).

As always, it’s being led off by the big banks.But the banks are still in the doghouse. 14 years after the start of the financial crisis, the banks are still out of favor on Wall Street. This year, most banks stocks are down big, with many at 52-week lows.But are things really that bad? The Federal Reserve is raising rates which should help bank earnings. But the mortgage market has slowed sharply. Some banks will see a big hit to earnings as this part of their business remains slow.And the Street believes that a recession is certainly coming, which will hit bank earnings. Or will it?But the banks are now, as a group, cheap. They have low P/Es and P/B ratios. Some pay dividends over 5%. Others are doing share buybacks.Are the big banks a deal as they hit new lows?5 Big Bank Earnings Charts to Watch This Week1.    JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPMJPMorgan Chase is one of the banks everyone watches each quarter. Led by CEO Jamie Dimon, it’s seen as a bellwether. Dimon has been talking to the financial press this week and he doesn’t sound optimistic about the global economy.JPMorgan Chase had a solid earnings surprise history until the last 2 quarters when it has missed.Shares of JPMorgan are down 35.6% year-to-date and now trade with a forward P/E of just 9.3.It also pays a dividend yielding 3.8%.Should JPMorgan Chase be on your shortlist?2.    Citigroup CCitigroup has the best earnings surprise track record of these 5 banks. It hasn’t missed in 5 years. What an incredible record given the pandemic and its global business.But the Street doesn’t care about Citigroup’s earnings record. Shares are down 33% year-to-date and are down 41% over the last 5-yearsCitigroup is dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 5.8 It also has a low P/B ratio of 0.5. The Street is practically giving it away.Citigroup pays the largest dividend of this group as well, with a yield of 4.8%.Story continuesIs Citigroup a value trap?3.    Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFCWells Fargo had a 7-quarter earnings streak going until last quarter when it missed. It’s a big mortgage bank and has already warned that that business has slowed.Shares of Wells Fargo are down just 16% year-to-date, which is one of the better performances of the big banks. Wells Fargo is cheap at 10.5x forward earnings.It pays a dividend, yielding 2.9%.Analysts have been upgrading Wells Fargo going into this report. Is it time to consider Wells Fargo again?4.    Bank of America Corp. BACBank of America had beat earnings 6 quarters in a row but it, too, missed last quarter.Shares have fallen 31% year-to-date.Like it’s competitors, the sell-off has made Bank of America cheap too. It has a forward P/E of just 9.6.Bank of America also pays a dividend which is yielding 2.9%.Berkshire Hathaway has a big stake in Bank of America. Should investors have it on their short list too?5.    PNC Financial PNCPNC Financial is a big regional bank headquartered in Pittsburgh. It has one of the best earnings surprise track records of these 5 banks, as it has beat 8 quarters in a row.But like the others, PNC Financial shares have sold off in 2022 and are down 26.3%.It’s cheap too, with a forward P/E of just 10.5 and a P/B ratio of 1.3.PNC Financial also pays a juicy dividend now yielding 4%.Should investors be looking at the regional banks for deals?Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BIG.4 Dividend-Paying Retail Stocks to Shield from VolatilityInvestors seem to be nervous and are treading Wall Street with utmost caution as worries about a global slowdown and a possible recession loom large over the stock market. Market pundits fear that the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance to tame inflation might push the economy into a recession.A higher interest rate environment may hit consumer spending activity and this may not be good news for companies in the retail sector. Players in the industry may have to walk a tightrope to woo budget-conscious shoppers. Rising prices of groceries and other essentials are compelling consumers to hold back on discretionary spending and industry participants might turn to promotions and discounts to attract shoppers.Retailers are keeping their fingers crossed and pinning hopes on stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate that should help keep demand alive. Markedly, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% in September from 3.7% a month earlier, while nonfarm payrolls climbed 263,000 for the month. We also note that average hourly wages rose 5% from a year ago and 0.3% on a month-on-month basis.The aforementioned factors do make us optimistic but one should be mindful that the sector is not fully immune to the headwinds that have gripped the stock market lately.

273,83a95522-5c71-3090-b84b-1c8bef448153,RF,2022-10-13,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Regions Financial Corporation's (NYSE:RF) recent 7.1% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-183842799.html,1665599922,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC']","[If you want to know who really controls Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 7.1% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 6.8% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Regions Financial, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Regions Financial, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Regions Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Regions Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Regions Financial. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Regions Financial's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Regions Financial. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. With 10% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Regions FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Regions Financial Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$47m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

(NASDAQ:MAR) Trading At A 36% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-inc-nasdaq-mar-122126594.html,1665663686,STORY,['MAR'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Marriott International The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.29bUS$2.66bUS$3.39bUS$3.66bUS$3.87bUS$4.04bUS$4.19bUS$4.33bUS$4.45bUS$4.57bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.62%Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$92bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$92b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$47bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$72b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$142, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marriott International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.080. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

In its Q3 2022 investor letter, the fund mentioned that investors may have different expectations concerning inflation, interest rates, or economic growth, but, at the end of the day, what we buy will determine the portfolio’s return (and its risk). The fund also said that the need for capital investment over the long term has been, and will likely remain, higher than it anticipated. Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund mentioned Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1995, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based aerospace company with a $108.7 billion market capitalization. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) delivered a 15.36% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 14.82%. The stock closed at $409.99 per share on October 10, 2022.Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.In most NATO countries, which are LMT’s customers, defence outlays are based upon the size of GDP. This is currently growing very fast in nominal terms due to inflation in most countries. A number of countries have also announced significant increases in defence budgets, whether it be Germany, which aims to get to the NATO-agreed 2% of GDP, or Poland, which wants to spend more than twice as much on defence...""

286,8a6d15f4-58c9-3f0a-bc64-979d7ea119bd,MAR,2022-10-13,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-expected-beat-140002087.html,1665496802,STORY,['LMT'],"[The market expects Lockheed Martin (LMT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.5%.Revenues are expected to be $16.79 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.99, delivering a surprise of +14.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

287,546d098e-202f-3a03-b652-04e01e96cfc4,NWSA,2022-10-13,Realtor.com® September Rental Report: National Rent Growth Cools to the Slowest Annual Pace in 16 Months,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-september-rental-report-100000968.html,1665655200,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In September, the U.S. median rental price ($1,759) posted its smallest year-over-year increase (+7.8%) since last summer and further declined from its July 2022 peak (-$22)SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- September data confirms a fall cooldown has come to the rental market, as national rent growth dropped to its lowest annual pace (+7.8%) since June 2021, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Rental Report released today. In another sign of more typical seasonal moderation than last year, the U.S. median rental price posted its second month-over-month decline in eight months in September, further slipping from its July peak.""After more than a year of double-digit yearly rent gains and nearly as many months of record-high rents, it's especially important to see consistency before we confirm a major shift like the recent rental market cooldown. But September data provides that evidence, as national rents continued to pull back from their latest all-time high registered just two months ago,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""This return of more seasonal norms indicates that rental markets are charting a path back toward a more typical balance between supply and demand, compared to the previous year. We expect rent growth to keep slowing in the months ahead, partly driven by the impact of inflation on renters' budgets. However, it's unlikely that rents will return to a more normal pre-COVID pace of growth for at least another year, when available rental inventory starts to reflect the recent uptick in multifamily new construction.""September 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange over Sept. 2021Change over Sept. 2020Overall$1,7597.8 %22.8 %Studio$1,48310.1 %22.8 %1-bed$1,6477.7 %23.0 %2-bed$1,9416.4 %22.4 %National rent cooldown continues, offering renters relief from rising prices September marked the second straight month of consistent moderation in national rents, in terms of both the annual growth rate remaining in single-digit territory and continued month-over-month price declines. These trends are mirroring the earlier shift in for-sale housing, suggesting that the rental market is following similar patterns of more typical seasonal cooling as part of the real estate refresh from the 2021 frenzy. However, like this year's homebuyers, renters are still facing significantly higher housing costs than in prior years, with national rents for all unit sizes at more than 1.2 times their 2020 levels in September. As a result, rental affordability remains a significant challenge, especially as inflation continues to outpace wage growth.Story continuesFor the second month in a row, the U.S. median rental price for 0-2 bedroom units ($1,759) grew at a single-digit year-over-year pace (+7.8%) and dropped on a month-over-month basis, bringing total declines in September over July's peak to $22.Although yearly rent growth moderated to its slowest annual pace since June 2021 (+8.5%), it remained more than two-times faster than the yearly rate in March 2020 (+3.3%) at the onset of COVID. Additionally, national rents were 24.8% higher in September compared to the same month in 2019.Rent growth for larger units also cooled in September, with two-bedroom ($1,941) and one-bedroom ($1,647) median rental prices both rising at a single-digit year-over-year pace for the second month in a row, up 6.4% and 7.7% respectively.Despite outpacing larger unit rents in September, studio rental prices followed a similar pattern of deceleration in September, dropping $15 from the July peak to a median of $1,483. However, studios were the only unit size to maintain a double-digit annual growth pace in rents, up 10.1% (+$136) from September 2021.Sun Belt rental markets moderate; big tech city rents keep climbing Just as September's national rental trends reflected a shift toward relatively normal patterns, local rental markets showed a return to more typical activity. On the one hand, many Sun Belt metros showed substantial signs of yearly rental growth moderation in September, a marked reversal from the area's dramatic rent increases during the pandemic. On the other hand, urban rents are making up for lost time from their COVID slowdown as more Americans once again embrace downtown offices and lifestyles. In fact, big tech cities were among the only large markets to post double-digit annual rent gains in September.In September, rental prices grew at a double-digit annual pace in just eight large metros, including many of the nation's major tech cities. In rank order, the biggest rent gains year-over-year were registered in: Chicago (+23.9%), Boston (+19.9%), New York (18.2%), Providence, R.I. (+16.7%), Oklahoma City (+13.8%), Miami (+13.2%), Kansas City, Mo. (+11.2%) and San Jose, Calif. (+10.7%).Relative to those eight cities, September rent increases were smaller in more than three-quarters of the biggest markets, including many in the Sun Belt area. For example, rents increased by single-digits year-over-year in Dallas (8.8%), San Diego (8.4%), and Orlando, FL (8.3%), each for the first time in at least 15 months.Additionally, four markets posted annual rental price declines in September: Riverside, Calif. (-1.0%), Tampa, Fla. (-0.3%), Las Vegas (-0.2%), and Sacramento, Calif. (-0.1%). In each of these metros, September marked their first yearly drop in rents since the onset of the pandemic.At the same time, compared to three years ago, September rental prices were higher in all 50 of the largest metros, and up by double-digits in 48 markets. Even with their recent rental moderation, Sun Belt metros still top the list of biggest rent gains over September 2019 levels: Miami (+51.8%), Tampa (+40.9%) and Memphis, Tenn. (+37.5%).""Realtor.com®'s September data highlights the true extent of the rental market boom that has taken place over the past three years, and underscores the prevalence of rental affordability challenges faced by many Americans today. Recent surveys we've conducted at Avail also show that higher housing costs are a significant financial strain for many renters and landlords, at a time when inflation is driving up prices across the board,"" said Ryan Coon, VP of Rentals at Realtor.com® and Co-Founder of Avail (part of Realtor.com®). ""In some good news for renters – and further evidence that the rental cooldown will continue – many surveyed landlords indicate that they are adjusting their pricing strategies to account for tenants' tighter budgets.""September 2022 Rental Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetroOverall Median RentOverall Rent YYStudio Median RentStudio Rent YY1-br Median Rent1-br Rent YY2-br Median Rent2-br Rent YYAtlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,7492.4 %$1,7117.5 %$1,6482.2 %$1,9081.9 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,7255.3 %$1,45010.3 %$1,5703.2 %$1,9064.4 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,7794.7 %$1,5775.5 %$1,6954.9 %$1,9075.6 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,1816.6 %$948-10.2 %$1,1144.5 %$1,2548.3 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,99619.9 %$2,78327.3 %$2,78516.4 %$3,34321.4 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,2766.8 %$8482.7 %$1,19912.1 %$1,5008.3 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,6326.3 %$1,57212.2 %$1,5126.7 %$1,7745.5 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$2,04523.9 %$1,74651.8 %$2,01726.1 %$2,24218.0 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind.$1,3039.3 %$1,1849.6 %$1,2308.2 %$1,3516.5 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,2439.8 %$89511.9 %$1,1809.8 %$1,34910.1 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2939.5 %$1,0919.2 %$1,2209.5 %$1,3556.1 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,5968.8 %$1,40911.0 %$1,4799.4 %$1,8907.9 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,9664.1 %$1,6574.2 %$1,8343.6 %$2,2623.8 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3088.4 %$1,14114.7 %$1,16611.3 %$1,4466.3 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,6899.6 %$1,2765.7 %$1,5236.8 %$1,8214.7 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,3765.7 %$1,3375.0 %$1,2705.8 %$1,5324.7 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,2638.5 %$1,12612.3 %$1,19310.7 %$1,3382.9 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,4904.0 %$1,42431.1 %$1,4093.9 %$1,5931.3 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,30811.2 %$9957.9 %$1,21410.8 %$1,50110.8 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,531-0.2 %$99210.2 %$1,408-0.6 %$1,631-3.0 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,9398.0 %$2,34611.8 %$2,7116.8 %$3,4186.4 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,1319.6 %$97910.3 %$1,0567.6 %$1,2467.9 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,3016.4 %$1,1999.0 %$1,2927.6 %$1,2881.0 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,59013.2 %$2,29219.1 %$2,31413.3 %$2,88810.8 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5257.6 %$1,2079.8 %$1,4238.5 %$1,7113.2 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5593.6 %$1,2181.5 %$1,4662.5 %$1,8732.3 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,7108.8 %$1,6254.3 %$1,6368.1 %$1,7549.1 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,3191.5 %NA*New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,83818.2 %$2,61221.5 %$2,52313.0 %$3,12414.2 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$96113.8 %$81917.0 %$89318.3 %$1,00912.7 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,7908.3 %$1,5838.9 %$1,6929.2 %$2,0018.0 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-M.D.$1,7416.1 %$1,44214.0 %$1,6745.4 %$1,8852.6 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,6380.2 %$1,2921.4 %$1,5371.1 %$1,776-1.9 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,5137.7 %$1,35910.9 %$1,4777.4 %$1,5983.6 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,8337.2 %$1,4705.0 %$1,7646.4 %$2,0435.9 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.$2,04316.7 %NA*Raleigh, N.C.$1,6117.4 %$1,51510.1 %$1,5078.3 %$1,7918.0 %Richmond, Va.$1,4068.3 %$1,26516.3 %$1,32612.9 %$1,5547.1 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,112-1.0 %$1,179-19.9 %$1,884-0.6 %$2,4210.0 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,3018.7 %$1,04118.9 %$1,21110.4 %$1,48712.2 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,921-0.1 %$1,683-2.5 %$1,791-0.5 %$2,0480.6 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2937.5 %$1,0642.7 %$1,2197.7 %$1,4716.3 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,8688.4 %$2,2937.8 %$2,6686.9 %$3,1346.7 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$3,1268.1 %$2,65110.9 %$2,8405.0 %$3,5666.1 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,33310.7 %$2,69510.2 %$3,10611.6 %$3,7239.7 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,1874.7 %$1,8178.5 %$2,1583.2 %$2,5125.7 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,2155.9 %$9733.3 %$1,1695.3 %$1,2855.3 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,755-0.3 %$1,6071.3 %$1,6691.1 %$1,888-3.1 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4154.3 %$1,36419.1 %$1,3834.8 %$1,421-2.0 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-Va.-Md.-W.

288,87e5046c-8ea5-33f0-be50-9ea27bd4faf5,KLAC,2022-10-13,Chip Industry Braces for ‘Heavy Blow’ From China Export Curbs,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-cuts-forecast-blaming-202509425.html,1665624791,STORY,['AMAT'],"[(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration’s new restrictions on doing business with China are sending shock waves through the global semiconductor industry, with chip-equipment makers girding for perhaps the most painful fallout.Most Read from BloombergA Tense Pay Dispute Overshadows Nintendo’s Upcoming Bayonetta 3$200 Diesel Puts Biden in an Ugly CornerTrump Special Master Has ‘No Patience’ for Records SpatsBlinken Says China Wants to Seize Taiwan on ‘Much Faster Timeline’Putin’s War Escalation Is Hastening Demographic Crash for RussiaApplied Materials Inc., a leading maker of chipmaking equipment, on Wednesday slashed its forecast for the fourth quarter, warning that the new export regulations will reduce sales by about $400 million in the period. It now expects revenue of about $6.4 billion, plus or minus $250 million, compared with a previous forecast of roughly $6.65 billion.In another sign of retreat, Applied Materials, along with KLA Corp. and Lam Research Corp., have started or are preparing to pull employees from Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., China’s most advanced maker of memory chips, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg. ASML Holding NV, another top producer of manufacturing gear, told its US employees in the US to refrain from servicing customers in China.“The US government’s recent restrictions are serious and escalate the economic (and potentially geopolitical) conflict with China - the largest customer of semis,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote, estimating the restrictions could shave off as much as $7 billion in 2023 sales for vendors like Applied Materials.The Biden White House outlined the export curbs Friday, part of a years-long campaign to hamper China’s ability to develop the most advanced chips and equip its military. China is pouring billions of dollars into developing a domestic semiconductor industry that’s less dependent on the rest of the world, but those chipmakers still need to purchase highly specialized equipment from suppliers in the US, Europe and other parts of Asia.Story continues“The new regulations could deliver a heavy blow to Applied Materials and Lam Research, which have a high sales exposure to China,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Masahiro Wakasugi and Brian Moran wrote in a research note Thursday.The restrictions hit when the industry was already suffering a downturn, shifting from a worldwide shortage of chips during the pandemic -- when demand for electronics skyrocketed -- to a glut in a matter of months as demand cooled, reflecting the boom-and-bust nature of the sector. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has dropped 12% since the restrictions were announced. The index is now down more than 44% this year.Netherlands-based ASML has been selling its deep ultraviolet, or DUV, machines to Chinese customers but has held back its more advanced extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, technology. It’s not clear whether those existing sales will be affected by the new Biden administration regulations.The semiconductor industry has had an inkling for weeks that tighter rules were coming, with Nvidia Corp. warning in September that US government restrictions on exporting AI chips to China could affect hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.Companies such as Applied Materials and Intel Corp. can’t easily walk away from China, which is the biggest single market for their products and part of a global supply chain for electronics.Fallout has been swift and far-reaching, and Asia’s biggest chip stocks are also reeling. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plunged a record 8.3% Tuesday, while Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. also retreated.Applied Materials shares are down about 14% since last Thursday, the day before the new restrictions were announced. After that steep decline, its latest warning didn’t do much to jar investors. The stock was little changed in late trading Wednesday.The Santa Clara, California-based company also trimmed its profit forecast. Excluding some items, earnings will be $1.54 to $1.78 a share in the fourth quarter, which ends Oct. 30. That’s down from as much as $2.18 previously.The lower earnings outlook is a result of reduced sales and a writedown of 23 cents a share for inventory and manufacturing tied to the new export regulations, the company said. Applied Materials also expects the rules to hurt sales in its fiscal first quarter by roughly the same amount.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages OnHow Gamers Beat NFTsA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketJohn Mack, Who Led Morgan Stanley Into a Crisis, Regrets Little©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The withdrawals are coming this week, the people said, following new regulations from the Biden administration last week that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chip-making equipment or employing American citizens without a license.Yangtze Memory was also among more than 30 organizations that the US Commerce Department put on its so-called unverified list, which restricts their ability to buy American technology.Companies like Applied Materials that produce chip-making machines often send employees to customer facilities to help them fine-tune the manufacturing processes. It’s not clear whether the companies are pulling staff because of Yangtze Memory’s placement on the unverified list or because of other restrictions. The US companies need to assess their constraints under the Biden administration’s rules.Yangtze Memory will likely be able keep operating some production lines on stockpiled components, one of the people said.The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported some details of the Yangtze supplier moves earlier.The severity of the US regulations stunned many in the chip industry, potentially jeopardizing the operations for hundreds of Chinese semiconductor companies. The Biden administration argued the regulations are necessary to prevent the Communist Party from becoming more of an economic and military threat.Story continuesChina has ambitious goals to develop its supercomputers and become a leader in artificial intelligence, said Thea D. Rozman Kendler, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. “It is using these capabilities to monitor, track and surveil their own citizens, and fuel its military modernization.”The Chinese government has made it a national priority to build a domestic semiconductor industry, pouring tens of billions of dollars into the effort. This year, President Xi Jinping renewed calls for the country to develop the technologies critical for national security, invoking the so-called “whole nation system” that propelled China’s space and nuclear weapons programsThe Biden rules dealt a serious setback to that effort. Chip stocks and related companies tumbled across the country.

Highlights from the letter include:Aimco has implemented a clearly defined value creation strategy and a comprehensive transformation of the Company’s legacy business under the leadership of a reconstituted Board and new executive management team.Since the December 2020 spin-off of Apartment Income REIT Corp., Aimco has delivered total stockholder returns of 45%1, significantly outperforming its identified developer peer group2, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index, the MSCI US REIT Index, the S&amp;P 500, and the Russell 2000.The Company’s new, majority-independent and reconstituted Board possesses highly relevant experience and complementary skillsets to oversee its growth strategy.Aimco’s Board and management team are focused on the future and have a clear plan to build on the Company’s progress and continue to drive growth and outsized returns.The Aimco Board believes that the election of Land &amp; Buildings’ candidates would remove expertise from the Aimco Board that is critical to the Company’s success.Story continuesAimco’s definitive proxy materials and other materials regarding the Board’s recommendation for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders can be found at https://investors.aimco.com.1 TSR calculation as of September 30, 20222 Includes AHH, CLPR, CSR, FOR, FPH, HHC, IRT, JBGS, JOE, STRS, TRC, VRE, and WRE (per AIV 2021 10-K) represents simple averageThe full text of the letter being mailed to stockholders follows:October 12, 2022Dear Fellow Stockholders:Your Board of Directors and management team are committed to enhancing the value of your investment in Aimco and have been unwavering in our commitment to acting in the best interests of our stockholders. We have implemented a clearly defined value creation strategy and a comprehensive transformation of Aimco’s legacy business under a recently reconstituted, majority-independent Board (the ""New Aimco Board"" or the ""Board"") and all-new executive management team.Since the New Aimco Board and management team assumed their current roles following the Apartment Income REIT Corp. (""AIR"") spin-off in December 2020, Aimco has delivered total stockholder returns of 45%3, significantly outperforming its identified developer peer group4, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index, the MSCI US REIT Index, the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2000.Aimco expects to continue to drive growth and outsized returns by:Executing on its deep pipeline of real estate development opportunities in targeted high growth markets, investing when conditions are right and monetizing when advantageous.Practicing disciplined capital allocation, directing capital to additional, multifamily-focused, real estate investments and acquiring Aimco shares opportunistically.Funding investments through the recycling of Aimco equity and through joint venture partnerships.Continuing to simplify the Aimco business through increasingly focused capital and geographic allocation.The New Aimco Board and new management team executing this plan were put in place in connection with the 2020 spin-off of AIR, with the Company:Appointing six new Aimco directors to replace resigning members of the prior Board, after a thorough search process assisted by a leading executive and board search firm with deep expertise in the real estate industry. As a result, six of Aimco’s eight independent directors have been added within the past two years. Aimco also retained three directors with complementary skillsets and important historical knowledge of Aimco’s business operations;Appointing a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer and general counsel to replace the prior pre-spin management team; andSeparating Aimco’s Board chair and CEO positions and appointing a new chairman of the Board.Despite Aimco’s clear momentum and the recent reconstitution of the Aimco Board, Land &amp; Buildings Investment Management LLC (""Land &amp; Buildings"") has initiated a proxy contest and is seeking to remove and replace two of your highly qualified directors. We have engaged with Land &amp; Buildings to better understand its perspectives and have reviewed the qualifications of the candidates it has put forth. It is clear from our interactions to date, however, that Land &amp; Buildings is primarily focused on historical issues and decisions made prior to the reconstitution of the Aimco Board and the replacement of the Aimco management team. While the New Aimco Board and management are open to continued dialogue with Land &amp; Buildings, we believe that additional director turnover at this time is unwarranted. We also believe that the candidates proposed by Land &amp; Buildings would not bring any relevant expertise that is not already well represented on the Aimco Board, and that election of Land &amp; Buildings’ candidates would remove expertise from the New Aimco Board that is critical to our success.Against this backdrop, you now face an important decision regarding the future of your investment and go-forward Board of Directors. Your Board has three directors up for re-election who have highly relevant skills and expertise and are important contributors to Aimco’s ongoing success. To protect your investment, we strongly recommend that you vote the enclosed universal WHITE proxy card today ""FOR"" all three of Aimco’s qualified and experienced director nominees: Jay Paul Leupp, Michael A. Stein and R. Dary Stone. Please vote today to ensure your voice is heard at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders (""Annual Meeting"") on December 16, 2022.PROTECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.USE THE UNIVERSAL WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY TO VOTE FOR ALL THREEOF AIMCO’S QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED DIRECTORSAIMCO IS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING ITS VALUE ADD STRATEGYFor the past 21 months, Aimco has been successfully executing a growth strategy focused on value add, opportunistic, and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.As part of this strategy, we’ve taken decisive actions to drive stockholder value, by:Creating $100 million of value from the monetization of successfully executed development and redevelopment projects;Securing significant, high-quality, future development opportunities, more than tripling Aimco's controlled pipeline to a total potential of more than 15 million square feet, located in high-growth markets;Retiring or refinancing more than $1 billion of near-term liabilities, eliminating substantially all of our floating rate exposure;Entering into a strategic capital partnership with Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation providing core equity capital for up to $1 billion of Aimco-led multifamily development projects and creating the opportunity to earn third-party management fees and incentive income;Unlocking $265 million of asset value by selling three stabilized multifamily assets at prices above the values in Aimco’s internal Net Asset Value (""NAV"") estimate and by selling a partial interest in our passive minority investment in the life science developer, IQHQ, generating a greater than 50% internal rate of return;Eliminating various legacy entanglements with AIR through the early repayment of the $534 million purchase money note, the reduction of leasehold liabilities from $475.1 million down to $6.1 million, and the amendment of key provisions of the master leasing agreement with AIR;Acquiring approximately 742,164 Aimco shares at a weighted average price of $5.93 per share in the first half of 2022 and increasing the Company’s share repurchase authorization from 10 million to 15 million shares; andBuilding and maintaining a highly qualified and dedicated team of real estate investment professionals, achieving an all-time Company record employee engagement score of 4.52 out of 5, based on independent third-party surveys.AIMCO HAS DELIVERED SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR STOCKHOLDERSSince the December 2020 spin-off, Aimco has significantly outperformed its identified developer peer group, real estate market indices, and broader market indices, as evidenced in the following chart.From an operating perspective, we have generated significant value across our stabilized portfolio and our development pipeline. For example, during the first half of 2022, we increased net operating income by 14.9%, and since the start of 2021, we have nearly tripled the Company’s future development pipeline.Importantly, we have a clear plan to build on this progress and drive continued growth. We will remain primarily focused on multifamily housing with an increased allocation to value add and opportunistic investments. We will also continue to leverage the Company’s best-in-class platform, existing portfolio of value add and stable core properties, and an investment pipeline that leads to superior risk-adjusted returns.Despite these strong results and clear and actionable strategy, the New Aimco Board is not standing still. We routinely consider all viable options to enhance and unlock stockholder value and remain committed to doing so going forward.NEW AIMCO BOARD AND MANAGEMENT TEAM HAVE ENGAGED CONSTRUCTIVELYWITH STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING LAND &amp; BUILDINGSAimco is committed to open and constructive engagement with all stockholders, including Land &amp; Buildings. Aimco has held more than 80 individual meetings with more than 35 current and prospective stockholders in the past 13 months, including stockholders that own in the aggregate more than 80% of Aimco’s outstanding shares of common stock, as well as multiple meetings with Land &amp; Buildings, as described in the Company’s proxy statement. The New Aimco Board has demonstrated that we value and act on the feedback we receive.The New Aimco Board and management team are focused on the future, executing a clear and effective strategy to enhance the value of your investment, while Land &amp; Buildings’ complaints primarily relate to decisions made almost two years ago by the pre-spin Board of Directors and management team.THE DIRECTORS ON AIMCO’S MAJORITY-INDEPENDENT, RECONSTITUTED BOARDBRING HIGHLY RELEVANT SKILLS AND FRESH PERSPECTIVESAimco is seeking your support to vote FOR ALL of its three highly qualified, experienced directors at this year’s Annual Meeting: Jay Paul Leupp, Michael A.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance, condition or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, among others, that may affect actual results or outcomes include, but are not limited to: (i) the risk that the 2022 preliminary plans and goals may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, (ii) the inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the pipeline investments and projects, and (iii) changes in general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements, which are based on management’s expectations and estimates, are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained.Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to: the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Company’s business and on the global and U.S. economies generally; real estate and operating risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the amount, location and quality of competitive new housing supply; the timing and effects of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and developments; changes in operating costs, including energy costs; negative economic conditions in our geographies of operation; loss of key personnel; the Company’s ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rate and property operating results; the Company’s ability to meet budgeted costs and timelines, and, if applicable, achieve budgeted rental rates related to redevelopment and development investments; expectations regarding sales of apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; the ability to successfully operate as two separate companies each with more narrowed focus; insurance risks, including the cost of insurance, and natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; financing risks, including the availability and cost of financing; the risk that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios; legal and regulatory risks, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; the terms of laws and governmental regulations that affect us and interpretations of those laws and regulations; possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of apartment communities presently or previously owned by the Company; activities by stockholder activists, including a proxy contest; the Company’s relationship with each other after the consummation of the business separation; the ability and willingness of the Company and their subsidiaries to meet and/or perform their obligations under any contractual arrangements that are entered into among the parties in connection with the business separation and any of their obligations to indemnify, defend and hold the other party harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities; and the ability to achieve some or all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the business separation.In addition, the Company’s current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on the Company’s ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.Readers should carefully review the Company’s financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and in Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and the other documents the Company files from time to time with the SEC.

It is understood and agreed that any such projections, estimates, targets, statements and information are not to be viewed as facts and are subject to significant business, financial, economic, operating, competitive and other risks, uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control, that no assurance can be given that any particular financial projections or targets will be realized, that actual results may differ from projected results and that such differences may be material. While all financial projections, estimates and targets are necessarily speculative, we believe that the preparation of prospective financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection, estimate or target extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial projections, estimates and targets. The inclusion of financial projections, estimates and targets in this presentation should not be regarded as an indication that we or our representatives, considered or consider the financial projections, estimates and targets to be a reliable prediction of future events.Glossary and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresThis document includes certain financial and operating measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco’s definitions and calculations of these Non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These Non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) MARGIN: Represents an apartment community’s net operating income as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues.PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI): NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations, and financing arrangements. NOI is also considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. Reconciliations of NOI as presented in this document to Aimco’s consolidated GAAP amounts are provided below. Due to the diversity of its economic ownership interests in its apartment communities in the periods presented, Aimco evaluates the performance of the apartment communities in its segments using Property NOI, which represents the NOI for the apartment communities that Aimco consolidates and excludes apartment communities that it does not consolidate. Property NOI is defined as rental and other property revenue less property operating expenses. In its evaluation of community results, Aimco excludes utility cost reimbursement from rental and other property revenues and reflects such amount as a reduction of the related utility expense within property operating expenses. The following table presents the reconciliation of GAAP rental and other property revenue to the revenues before utility reimbursements and GAAP property operating expenses to expenses, net of utility reimbursements.Segment NOI ReconciliationTwelve Months Ended (in thousands)December 31, 2021December 31, 2020Total Real Estate OperationsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursementsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursements  Total (per consolidated statements of operations)$169,836 $67,613 $151,451 $61,514  Adjustment: Utilities reimbursement (3,022)$(3,022) (2,163) (2,163) Adjustment: Non-stabilized and other amounts not allocated [2] (30,629) (21,158) (18,528) (17,676) Total Stabilized Operating (per Schedule 6)$136,185 $43,433 $130,760 $41,675    Segment NOI ReconciliationThree Months Ended (in thousands)June 30, 2022June 30, 2021Total Real Estate OperationsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursementsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursements  Total (per consolidated statements of operations)$50,697 $19,708 $40,418 $16,403  Adjustment: Utilities reimbursement (1,347) (1,347) (1,128) (1,128) Adjustment: Assets Held for Sale (1,823)$568  (1,798) 634  Adjustment: Other Real Estate (4,383)$1,317  (3,138) 1,090  Adjustment: Non-stabilized and other amounts not allocated [2] (10,040) (9,825) (4,589) (7,056) Total Stabilized Operating (per Schedule 6)$33,104 $10,420 $29,765 $9,943       Segment NOI ReconciliationSix Months Ended (in thousands)June 30, 2022June 30, 2021Total Real Estate OperationsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursementsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursements  Total (per consolidated statements of operations)$100,691 $38,929 $80,222 $33,345  Adjustment: Utilities reimbursement (2,903) (2,903) (2,473) (2,473) Adjustment: Assets Held for Sale (3,628) 1,159  (3,503) 1,265  Adjustment: Other Real Estate (9,378) (2,822) (6,324) (2,127) Adjustment: Non-stabilized and other amounts not allocated [2] (19,455) (13,696) (8,903) (9,871) Total Stabilized Operating (per Schedule 6)$65,327 $20,667 $59,018 $20,139 [1] Approximately two-thirds of Aimco’s utility costs are reimbursed by residents. These reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues on Aimco’s consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. This adjustment represents the reclassification of utility reimbursements from revenues to property operating expenses for the purpose of evaluating segment results and as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6. Aimco also excludes the reimbursement amounts from the calculation of Average Revenue per Apartment Home throughout this Earnings Release and Supplemental Schedules.[2] Properties not included in the Stabilized Operating Portfolio and other amounts not allocated includes operating results of properties not presented in the Stabilized Operation Portfolio as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6 during the periods shown, as well as property management and casualty expense, which are not included in property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements in the Supplemental Schedule 6 presentation.About AimcoAimco is a diversified real estate company primarily focused on value add, opportunistic, and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.

Clean energy technologies focused on the whole energy value chain, from power generation to storage and distribution, were at the forefront with $257 billion investment last year. Other major trends include applied AI, Cloud, and edge computing, Web3, and immersive reality technologies, among others.The companies picked in this list are at the forefront of their market segments and industries and hold significant competitive advantage over their peers based on strong technological capabilities.

As of October 10, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 24.5% since the beginning of 2022, the Nasdaq composite is down 33.3% for the year, and the Dow has tanked by over 19% year to date. The Fed has signaled that it will remain hawkish until inflation is tamed, even if it throws the economy in a recession. Analysts at major banks are slashing their market forecasts in anticipation of a recession. On October 3, Reuters reported that both Credit Suisse and Citigroup slashed their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500. Credit Suisse analysts see the S&amp;P 500 falling to 3,850 points by the end of 2022, down 10% from its prior target. Citigroup cut its target for the S&amp;P 500 by 4% and said that it sees the S&amp;P 500 reaching 4,000 points by year-end. On October 10, billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, James Dimon, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he revealed that he sees the S&amp;P 500 losing an additional 20% from current levels by year-end, which implies the S&amp;P 500 falling to below 3000 points. Jamie Dimon said that unexpectedly high interest rates, quantitative tightening, and the Ukraine war can push the U.S. economy into a recession in 2023. Here are some comments from Jamie Dimon about where he sees the S&amp;P 500 hitting a trough:""It really depends on that 'soft landing' (mild recession) or 'hard landing' (severe recession) thing. Since I don't know the answer to that, it's hard for me to answer that. But it could be another easy 20%. And I think the next 20% will be much more painful than the first, rates going up another 100 basis points will be a lot more painful than the first 100, because people aren't used to it...""The stock market is in turmoil and is highly volatile.

A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”12. Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) proved resilient in the face of ongoing macro pressures and delivered a strong quarterly result along with “better-than-feared” guidance for the third quarter. Net sales increased 7% year-on-year (10% constant currency) to $121.2 billion, while operating profit declined 57% to $3.3 billion. The drop in operating profit was attributable not only to external macro factors, such as elevated shipping and fuel costs, but also lower productivity and efficiency costs as a result of some overcapacity on the back of its recent investment cycle. It was pleasing to see that the company has begun to make progress on the more controllable costs, particularly productivity and staffing, with headcount, for example, down almost 100,000 over the quarter. We continue to believe Amazon is well positioned to manage these short-term issues and remains on track to deliver significant profit improvements over the next twelve months.Management also confirmed that they have not seen any deterioration in Prime membership growth or retention following the 17% increase in Prime fees put through earlier in the year. This is not surprising to us, as in our view, the price increase was more than justified given the tremendous amount of customer value that has been added since the last price increase was implemented back in 2018, which includes the doubling of its fulfilment network and workforce, significant expansion of free same-day delivery and considerable investments in video and music content. Ultimately, we remain positive about Amazon’s future and believe that the company’s scale and market leadership will continue to drive growth for many years to come.”11. AT&amp;T Inc.

In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”7. Vale S.A.

Vale’s stock price is about where it was at the beginning of last year. Despite the market’s lack of enthusiasm, the company generated about $20 billion of free cash flow last year. Not bad for a company with a market cap of a little over $100 billion and no substantive debt as of the end of March. 4 What did the company do with all that cash? Last year, Vale paid out about $9 billion in regularly scheduled dividends and distributed another $10 billion between extra dividends and share repurchases. Combined with dividends distributed in the first quarter of this year and a recently announced share repurchase, Vale has returned or announced the return of over $33 billion since the beginning of last year, almost a 32% yield relative to the market cap of the company.

BAX is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by a strong product portfolio. The robust revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022 on the back of a strong acute therapies profile is expected to contribute further. However, generic competition for cyclophosphamide and a sluggish macroeconomic environment is worrying.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 35% compared with a 47.7% decline of the industry and a 24.8% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical technology company has a market capitalization of $27.69 billion. The company projects 7.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Acute Therapies Profile: We are upbeat about Baxter’s performance in acute therapies, which has been continuously driven by improving utilization for continuous renal replacement (“CRRT”) globally and increased demand for multi-organ support products. In acute therapies, Baxter offers the first three-in-one oXIRIS set for CRRT therapy and sepsis management protocols.The company has been witnessing tremendous demand for many products, which include its PrisMax and Prismaflex control units (monitors).Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Baxter’s impressive product portfolio that boasts improved existing products and new product development. Management announced plans to introduce therapies and products that can be expected to further contribute to sales by 2023. Baxter’s product pipeline is witnessing the addition of generic injectables and the next generation of its premix technology, among other notable mentions.During the first quarter of 2022, Baxter announced its initial investments in nine start-ups participating in the mHUB Accelerator — the largest and fastest-growing physical product innovation center in the United States. Last month, Baxter announced the receipt of the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its new Novum IQ syringe infusion pump (SYR) with Dose IQ Safety Software. The company expects to introduce the Novum IQ platform in the global markets to continue delivering a strong and streamlined experience for customers, subject to the receipt of necessary approvals.Story continuesStrong Topline Growth in Q2: Baxter’s solid second-quarter 2022 results at constant currency buoy optimism. The company witnessed strong performance across four of its business units. Growth in the Americas is encouraging. However, contraction in both gross and operating margins is a concern.DownsidesSluggish Macroeconomic Environment: Baxter depends on the European Union for about a third of its sales. This is a cause of concern, given the sluggish macroeconomic environment, a glum outlook for hospital spending and the tightening of reimbursements. The outlook also remains slightly uneasy in the United States, where demand for many healthcare products is soft, with an expectation of further price cuts on account of healthcare reforms.Generic Competition for Cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment. Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance has lacked luster for the better part of the last five years. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. Despite a promising portfolio, the company has failed to grab significant market share and substantially grow its top line, thanks to generic competition.Estimate TrendBaxter is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 12.1% south to $3.63.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.78 billion, suggesting a 17.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Baxter International Inc.

303,c91f314f-bbd4-3875-baa0-07c8f25321d4,TRV,2022-10-13,Analysts Estimate Travelers (TRV) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-travelers-trv-report-140002583.html,1665583202,STORY,['TRV'],"[Travelers (TRV) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.6%.Revenues are expected to be $9.17 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Travelers?For Travelers, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -24.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Travelers will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Travelers would post earnings of $2 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.57, delivering a surprise of +28.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Travelers doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: CMI) will soon begin building its new gigawatt electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, reaffirming the company’s commitment to expanding the green hydrogen economy in Europe and globally.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221013005344/en/Cummins Spain electrolyzer manufacturing facility (Photo: Business Wire)Last year, Cummins announced it had selected Spain as the site of a new proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer plant. Earlier this year, the company purchased more than 530,000 sq. ft. (50,000 sq. m.) of land in the industrial area of Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha, where it is now preparing to begin construction.""We’re excited to be a part of Guadalajara and put down our roots in Spain. The growing hydrogen economy here continues to be an attractive environment for Cummins to increase its global electrolyzer manufacturing footprint,"" said Amy Davis, Vice President and President of New Power at Cummins. ""With the support of the Spanish government and European Union, Spain’s hydrogen market has great potential. This facility will poise Cummins to help European customers transition their energy supply and meet ambitious sustainability goals. This plant is also another step toward achieving Cummins’ own carbon neutrality targets.""Construction of the new PEM electrolyzer plant is anticipated to be complete at the end of 2023. It will initially create approximately 150 high-skill jobs, with the potential to add another 200 jobs as production grows. The more than 200,000 sq. ft. (20,000 sq. m.) facility will house system assembly and testing and have the capacity to produce 500MW of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1GW per year.Cummins’ investment in Spain adds to the company’s global efforts to scale development and manufacturing of zero-emissions technologies and ultimately reduce carbon emissions. The company also recently announced the expansion of PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1GW.Story continues""Green"" hydrogen – produced through water electrolysis using renewable electricity – is a key enabler to economy-wide decarbonization. Once produced, hydrogen can be stored as a liquid or a gas and transported. As an alternative to fossil fuels, hydrogen is a viable zero-emissions solution for some of the world’s most energy intensive and hardest-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty commercial transportation, manufacturing, industrial processes and chemical production.""By increasing our ability to meet demand for hydrogen generation technology, this facility will help accelerate the global clean energy transition and the role of hydrogen as a viable alternative energy source in Europe,"" said Alexey Ustinov, Vice President of Electrolyzers at Cummins. ""Cummins is committed to helping the European Union produce more hydrogen domestically, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and securing a sustainable future.""Cummins has a long history of advanced technology and engineering capabilities and innovates across a broad portfolio of market-leading renewable hydrogen technologies. It has been part of many of the world’s hydrogen ""firsts,"" including powering the world’s largest PEM electrolyzer in operation at 20MW in Bécancour, Canada; the world’s first megawatt-scale demonstration plant for storing wind energy in the natural gas grid in Windgas Falkenhagen, Germany; the world’s first 100% hydrogen-powered passenger train fleet in Lower Saxony, Germany; and the world’s first hydrogen refueling station for ships, cars, trucks and industrial customers in Antwerp, Belgium.About CumminsCummins Inc., a global power technology leader, is a corporation of complementary business segments that design, manufacture, distribute and service a broad portfolio of power solutions.

It is worth considering Cummins (CMI), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry.This engine maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11.48%.For the last reported quarter, Cummins came out with earnings of $4.77 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.37 per share, representing a surprise of 9.15%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.55 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.04 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.80%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Cummins lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cummins currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.41%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 3, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The eGen Force caters to the needs of the U.S. Army’s Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, as the system is designed for 50-ton tracked vehicles. It can also be extended to 70-ton tracked vehicles, thereby enabling it to meet requirements for future Main Battle Tank models.The product acts like a power distribution system equipped with an electric motor and inverter for onboard vehicle power and parallel hybrid operation. This will reduce enemy detection, both auditory and thermal, by engine-off mobility, increasing the survival rate of soldiers.While manufacturing the eGen Force System, Allison has blended its technical expertise in combat vehicles and electric hybrid propulsion solutions. Before designing the framework of the eGen Force, ALSN conducted a comprehensive trade study based on more than 70 years of cross-drive development to choose the optimal architecture for an electric hybrid combat vehicle that can optimize efficiency, performance, reliability and manufacturability. To reduce developmental risk, the renowned OEM combined established parts from its X1100-3B1 transmission, used in the Abrams Main Battle Tank, with new components built on tested design strategies.Allison said that the eGen Force has begun dyno and engine stand testing that will be followed by vehicle testing in early 2023.The company is partnering with American Rheinmetall Vehicles, LLC, (“ARV”) to integrate the eGen Force into the latter’s OMFV offering. The ARV vehicle delivers premium mobility and power solutions in a modern chassis that greatly benefits soldiers and squads in their mission.ARV provides tracked and wheeled combat vehicle platforms and sub-systems to the U.S. Forces.Allison is a proven player in the propulsion system domain. It is driven to expand its eGen Power portfolio. Recently, it formed a strategic cooperation agreement with Anadolu Isuzu, Turkey’s top manufacturer of buses and trucks, to expand propulsion solutions. Per the agreement, Allison will supply its eGen Power 100S electric axles to Anadolu Isuzu. These will be integrated with Anadolu Isuzu’s light-duty truck and midibus platforms for application in refuse, distribution and public transportation.In another stride in its eGen Power products portfolio, the Germany-based vehicle manufacturer, Quantron, recently integrated Allison’s 130D e-Axle into its new fuel-cell electric vehicle. It is a heavy-duty truck capable of tractor and chassis derivatives and made its debut at the IAA Transportation 2022, which was held in Hanover, Germany, a while ago.After a steady success in the eGen Power portfolio, the latest launch of its first electric hybrid propulsion system further contributes to its innovative product launches.Shares of Allison have inched up 3.8% over the past year against its industry’s decline of 43.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksALSN currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Cummins Inc.

Applications will range from bi-directional charging, vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, stationary storage, solar products, software applications, cloud management tools, microgrid solutions, hydrogen fuel cells and more. The services will also allow the sale of energy from EV and stationary storage batteries back to utilities during peak consumption periods.Much of the above-mentioned technology will become available to consumers through Ultium Home, which is the residential-focused section of GM Energy.The interface for GM Energy's solutions will be GM's Energy Services Cloud, equipped with data and energy management tools, building a holistic connection between residential, fleet and commercial energy assets for customers.Many large-scale companies across the United States are working with GM Energy to provide energy services. Some of them are Con Edison, Graniterock and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative. Among them is a partnership with SunPower, one of the leading solar technology providers in the country. The two companies will co-develop and offer customers integrated solar energy-powered systems in homes with EV and battery solutions, solar panels and home energy storage. The home energy framework seeks to enable drivers to power their homes with the battery in their EVs. This unlocks the scope of powering homes during times of necessity.  Moreover, SunPower will become a preferred installer for the home energy system and offer the scope to add solar power to their homes. The home energy system will be available alongside the retail launch of the upcoming 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, which is slated to begin production in fall 2023. GM expects all of the new Ultium Home and Commercial products to go into production in fourth-quarter 2023.To put to use the feature of powering homes through EVs, GM has initiated a V2H pilot project between GM Energy and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&amp;E”). After initial trial runs, the two companies expect to expand the V2H offer to a subset of residential customers within PG&amp;E's service area, expected to begin in 2023.Also, as part of GM Energy, Ultium Charge 360 will continue to expand its existing public charging networks, integrated mobile apps, and additional product and service offerings over time.In another development to its charging capabilities, General Motors recently secured a new source of cost-competitive nickel and cobalt for Ultium battery cells with a strategic investment in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia. The nickel processing will be carried out in a manner that will reduce waste with no requirement for a tailings dam. Per the agreement, GM is expected to invest up to $69 million in Queensland Pacific Metals to develop its proposed Townsville Energy Chemicals Hub Project in Northern Australia.The nickel and cobalt extracted will power a broad portfolio of trucks, SUVs, vans and luxury vehicles of GM, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV Pickup and SUV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV.The collaboration with Queensland Pacific Metals will provide GM with a secure, cost-competitive and long-term supply of nickel and cobalt from a free-trade agreement partner and will aid its EV production requirements.GM is determined to go the extra mile to master every aspect of electrification to emerge as the undaunted EV leader. In its ambitious strategy, it has laid out a two-year milestone to scale up capacity between 2023 and 2025. It intends to reach a production volume of 1 million EVs in North America and China each by 2025. GM also plans to do away with tailpipe emissions from all its new light-duty vehicles by 2035 and, thereby, is developing a supply chain and recycling strategy.The company has already formed agreements to secure battery raw materials to support its goal. The partnership with Queensland Pacific Metals will further strengthen the procurement of materials as well as ensure waste reduction and a sustainable supply chain.Recently, to transition to a circular battery ecosystem, GM announced that its investment wing, GM Ventures, has invested in Lithion Recycling Inc.'s Series A financing round, facilitating a new GM-Lithion partnership. Lithion's technology will enable it to recover and reuse raw material in its Ultium battery packs, making the EVs more sustainable and economical.The auto magnate looks geared up to make bold headways in its electrification progress.Story continuesShares of GM have lost 44.6% over the past year compared with its industry’s 29.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGM currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Cummins Inc.

Soon after, Ye’s accounts on Instagram and Twitter were restricted for posting anti-Semitic comments. (Those later posts weren’t specifically directed at Kushner, who is Jewish.)“Getting called out by Kanye on Instagram was not on last week’s bingo card for me,” Kushner, the founder of Thrive Capital, said onstage in response to a question at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York. “We feel really fortunate to work with [SKIMS] in particular and to support Kim and Jens and Emma and all of the people involved.”The beef with Kushner centers on a disparity in their holdings of Kardashian’s company. Ye said he has 5% of shares and was surprised to learn Kushner’s Thrive has 10%. Ye thinks he should have more. His anti-Semitic comments are harder to explain. He had tweeted that he would go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,” an apparent reference to the defense condition DEFCON.“On a personal level and a human level, I think some of the comments that were made, specifically around anti-Semitism, were disappointing to me,” Kushner said at the Bloomberg conference.Ye had elaborated on his views in an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson last week. He again criticized Kushner as well as his brother, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of former President Donald Trump. Ye said a peace agreement Jared helped negotiate between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain was designed just “to make money.” He further criticized the Kushner family’s wealth.Story continuesThe Kanye situation aside, Kushner and a general partner at Thrive Capital, Kareem Zaki, showed optimism for a rebound in the technology industry and for health tech in particular. “I think there will be a reawakening of digital health post-Covid,” he said, in part because of the new digital methods physicians can use to treat patients.Thrive has built and incubated several companies. Zaki, while at Thrive, helped start the health-tech businesses Cedar and Cadence.Another Thrive investment, a real estate financing company called Cadre, said in June that co-founder Ryan Williams was stepping aside from the CEO role. Kushner suggested the move was a sign of Williams’ self-awareness.“He’s really scaled the business to an incredible point,” Kushner said. At the time of his decision, Williams’ mindset was, “I actually think this thing can be so much bigger” and, “How do I bring in someone who is exceptional?” Kushner said. Jared Kaplan, a longtime fintech executive, is the new CEO.The creator economy is another area Kushner identified as a focus. “One of the things that’s really interesting is the growth of the creator,” he said. “That can be around recognizable individuals like Kim Kardashian and SKIMS, which we invested in, but also new people coming up on new mediums and platforms. We invested in Patreon and Twitch, which have enabled a whole new category of individuals.”The relationship between Kushner and Zaki dates back to Harvard University, where they were classmates. Kushner reflected on his time in college, saying the friendships he made there were more important than any major. Kushner and Zaki also said they’re excited to work with someone they didn’t go to school with — former Walt Disney Co.

BUFFALO, N.Y., Oct. 13, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- M&amp;T Bank (NYSE: MTB) announced today that it has earned designation as the sixth largest Small Business Administration (SBA) lender in the nation, extending its 14-year streak of ranking as one of the top 10 in the U.S. During the SBA's 2022 fiscal year, M&amp;T provided 1,440 7(a) loans for a total of $203.8 million to help local small businesses pursue plans to expand and thrive. M&amp;T rose to the sixth position nationally for its total loan volume, even though it only operates in 12 states across the eastern U.S.The impact of M&amp;T's consistently strong SBA performance nationally is felt in the local communities it serves. The bank was the leading small business lender in several markets and ranked highly in many others, including the SBA Districts of:Baltimore: #1 lender with 250 loans for $36.69 millionBuffalo/Rochester: #1 lender with 167 loans for $34.38 millionConnecticut: #2 lender with 75 loans for $9.70 millionDelaware: #1 lender with 52 loans for $7.12 millionNew Jersey: #2 lender with 131 loans for $13.38 millionNew York City: #2 lender with 308 loans for $32.76 millionPhiladelphia: #2 lender with 134 loans for $22.82 millionRichmond: #1 lender (tied) with 39 loans for $4.41 millionSyracuse: #1 lender with 82 loans for $8.56 millionWashington, D.C.: #1 lender with 152 loans for $23.81 million""While we're proud of our longstanding ranking among the top SBA lenders in the country, what matters most to us is meeting the local needs of small businesses in the communities we serve. For us, it's about making a difference in people's lives, helping business owners access funding so they can grow, hire more people and uplift our communities,"" said Christina Brozyna, head of business banking sales and operations.Story continuesHelping Local Small Businesses GrowBehind each of M&amp;T's SBA loans, there's the story of an entrepreneur who is determined to build a business that helps customers, provides jobs and strengthens their neighborhood.Recently, M&amp;T assisted Dr. Uzo Ihenko and his son Kelechi Chillis-Ihenko in accessing SBA lending to accelerate their vision for the Broadway Business Hub, starting with the opening of their UPS Store which will provide a range of business services in East Buffalo. It's one component of a major redevelopment project they're pursuing on Broadway between Michigan and Jefferson Avenues.""Through our experience with M&amp;T Bank, we've seen how much they care about people and helping local businesses grow,"" Dr. Uzo Ihenko said. ""Launching our UPS Store will be a catalyst for our multifaceted project which will grow into a coworking space and new apartments. We're excited about our project's potential to strengthen the East Buffalo community and create opportunities for historically underrepresented entrepreneurs — and now thanks to M&amp;T, we have the small business financing we needed to fuel our momentum.""In Connecticut, Spectrum Machine &amp; Design, an advanced manufacturing and precision machining company, worked with M&amp;T to secure SBA financing for new equipment that enabled the company to take on more work from a major FORTUNE 500 company. Founded in the garage of Connie and Gary Poesnecker in 1999, Spectrum Machine, which specializes in the aerospace and defense industries, has expanded significantly over the years and now occupies a 17,000-square foot facility in Windsor Locks.""Securing SBA lending through M&amp;T Bank helped us unlock new growth opportunities for our company. Their team invested time and energy to build a relationship with us — and importantly, they brought an existing knowledge of manufacturers' needs,"" said Gary Poesnecker. ""The manufacturing industry consistently faces challenging issues, but with reliable partners like M&amp;T, we're able to pursue creative solutions and focus on doing what we do best — leveraging our CNC machining skills to produce complex parts and tooling for our customers.""M&amp;T's Deep Commitment to Local Businesses in New MarketsSince its founding over 165 years ago, M&amp;T has focused on meeting the financing needs of local businesses to ensure they have capital to adopt new equipment and technology, expand operations and grow their workforce. The bank is now bringing its longstanding commitment to small business to new communities where it recently expanded in New England.M&amp;T is showing up in new and different ways for small businesses to provide added support and new programs that enable them to reach new customers, optimize operations and access guidance and expertise.In August, M&amp;T brought its innovative Spotlight Shop to Connecticut, offering local small businesses with an opportunity to market their products from a pop-up space in Bridgeport's popular Captain's Cove Seaport.M&amp;T recently launched its Multicultural Small Business Innovation Lab in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which helps local multicultural business owners access guidance and deepen skills to expand and strengthen their business. M&amp;T is partnering with the University of Bridgeport's Innovation Center to lead the seven-week program and will fund grants of up to $6,000 that will be awarded during the Innovation Lab's pitch competition.""We provide local businesses with the robust capabilities of a large regional bank, but we serve our customers through our longstanding community-bank operating model — which is defined by a deep understanding of our communities, a local workforce that cares deeply about the people they serve and banking solutions designed for the unique needs of local economies,"" Brozyna added.About M&amp;T M&amp;T Bank Corporation is a financial holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York.

319,408ca948-65d9-330e-b76e-be2f46af12e9,MTB,2022-10-13,M&T Bank Corporation (MTB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-mtb-140002890.html,1665583202,STORY,['MTB-PH'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.3 billion, up 49.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.64% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M&amp;T Bank Corporation?For M&amp;T Bank Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that M&amp;T Bank Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that M&amp;T Bank Corporation would post earnings of $3.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.10, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.M&amp;T Bank Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerBank of America (BAC), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.79 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -7.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $23.6 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Bank of America has been revised 0.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.76%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of America will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock market has witnessed stomach-churning volatility so far this year, thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war, Fed’s ultra-hawkish stance and inflationary concerns. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have plunged 19.5%, 24.7% and 33.3%, respectively.Investors are awaiting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will come out tomorrow and offer further insight into whether Fed’s aggressive stance is yielding desired results. The quicker inflation begins to cool, the sooner the Fed can slow the trajectory of interest rate hikes. But the Fed has already hinted that rates are likely to hit 4.40% in 2022 and 4.6% in 2023.The path of rate hikes will determine the odds of a soft landing or recession for the U.S. economy. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the United States is headed for a recession in six-nine months. Amid the Fed’s resolute stance on the contractionary monetary policy, a global financial crisis looms large. Yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered its forecast for 2023 global GDP to 2.7% from the previous estimate of 2.9%.Adopt Value Investing ApproachMarket volatility calls for investors to tread cautiously and rethink their portfolio strategy. Value investing could be one of the most effective investment approaches amid the escalating uncertainty. We have highlighted four value stocks, namely Albemarle Corporation ALB, CNH Industrial CNHI, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. HP and National Fuel Gas Company NFG, which carry high earnings yield and are worth placing your bets on.Value investing takes a long-term view and seeks to gauge the intrinsic value of the companies based on their fundamental strength, earnings potential and financials. Value investors benefit from identifying and buying stocks, which are underestimated by the equity market and are thus trading below their true value, and eventually make handsome returns when the stock price rises toward its intrinsic value to reflect the actual fundamentals.Story continuesUnlock Your Portfolio Value Via Earnings Yield MetricOne of the most common valuation metrics to pick undervalued stocks with solid upside potential is the P/E ratio. However, there’s another interesting ratio that you can consider for ferreting out attractively valued stocks. And that is earnings yield, which is nothing but the reciprocal of the P/E ratio, albeit a little more illuminating than the traditional P/E ratio.Earnings yield is calculated as annual earnings per share (EPS) divided by market price — the inverse of the P/E ratio. This metric measures the anticipated yield (or return) from earnings for each dollar invested in a stock today. While comparing stocks, if other factors are similar, the one with higher earnings yield is considered undervalued, while those with lower earnings yield are seen as overpriced.Earnings yield has the edge over the P/E ratio as the former also facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities. Investors often compare the earnings yield of a stock to the prevailing interest rates, such as the current 10-year Treasury yield, to get a sense of the return on investment it offers compared to virtually risk-free returns.If the yield on a stock is lower than the 10-year Treasury yield, it would be considered overvalued relative to bonds. Conversely, if the yield on the stock is higher, it would be considered undervalued. In this situation, investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor.Selection CriteriaWe have set an Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Day) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.4 Stocks to BuyHere are four of the 131 stocks that made it through the screen:Albemarle: Charlotte-based Albemarle is a premier specialty chemicals company. Albemarle is benefiting from higher volumes in its lithium business. Higher customer demand, new capacity and plant productivity improvements are supporting volumes. The company also remains committed to delivering incremental returns to its shareholders.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Albemarle’s 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 427% and 24%, respectively. ALB surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average being 24.2%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.CNH Industrial: London-based CNH Industrial is one of the leading equipment and services companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of agricultural and construction equipment. Raven Industries and Sampierana buyouts have bolstered the prospects of CNH Industrial's Agriculture and Construction segments, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNH Industrial’s 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 1.5% and 10%, respectively. CNHI surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average being 27.7%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Helmerich &amp; Payne: This Oklahoma-based company is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States &amp; internationally. Its technologically-advanced FlexRigs are able to maintain relatively strong daily-rate margins, giving the firm an edge over its peers. HP’s digitization efforts and strong balance sheet are also praiseworthy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich &amp; Payne’s fiscal 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 98.5% and 8,735%, respectively. HP surpassed earnings estimates in three out of four trailing quarters and missed once, the average being 118.2%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.National Fuel Gas: New York-based National Fuel Gas Company is an integrated natural gas company with operations across all segments of the natural gas industry, including utility, pipeline and storage, production, and marketing.  The acquisition of Shell’s assets, a strong presence in the Appalachian region, and expanding upstream and midstream operations augur well for the company’s growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFG’s fiscal 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 40% and 23%, respectively. The company surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average being 9%. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.

""By applying a high quality patent screen, the QQQS portfolio will focus on smaller-cap companies with a competitive advantage on certain inventions. This will allow investors to customize their market capitalization exposure to companies who are pioneering the future.""Two years ago on October 13, 2020, the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) and Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) were launched to offer investors access to category-defining companies with a known legacy of innovation, as well as the next generation of companies who are just beginning to impact the world. This personalized exposure has resonated with investors, and together QQQM and QQQJ have gathered $5.2 Billion in AUM since launch.2 Now, the addition of QQQS to the Innovation Suite has created a modular set of three ETFs that can be used in together or separately to personalize investor access to companies of all sizes focused on future innovation.Story continuesQQQS will track the Nasdaq Innovators Completion Cap Index™, an intelligent, equal weighted index that uses a patent data screen created by IPR Strategies.  IPR Strategies, a leader in the science of patent valuation, believes that high quality and high value patents represent a future asset and are an early indicator of future positive value. IPR Strategies works with Nasdaq to assign a realistic value to patents based on multiple parameters, including a high commitment to research and development and valuable intellectual property, to source small-cap and micro-cap companies that may be laying the groundwork to become the next industry giants. Given its long-standing expertise in smart beta, Invesco believes that the addition of a thoughtfully composed layer of criteria (patent value) to an overall capitalization screen (small and micro-cap) may be successful in identifying companies with a focus on innovation in their industries.""The future of innovation, as uncovered by the patent screening process, underscores the transformative changes of the companies within their respective industries,"" said Cameron Lilja, Vice President, Global Head of Index Product, Nasdaq.

324,546c3718-4433-3208-b85a-8600606182d1,NDAQ,2022-10-13,Nasdaq (NDAQ) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-ndaq-reports-next-week-140002336.html,1665583202,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[Nasdaq (NDAQ) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis exchange operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.2%.Revenues are expected to be $892.62 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.34% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nasdaq?For Nasdaq, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.77%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nasdaq will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nasdaq would post earnings of $0.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +7.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nasdaq doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the latest and inaugural Comcast Advertising report, programmatic ad growth has risen 80% year over year as marketers increasingly adopt the medium as a way to reach specific audiences more efficiently. As such, publishers need tools that can help them better incorporate non-guaranteed, programmatic demand into their monetization strategy. The challenge, however, is that they also need to be to do this by honoring guaranteed advertisers’ commitments, such as upfront buys.As such, FreeWheel created this new, enhanced offering to address many of these industry trends and needs. Premium video, in particular, provides high value audiences for advertisers, but currently exists in a limited supply. Additionally, balancing yield management across guaranteed and programmatic demand channels is currently a manual and cumbersome process. Case in point: Publishers need a way to maximize the value of each impression, without putting their guaranteed business at risk.FreeWheel’s enhanced, unified yield capability protects the value of high quality, premium video while automating yield optimization. As a result, publishers have greater control over which types of demand are opted in, while providing full transparency and reporting to revenue opportunities.Story continuesAnother core and valuable feature of this new tool is its ability to give publishers another way to access premium, hard-to-obtain inventory that is normally unavailable due to direct sales commitments. While advertisers may have been previously challenged in accessing this inventory, by boosting programmatic demand, FreeWheel provides marketers with additional opportunities to reach their target audiences at scale.""We developed this new, improved industry solution to help solve for and reduce some of the friction and inefficiencies in the TV ad buying process across sales channels,"" said Katy Loria, Chief Revenue Officer, FreeWheel. ""FreeWheel’s new unified yield capability provides smarter demand decisioning so that we can help deliver better results for marketers and publishers, while honoring guaranteed commitments.""A+E Networks is one media leader that has adopted FreeWheel’s unified yield solution and seen positive results, including a +35% increase in cost per thousand (CPM) across replaced impressions, while all guaranteed deals still delivered in full during this period.""One of the beneficial features about FreeWheel’s new unified yield offering is the technology’s ability to balance an increasing demand for non-guaranteed, programmatic while fully delivering on our commitments to our advertiser partners,"" said Tyler Denicola, Vice President, Programmatic Revenue &amp; Partnerships, A+E Networks. ""In doing so, we’ve been able to create more flexible opportunities for our advertisers to unlock new audiences across our premium video portfolio.""About FreeWheelFreeWheel empowers all segments of The New TV Ecosystem.

Furthermore, when a TV ad preceded these types of digital ads, both purchase intent and unaided recall were better than two digital mobile ads alone.""Many of us know instinctually that TV ads are memorable. The jingle that gets stuck in your head, the commercials that make you laugh – all of this is the result of TV’s ability to imprint on your memory in a unique way,"" said James Rooke, President, Comcast Advertising. ""This research validates TV’s memorability, proving ads viewed in the long-form, lean-back TV environment have greater unaided recall and purchase intent versus the same ads shown in a short-form, small-screen digital mobile feed. Engagement is a metric that increasingly matters to our clients, and with this research, we’re showing how powerful TV and streaming are when it comes to building that engagement.""Story continuesIn the study with MediaScience, Comcast Advertising sought to better quantify the engagement of TV and streaming advertising on the ""big screen,"" by exploring how different types of ad exposure impact memory. Viewers were shown 30-second ads in ""mobile digital"" environments, ""TV"" environments, and a combination of the two. Participants were then exposed to an even mix of well-known and unknown brands, and their response was measured by biometrics – including eye tracking, cardiac deceleration and neurometric intensity – as well as post-exposure survey questions.The consumer study investigated how the impact of watching a traditional or streaming TV ad in a ""TV environment"" may differ from a viewer seeing the same ad in a ""mobile digital"" environment on a as measured by awareness, recall and purchase intent. Comcast Advertising extended this comparison to look at the three factors of memory gleaned from existing academic research of memory influencers: attention, connection and repetition – to explore the differences in the ability of a TV environment versus a mobile environment to influence memory and ultimately, advertising effectiveness.In addition to the findings around purchase intent and recall, the study found that:Ads viewed in the TV environment garnered more visual attention as participants watched 71% of the ad, compared to just 30% of the digital mobile ads – likely a result of the full-screen viewing experience and mitigated distractions inherent with the digital experience.Participants rated the creative message better when an ad seen in the TV environment preceded an ad in the digital mobile environment.On first exposure, there was 3.4 times better recall for TV ads vs. digital mobile ads, compared to 2.3 times better recall for well known brands – suggesting that viewing ads in the TV environment gave brands the best opportunity to make a first impression and better impact a consumer’s formation of brand memories.As revealed through this research, in the high-quality, long-form, full-screen TV environment, where visual attention is high, brands are more likely to be remembered – which influences consumers as they move towards purchase and improves cross-screen advertising that may follow. When it comes to branding, advertisers should consider how their ads stimulate attention, make a connection, and use repetition – enhancing memory, and thus, efficiency.""Once again we see the power of cross-platform synergy,"" said Dr. Duane Varan, CEO, MediaScience. ""Here, social media and digital video work best when they activate memory structures built through the kind of brand equity that TV delivers. It’s a powerful combination.""To read the full report, ""TV Makes Memories,"" please click here.About Comcast AdvertisingComcast Advertising is the advertising division of Comcast Cable.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.PGT Innovations (PGTI) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PGTI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Investors should also recognize that PGTI has a P/B ratio of 2.45.

PGTI's P/B has been as high as 2.63 and as low as 1.72, with a median of 2.22, over the past year.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PGTI has a P/S ratio of 1. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.01.Finally, our model also underscores that PGTI has a P/CF ratio of 11.44. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PGTI's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 13.48.

Shares have lost about 17.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Oracle due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Oracle Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues RiseOracle reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $1.03 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 3.74%. The bottom line remained unchanged year over year (up 8% at constant currency or cc).Management had guided non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) to grow in the range of 1-5% year over year at cc and be in the band of $1.04-$1.08 per share.Revenues increased 18% (up 23% at cc) year over year to $11.44 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.2%. The top-line performance was mainly driven by strength in the cloud business.For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle had anticipated total revenues to grow in the range of 17-19% year over year at USD and 20-22% at cc.Revenues by OfferingsOracle’s Cloud services and license support revenues (73% of total revenues) in the reported quarter increased 14% year over year (up 20% at cc) to $8.41 billion. The upside can be attributed to continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) services.Breakup of Cloud Services &amp; License Support RevenuesApplications revenues (contributed 47.7% to total cloud services and license support revenues) amounted to $4.01 billion, up 32% year over year (up 37% at cc).Infrastructure-related revenues (52.3% of total cloud services and license support revenues) were $4.4 billion, up 2% on a year-over-year basis (up 7% at cc).Cloud license and on-premise license revenues (8% of total revenues) increased 11% year over year (up 19% at cc) to $904 million.Hardware revenues (7% of total revenues) were $763 million, which remained unchanged year over year, (up 5% at cc).Services revenues (12% of total revenues) rose 74% (up 84% at cc) to $1.36 billion.Story continuesRevenues by GeographyRevenues from the Americas (representing 62.8% of total revenues) increased 35.2% year over year to $7.192 billion.Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa (23.5%) declined 3.3% from the year-ago quarter figure to $2.69 billion.Revenues from the Asia Pacific (13.6%) declined 3.8% from the year-ago quarter level to $1.856 billion.Expanding Clientele Remains NoteworthyManagement noted that the strategic back-office cloud applications business increased 33% at cc and now has $5.8 billion in annualized revenues. Management noted that revenues from Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM and NetSuite ERP were up 38%, 26% and 30%, respectively.Consumption revenues for OCI services, which include Autonomous Database, soared 103% at cc. Cloud customer consumption revenues increased 92% year over year.Additionally, the company is witnessing strong growth in Cloud HCM, which is increasingly being purchased as part of the company’s ERP cloud application suite. Further, the migration of several large-scale SAP customers to Fusion ERP cloud and Fusion HCM remains a tailwind.Expanding clientele is enabling the company to maintain its leading position in the cloud ERP market. Management is optimistic regarding the latest Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, HCM and EPM applications.The next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, supported by ML, is witnessing steady traction. New product introductions, including new OCI managed services, are likely to boost growth in this category. The autonomous database in Gen2 public cloud infrastructure is witnessing a healthy uptake.Oracle’s latest Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering is gaining traction among on-premise customers. The latest wins include Deutsche Bank, City of Atlanta and State of Kansas.Some noteworthy deal wins for OCI during the reported quarter are ABN AMRO, Generalli, Data Intensity and Informatica among others.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP total operating expenses increased 8% year over year (up 11% at cc) to $6.25 billion.Non-GAAP operating income during the reported quarter was $5.59 billion, up 3% year over year (up 8% at cc).Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 123 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 47%.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Aug 31, 2022, Oracle had cash &amp; cash equivalents and marketable securities of $10.44 billion compared with $21.8 billion as of May 31, 2022.Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended Aug 31, 2022 amounted to $10.54 billion and $5.37 billion, respectively.Share Repurchases &amp; DividendsOracle repurchased 7.5 million shares, worth approximately $599 million, during the fiscal first quarter.The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid out to stockholders of record, after the close of business on Oct 12, 2022, with a payment date of Oct 25, 2022.Q2 GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2023, total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow between 21% and 23% in cc and 15% and 17% in USD.Total cloud growth, again including Cerner, is expected to grow in the range of 46% to 50% in cc and 42% to 46% in USD.Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 1% to 5% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency due to currency headwinds. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to decline 1% to 5% and be between $1.16 and $1.20.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.93% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Oracle has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Oracle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

333,9623f669-b743-3bce-84eb-502427022424,MU,2022-10-13,TSMC Cuts Capital Spending 10% in a Warning for Tech Sector,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-earnings-top-estimates-chip-053326081.html,1665653153,STORY,"['2330.TW', 'TSM']","[(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares had their biggest jump in three months after the company slashed its 2022 capital spending target by roughly 10% and reported better-than-expected earnings.Most Read from BloombergA Tense Pay Dispute Overshadows Nintendo’s Upcoming Bayonetta 3Trump Prosecutors See Evidence for Obstruction ChargesWeed Is Coming to Circle K Gas Stations in US Next Year$200 Diesel Puts Biden in an Ugly CornerTrump Special Master Has ‘No Patience’ for Records SpatsTSMC said it expects to spend about $36 billion in 2022 on capital equipment, down from at least $40 billion previously. The company, which reported better-than-estimated third-quarter net income of NT$280.9 billion ($8.8 billion), is projecting revenue of $19.9 billion to $20.7 billion in the December quarter, though that assumes certain US dollar expectations at a time Asian currencies have weakened.Asia’s semiconductor sector as a whole rose following a rebound in American peers after hot US inflation data. The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index gained as much as 3.6% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed 2.9% higher. TSMC’s stock rose 4.3% in Taipei on Friday.“The time to start buying TSMC stock for absolute upside has now arrived,” JPMorgan analysts said after TSMC’s earnings. Shares had tanked earlier in the week, taking its market capitalization to about $320 billion from more than $550 billion in January.TSMC and its peers are grappling with Washington’s sweeping restrictions on doing business with China, which are sending shock waves through the global semiconductor industry. Applied Materials Inc., a leading producer of chip-making equipment, slashed its forecast for the fourth quarter, while Intel Corp. is said to be preparing to fire thousands. Shares in European gear maker ASML Holding NV, whose top customer is TSMC, fell as much as 3% Thursday.The moves unveiled last week are the Biden administration’s most aggressive yet as it tries to stop China from developing technological capabilities it sees as a threat. The actions, which have incensed Beijing, threaten to disrupt a global economy already dealing with a potential global recession, soaring inflation and lingering supply snarls.Story continues“The company’s 10% cut in full-year capital spending target implies prolonged weakness in smartphone and PC chip demand,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said.Executives said that they won a license from the US to continue operating and building out their 16 nanometer and 28 nanometer lines at Nanjing in China, joining companies from SK Hynix Inc. to Samsung Electronics Co. in securing narrow exemptions to the chip curbs from Washington.The grants allow Asia’s three largest chipmakers to maintain their existing plants and operations in the world’s biggest semiconductor market, for instance by buying, importing and upgrading American tools. They may also be allowed to expand existing facilities covered by the licenses -- which in TSMC’s case involves more mature nodes that are several generations behind state of-the-art. It’s unclear, however, if foreign firms will be allowed to move up the technology ladder, or have American employees working on the lines in China.TSMC to the World: We Have No Good News for You: Tim CulpanThe Biden administration measures limit the ability of companies that use US technology to sell products to China. They include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company.The restrictions make it more difficult for chipmakers to move their inventories and hit TSMC more severely than previous actions by the US, Fubon Research analysts led by Sherman Shang said in a note this week. The curbs mean about 5%-8% of TSMC’s total revenue will likely be restricted, they said. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates TSMC could lose more than 10% of its annual sales because of the restrictions.It’s “too early to provide a specific number, however the inventory correction will likely see its biggest impact sometime in the first half of 2023,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told analysts on a conference call. The impact of the US curbs will be manageable, he said.Still, Taiwan’s largest company is betting on its massive size and industry-leading technology to navigate its biggest challenges in years. Hsinchu, Taiwan-based TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, producing for the likes of Qualcomm Inc., Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., all of which sell a significant portion of their products into the Chinese market.On Thursday, executives reaffirmed their long-term targets for revenue and declared 2023 a year of growth. TSMC also pledged to continue expanding around the globe as needed.“TSMC’s guidance of at least 43% year-over-year sales growth and 59.5% gross margin is above consensus estimates, and indicate very mild immediate impact from the new US restrictions,” Shum said.The outlook for the electronics industry had begun to darken even before the upheaval engendered by Biden’s curbs.Macroeconomic shocks have suppressed consumer demand and business spending, while unsold inventory among PC vendors built up. Third-quarter shipments of desktop and laptop computers slumped 15%, according to IDC data, and chip companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have said they were surprised by the speed and sharpness of the downturn in demand. Memory makers Micron Technology Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. have announced cutbacks in output of as much as 30% to try and stabilize prices.TSMC may not be able to rely on sustained demand for products of Apple, its main customer, whose growth has benefited the Taiwanese manufacturer for years.While the California company has launched new types of chips to boost the performance of its devices, it has recently backed off plans to increase production of its new iPhones, raising further questions about underlying electronics demand.(Updates with shares)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJohn Mack, Who Led Morgan Stanley Into a Crisis, Regrets LittleUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages OnMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysHow Gamers Beat NFTsA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold Market©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Kentucky Fried Wishes is a community-based grant program that encourages eligible* KFC restaurant employees to positively impact their local communities by nominating a non-profit organization to receive $10,000 to support a community development project.""Year after year, we continue to be inspired by the amazing Kentucky Fried Wishes nominations submitted by KFC restaurants across the nation. We are proud to award a record half a million dollars in grant funding this year,"" said Emma Horn, Executive Director of the KFC Foundation. ""It's extra meaningful to celebrate these non-profits during the Colonel's birthday month. He would be proud of how KFC team members are investing in their communities and supporting organizations that are doing some finger lickin' good!""KFC's Founder, Colonel Harland Sanders, would have been 132 years old on September 9. Inspired by the Colonel and his guiding principle to ""never pass anybody up,"" the KFC Foundation carries on his legacy of doing good, which is why the KFC Foundation awards Kentucky Fried Wishes grant recipients around his birthday.This year's non-profit grant recipients span 25 different states and support various causes and communities, including:Family &amp; Children's Association was nominated by KFC restaurant employees for its long-lasting impact on the youth in Long Island, NY. The local KFC general manager has even employed five residents from the organization to work at the franchisee-owned restaurant. The Family &amp; Children's Association works to protect and strengthen Long Island's most vulnerable children, families, seniors and communities. The Kentucky Fried Wishes grant will be used to fund an outdoor healing garden, designed to improve the mental and physical well-being of the residents.Story continuesCommunity Bike Works, based in Allentown, PA, connects youth ages 9-18 with adult mentors who teach them life lessons through their Earn a Bike program. While working on their bikes, students practice life skills by working collaboratively, solving problems, learning perseverance and experiencing the satisfaction of turning a broken bike into a functional one. Their Kentucky Fried Wishes grant will help purchase bicycle helmets and the necessary tools for bicycle mechanic training.Live Like Madison is a cause that was created in memory of 7-year-old Madison Fedak's fight against cancer. Madison's ""never give up"" attitude inspired the organization's programs that promote courage and comfort for children who suffer from the disease. The Kentucky Fried Wishes grant will help fund toy chests housed at three children's hospitals in the Laurinburg, NC, area.In 2021, the Kentucky Fried Wishes program donated $110,000 in grants and made 11 nonprofit organizations' wishes come true. This year, the program funded more than quadruple the wishes due to the continued support of KFC franchisees, the KFC Corporation, and participation in the Round Up fundraising program at local KFC restaurants. To learn more about the 50 Kentucky Fried Wishes grant recipients, visit kfcfoundation.org.The KFC Foundation supports and empowers KFC restaurant employees to be their best selves by providing education opportunities, hardship assistance and more. The Kentucky Fried Wishes program is one of five charitable programs that the KFC Foundation offers KFC restaurant employees across the U.S. including the REACH Educational Grant Program, Rise with GEDWorks, KFC Family Fund and MyChange.Operating independently from KFC Corporation and led by a board including KFC franchisees, the KFC Foundation receives its financial support from Round Up fundraising and its annual donation program, a voluntary program where KFC franchisees elect to contribute a portion of their restaurant sales of Secret Recipe Fries to engage in and support the Foundation's initiatives.*To be eligible for Kentucky Fried Wishes and any of the KFC Foundation's charitable assistance programs, employees must work at a KFC restaurant in the U.S. that is participating in the KFC Foundation's 2022 annual donation program.References to ""KFC"" ""KFC Family"" ""we"" and ""our"" refer to KFC's corporately owned restaurants and independently owned and operated franchises.

Today, the Aon PEP is the industry leader with more than 40 employers providing 401(k) benefits to over 30,000 employees, helping them shape better retirement decisions. Aon, a leading global professional services firm, reports participating employers are from a diverse mix of industries including biotech and life sciences, manufacturing, services, consumer products, energy, and technology and transportation.Participants are benefiting from a higher performing, more efficient 401(k) program, with employees able to accumulate up to 11 percent more retirement savings during their career due to lower fees compared to typical 401(k) benefit programs.* Within the Aon PEP, ""all-in"" participant fees can be less than half of those paid in traditional 401(k)s according to data from Brightscope and current Aon PEP costs. ""The benefits of transitioning to a pooled employer plan – half the costs, reduced time commitment from corporate staff, improved governance and high-quality retirement planning options – have become material for employers and their employees,"" said Rick Jones, senior partner in Aon's Wealth Solutions. ""We expect more than half of U.S. employers to merge their traditional 401(k)s into pooled employer plans by 2030.""The combined scale in PEPs help lower plan costs, including record-keeping and investment management fees. Beneficiaries also have easier access to investment tools and education services to better prepare for retirement.From the employer perspective, pooled employer plans reduce staff time and resources dedicated to plan management, compliance and governance (i.e., elimination of many tasks such as government filings, plan audits, etc.). PEPs also reduce fiduciary and litigation risks.Story continuesJasmine Simkins, CPP, SHRM-CP, director of human resource operations for West Marine, a marine retailer that joined the Aon PEP in 2021, said her company has saved about 65 percent of its 401(k) program costs, which in turn goes right back into what they can offer employees. ""Our crew members are saving, we're saving, and it makes it easier to offer bigger and better things that will help us with retention and getting the right talent in place,"" Simkins said. ""Not only does it help us as a company, but it's helping crew members understand their investments and they're having a better experience with the program.""""The Aon PEP offers a significant opportunity to enhance retirement security for American workers and build a more resilient workforce across the country,"" said Byron Beebe, senior partner in Aon's Wealth Solutions. ""It provides efficiency and scale while maintaining individual employer autonomy to define matching and other contribution levels, vesting rules and other key plan design features.""Aon hopes to offer the same retirement benefits to U.S. non-profit workers soon to provide this underserved market with the potential for stronger retirement outcomes. The firm urges Congress to enact bipartisan legislation referred to as Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2022, which, among other things, would allow 403(b) plans to join pooled employer plans.""Employees and employers in the non-profit sector should also benefit from pooled employer plans,"" Jones said. ""We strongly encourage Congress to enact legislation that allows 403(b) plan beneficiaries to take advantage of this innovation to bolster retirement savings.""To read more information about the Aon PEP, click here.*The performance modeling shows a hypothetical employee participating in the Aon PEP would save $1,347,000 throughout their career compared to $1,210,000 for a worker in a traditional 401(k) with higher fees. It assumes a 25-year-old employee with $50,000 starting salary, $3,000 starting account balance, 4 percent annual pay increases, age 67 retirement, 3 percent initial savings rate with auto-escalation to 10 percent, invested in a diversified S&amp;P through target date fund, and employer matching 100 percent on first 3 percent and 50 percent on next 2 percent.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the REIT sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Dividend Stocks. Over the years, the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector in the US expanded into a wide range of diverse assets. In 2021, the sector performed well after recovering from the ills of the pandemic a year before. Morgan Stanley mentioned in a report that global listed real estate markets returned 27.2% in 2021, citing data from FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. In addition to this, the REIT sector also contributes significantly to the national GDP. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the sector generates nearly $197 billion in labor income through 3 million jobs. Moreover, the REITs in the US own real estate assets worth over $3.5 trillion.The sector is increasingly becoming popular among investors as it offers relatively high dividend yields, which is rewarding in times of financial instability. From 2015 to 2020, the average dividend yield of the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index was 3.7%, compared with a 2% average yield of the S&amp;P 500, as reported by S&amp;P Global. Besides offering high yields, these companies earn stable streams of income from long-tenant leases and also distribute 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, distributed dividends and interest payments supported $26.1 billion in labor income during the second quarter of 2022. The report also mentioned that the sector distributed dividends worth over $92.3 billion in 2021.Over the years, the returns of the REIT sector are also worth noticing as it outperformed its peers. As reported by CBRE Investment Management, US REITs delivered an average annual return of 10.8% in the last 20 years ending November 2021. In comparison, other global equities returned 6.8% during the same period. This year, dividend stocks like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are gaining ground among investors due to their decades-long dividend growth streaks and strong balance sheets. However, we will discuss the best REIT dividend stocks in this article.Story continues10 Best REIT Dividend StocksStuart Monk / shutterstock.comOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks from the REIT sector that pay dividends to shareholders.

Rowe Price's behalf, will purchase and ""vault"" carbon allowances from government-regulated ""cap and trade"" compliance markets.Because the number of allowances is capped, keeping them off the market means fewer are available for purchase by other market participants who would otherwise use them and continue polluting. This ""vaulting"" of the permits effectively decreases overall carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions while providing a quantifiable, verifiable carbon reduction.Climate Vault will then convert the value of vaulted allowances to fund cutting-edge carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology that will eliminate historical carbon emissions, an essential step to slowing and reversing climate change. In this way, Climate Vault creates a virtuous cycle that not only removes carbon emissions from the atmosphere, but also helps carbon removal technologies become more scalable, viable, and profitable.""As we seek to manage our environmental impact by embedding and extending our ESG practices, Climate Vault's unique approach to offsetting carbon emissions will enable us to reduce our carbon footprint today while also supporting innovation to remove greenhouse gases forever,"" says Gaby Infante, T. Rowe Price's director of corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG).""Unlike traditional voluntary carbon offset methods, the idea of purchasing allowances from the regulated market and ultimately funding carbon removal technologies was very appealing,"" Infante added. ""Rather than just capping emissions, Climate Vault's ‘from reduction to removal' method ensures that carbon emissions are actually being eliminated.""Additionally, to tap in to the desire of T. Rowe Price's workforce to make a difference and adopt more sustainable practices in their personal lives, the firm is hosting a giving campaign for Climate Vault. Associates are invited to use Climate Vault's CO2 calculator to calculate their personal carbon footprint and donate to Climate Vault, which will be matched by T. Rowe Price, to neutralize it.Story continues""We are excited to work with T. Rowe Price in support of their sustainability goals,"" said Michael Greenstone, cofounder of Climate Vault, Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, and former chief economist for President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. ""Climate Vault provides a credible and transparent solution for organizations interested in reducing emissions and supporting innovation, and we are proud to be working with global leaders like T. Rowe Price to build a better future, together.""ABOUT T. ROWE PRICEFounded in 1937, Baltimore-based T.

351,1d7fcd70-1740-35bf-830e-dc6dc3b5109d,OXY,2022-10-13,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-occidental-petroleum-110042889.html,1665658842,STORY,['OXY'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.1bUS$7.56bUS$3.25bUS$3.12bUS$3.06bUS$3.03bUS$3.03bUS$3.05bUS$3.08bUS$3.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -2.04%Est @ -0.83%Est @ 0.01%Est @ 0.6%Est @ 1.02%Est @ 1.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$10.2kUS$6.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$31bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$21bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$52b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$65.1, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.431. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

To skip our detailed analysis of Icahn's history, his investment strategy, and hedge fund performance, go directly and see Carl Icahn Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks.Carl Icahn is an American financier and currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Icahn Capital LP, an investment management firm headquartered in New York. Through the years, Icahn has garnered a reputation as a corporate raider, and has made his way to the Forbes 400 with a current net worth of $18.1 billion.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Icahn amassed a $250 million profit off of Twitter after billionaire Elon Musk offered to finally close his $44 billion purchase of the social media platform. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk had officially agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, causing the stock price to skyrocket. However, soon after, Musk reneged on his offer, prompting Twitter's stock price to fall drastically. This resulted in Twitter suing the SpaceX CEO in order to enforce the purchase. While the legal battle was ensuing,  Icahn had quietly been purchasing stakes in Twitter Inc. while the stock price was depleted, and managed to have a collective stake of nearly $500 million, purchasing the shares while they were in the mid-$30s. On October 4, Musk proposed to move forward with the deal, causing the Twitter stock to jump 22% to $52 per share. This resulted in Icahn making an estimated profit of more than $250 million. Icahn knew that Musk would inevitably proceed with the Twitter deal, since it was unlikely that he would risk going to court, especially when the cards were stacked so heavily against him.Carl Icahn of Icahn CapitalAs of the second quarter of 2022, Icahn Capital has an incredibly diversified portfolio with significant stakes in the financial, basic materials, utilities, services, consumer goods, healthcare, and other industries.

We’re very much in the first phase, though, the give phase.”But when the Fed does switch away from hiking rates, the ‘get’ may be substantial – and Cramer recommends picking up some relevant stocks now, while markets generally are down, in preparation for a later true rally.Cramer has made some specific calls on this end, and we’ve used the TipRanks databank to pull up the details on two of them; here they are, presented along with commentary from the Wall Street analysts.Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)The first ‘Cramer pick’ we’ll look at is Valero Energy, a major producer and distributor of refined fuels. Valero works in the North American, Caribbean, and UK markets, and operates 15 refiners in the US, Canada, and the UK, along with a 50 megawatt wind farm and 11 ethanol biofuel plants. The company is the second largest producer of both corn ethanol and renewable diesel fuels on the global markets.Valero ran net earnings losses through 2020, but in 2Q21 the company turned to profitability – and has seen earnings and revenues both rise since then. In the last reported quarter, 2Q22, both the top and bottom lines saw major jumps. Revenues hit $51.6 billion, up 86% from the year-ago quarter, and diluted EPS rose to $11.36, from just 63 cents one year prior. The company had a total adjusted net quarterly income attributable to shareholders of $4.6 billion.Story continuesThe biggest support for Valero’s strong 2Q22 performance came from the company’s refining segment, which saw revenues increase from just $349 million in 2Q21 to $6.2 billion in 2Q22. Per the end of the second quarter, Valero reported total debt of $10.9 billion and cash on hand of $5.4 billion, compared to $13 billion of debt and $2.3 billion of cash one year earlier.Valero has maintained its dividend in recent years, and the current payment, 98 cents per common share quarterly, or $3.92 annualized, yields a 3.5%.Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, analyst Connor Lynagh sees Valero with a clear path to maintain profits, writing: “On the most important debate right now — demand destruction — VLO's commentary was upbeat, suggesting limited evidence that product demand is softening in response to high prices. VLO seems well-positioned to navigate continued market choppiness and capitalize on the opportunities potentially opened by Europe's desire to wean itself off Russian refined products…”""We continue to like shares here, but acknowledge that leading edge economic data points and evidence of the magnitude and duration of a potential recession will be the key driver of share price performance. For now, shareholders can simply count on VLO management to generate and return substantial sums of cash,"" the analyst summed up.To this end, Lynagh rates VLO an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $140 price target shows his confidence in a one-year upside potential of ~29%. (To watch Lynagh’s track record, click here)So, that’s Morgan Stanley's view, what does the rest of the Street make of Valero's prospects? All are on board, as it happens. The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a unanimous 11 Buys. Moreover, the $144.27 average target, suggests shares have room for ~33% growth in the year ahead. (See VLO stock forecast on TipRanks)Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY)For the second stock, we’ll stick with the energy industry and look at Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest hydrocarbon exploration and production firms in the business. Occidental has hydrocarbon production ops in the US, North Africa, and the Middle East, and its activities include midstream transport and power generation. In addition to petroleum and petroleum products, Occidental also works in industrial chemicals, producing chlor-alkalis, vinyls, and chlorinated organic chemicals. And on a third important track, the company has a Low Carbon Venture, aimed at transforming the use of CO2 emissions to a sustainable model.Occidental’s top line revenues in the last reported quarter, 2Q22, hit $10.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. This solid result led to further sound financials in the drill downs. Cash from operations was listed at $5.3 billion, and free cash flow came in at $4.2 billion. The company repaid some 19% of its total debt in quarter, and was still able to repurchase 18 million shares for $1.1 billion (as of August 1, 2022). The company increases its shareholder return with a modest 13-cent common share dividend, paid out quarterly.Shares in OXY have dramatically outperformed the overall markets this year. OXY is up 107%, compared to the 25% drop in the S&amp;P 500 and the 20% drop in the Dow Jones. Yet, according to Cramer, OXY ""could have some upside here."" The company’s position as a producer of an essential product, and its willingness to monetize the more socially acceptable ‘low carbon’ track, have undergirded its share strength.Writing from Truist, 5-star analyst Neal Dingmann believes that Occidental can continue to both maintain profits and pay down debt, improving its overall position and its leverage.“Occidental continues to maximize its diversified portfolio resulting in ~$4B of quarterly FCF, that the company has prudently used to materially pay down debt to $22B recently from nearly $36B just a year ago. The much improved leverage has allowed OXY to increase shareholder returns (base dividend and buybacks)… We forecast the company to continue with their ~20 rig US onshore program that along with the GoM and international operations should result in mid-single digit growth, by our estimates,” Dingmann opined.Looking ahead from this bullish stance, Dingmann rates OXY shares a Buy, while his $105 price target implies a potential upside of ~64% for the year ahead. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here)Overall, OXY gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 8 Buys, 6 Holds, and a single Sell set in the three months. The stock is selling for $63.74, and the average price target, now at $78.14, implies a one-year upside potential of ~22%.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Ulta Beauty's (NASDAQ:ULTA) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Ulta Beauty is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.43 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$4.9b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Thus, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 43%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 18% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ulta Beauty compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Ulta Beauty's ROCE Trending?Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Ulta Beauty. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 43%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 62% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.What We Can Learn From Ulta Beauty's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that Ulta Beauty is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with a respectable 96% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Ulta Beauty   you'll probably want to know about.Ulta Beauty is not the only stock earning high returns.

In October 2020, Vertex discontinued the phase II study on VX-814 for AATD, based on the liver enzyme elevations observed and the determination that it would be difficult to safely achieve targeted exposure levels. In June 2021, Vertex decided not to pursue late-stage development of VX-864 for AATD. The decision was taken despite a phase II study on the candidate achieving its primary endpoint. Though the data provided proof of mechanism, the company believed that the magnitude of the treatment effect observed in the study was unlikely to lead to any substantial clinical benefit and thus it was not feasible to advance it to pivotal development.Vertex said that VX-634 is the first of the next set of molecules with better potency and drug-like properties than the older AAT correctors. Clinical studies on some other AAT correctors are expected to begin in 2023.Additionally, Vertex will begin a 48-week phase II study of VX-864 in a few weeks’ time to evaluate if longer-term treatment with VX-864 can result in polymer clearance from the liver and lead to greater increases in functional AAT levels in the plasma. The earlier phase II study on VX-64 did not address the candidate’s effects on the levels of liver polymer, an important clinical endpoint.Story continuesVertex currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked biotech stocks are Castle Biosciences CSTL, Codiak BioSciences CDAK and Kamada KMDA, all with a Zacks Rank #1.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $27 million, the contract is expected to get completed by April 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be responsible for installing the data transfer unit and Defensive Electronic Countermeasure System Replacement Phase III ARC-210 components into the CH-53K aircraft.The company will also be engaged in providing support flight planning and testing of the components and supportability products. A major portion of the work will be executed in Stratford, CT and Patuxent River, MD.Benefits of the ContractCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats.Among other combat arsenals and weaponries, military helicopters have been gaining importance owing to advancements and the integration of new tactical and logistical features. This has provided ample opportunities for Lockheed Martin to win production and modification contracts for helicopters in recent times. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such contract wins are likely to drive revenues from the Rotary and Mission Systems business segment, which comprises the Sikorsky helicopters.ProspectsThe United States, which is the largest exporter of military weaponries worldwide, is also strengthening military resources. This is quite evident from the fiscal 2023 budget proposal worth $773 billion put forward by the Biden administration for the Department of Defense, with $56.5 billion planned investments in combat aircraft. Impressively, the defense budget request reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2022 enacted amount.Such solid budgetary provisions should benefit Lockheed along with other defense manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Boeing BA and Textron TXT, which also bear expertise in manufacturing military aircraft.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. It also enables warfighters to accomplish missions under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%.

This reflects a solid improvement of 31.8% in commercial shipments from the previous year’s tally. However, defense shipments indicate a drop of 2.7% year over year.Combining both the segments, Boeing’s total deliveries in the third quarter were 148 units compared with the 122 units delivered in the year-ago period. Strong commercial delivery numbers are likely to bolster BA’s top line in the third quarter.Commercial Deliveries Remain a Key ContributorBoeing reported commercial deliveries of 112 airplanes in the third quarter of 2022, which increased from the prior-year tally of 85. This was primarily driven by solid 737 deliveries.The shipments of 737 totaled 88 compared with 66 in the year-ago period, registering growth of 33.3% year over year. Boeing delivered nine 767 jets in the quarter, two jets less than the year-ago quarter’s tally.The shipments of the 777 model totaled six, unchanged compared with the previous year’s third-quarter tally. The delivery figure of 747 was nil in the quarter compared with the last year’s two figures.Boeing vs. AirbusA comparative analysis of Boeing’s archrival Airbus SE’s EADSY 2022 commercial aircraft indicates that the latter came ahead of Boeing in terms of delivery numbers. Airbus delivered 140 commercial aircraft in the third quarter compared with Boeing’s 112 in the same period.However, the year-over-year growth rate of both the companies has a different story, with Boeing’s deliveries indicating an improvement of an impressive 31.8%. Meanwhile, EADSY registered growth of 10.2%, indicating that BA is on a better growth trajectory.Defense Deliveries DipBoeing reported defense deliveries of 36 airplanes in the third quarter of 2022, which decreased from the prior-year tally of 37.The shipments of AH-64 Apache (remanufactured) deliveries decreased to eight compared with the year-ago period’s tally of 11, while the delivery of AH-64 Apache (new) increased to seven compared with four in the prior year. The company delivered one CH-47 Chinook (new) jet in the third quarter compared with the six jets shipped in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesThe shipments of F-15 Models included four jets compared with three in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the delivery of the KC-46 Tanker decreased by two jets from the previous-year figure to one jet in the third quarter of 2022.The delivery of F/A-18 Models came in at three compared with four in the year-ago period, while the delivery of P-8 Models decreased by one jet to four in the third quarter of 2022.Peer ProspectsJet makers who are yet to report their delivery numbers are Textron TXT and Embraer S.A. ERJ.In the last reported quarter, Embraer delivered 32 jets comprising 11 commercial and 21 executive (12 light and nine midsize) jets. The backlog at the end of the second quarter was $17.8 billion for Embraer.The long-term earnings growth rate for Embraer is pegged at 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ’s 2022 earnings implies an improvement of 460% from the prior-year reported figure.Textron delivered 48 jets in the last reported quarter, up from 44 in the year-ago quarter. Textron also delivered 35 commercial turboprops, up from 33 in the second quarter of 2021.The long-term earnings growth rate for Textron stands at 12.5%.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has lost 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of -1.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.46 points to a change of +6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.55 indicates a change of +3.6% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $10.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.7%. The $42.38 billion and $43.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.6% and +2.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $0.70 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.26%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.49%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of $1.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.86, delivering a surprise of 7.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.PepsiCo , which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, posted revenues of $21.97 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $20.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PepsiCo shares have lost about 6.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -24.7%.What's Next for PepsiCo?While PepsiCo has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.67 on $26.58 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.66 on $83.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Beverages - Soft drinks is currently in the bottom 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Coca-Cola (KO), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 25.This world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.5%.

The advancements in technology have not only improved the quality of life for individuals but have also resulted in improved productivity and efficiency across almost all aspects of life.According to a report recently published by McKinsey &amp; Company, the latest trends in the technology revolve around 14 major technologies, with clean energy, mobility, and connectivity leading the trends in terms of the investments made during 2021. Clean energy technologies focused on the whole energy value chain, from power generation to storage and distribution, were at the forefront with $257 billion investment last year. Other major trends include applied AI, Cloud, and edge computing, Web3, and immersive reality technologies, among others.The companies picked in this list are at the forefront of their market segments and industries and hold significant competitive advantage over their peers based on strong technological capabilities. The companies have strong fundamentals and have exhibited high growth in the past with the potential to make breakthroughs in the future as well.Despite the growing investments and the increasing importance of technology in our lives, the technology sector and the stocks of the companies that are part of this sector have not fared well in the recent past. The Nasdaq-100 index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, was down year-to-date by nearly 35%, as of October 11, 2022.Global markets have been going through a rough patch with fears of a recession due to inflation and aggressive monetary policies implemented by central banks. On September 21, the US central bank raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time and signaled further increases in the future.Story continuesGiven the decline in the market, it could be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of leading companies across many different sectors and not just technology alone.

(NASDAQ:INTU) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-intuit-inc-nasdaq-intu-110121031.html,1665658881,STORY,['INTU'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) recent performance, when its stock has declined 15% over the past month. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuit's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuit is:13% = US$2.1b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Intuit's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Intuit's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 15% seen over the past five years by Intuit.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Intuit's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 25% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is INTU fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Intuit Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Intuit has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 32% (or a retention ratio of 68%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Intuit has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 22%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Intuit's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

At Investor Day 2022, Intuit Chief Technology Officer, Marianna Tessel, provided a deep dive into Intuit’s platform architecture that enables the company to accelerate innovation at scale for more than 100 million customers.""As the AI-driven expert platform, Intuit is rapidly innovating to solve our customers’ most important financial problems,"" said Tessel. ""Our platform, powered by a core set of technology capabilities, enables us to move faster than ever. By tapping into the most modern building blocks and leveraging Intuit’s technology platform, our teams are creating new products and services for our customers at an unparalleled speed.""Intuit’s Platform Enables Rapid InnovationAt the foundation of Intuit’s financial technology platform architecture is a modern SaaS development environment that has led to a 6X increase in development velocity since FY20, enabling developers to deliver code fast, with quality, security and compliance built-in. And, it’s made it possible for Intuit to accelerate AI at scale, resulting in 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and 730 million AI-driven customer interactions each year.Key enabling technologies within the platform drive Intuit’s lines of business and operations for security, data infrastructure, AI infrastructure, core, customer growth and engagement, and business logic for building applications that can be used wherever customers are (mobile, web, voice and, in the future, the metaverse), and more. These capabilities enable thousands of Intuit technologists across the globe to share, experiment, and collaborate on mission-based teams to solve customer problems.Story continuesFor example:AI Infrastructure - the company’s investment in a robust AI infrastructure to ""democratize"" AI has made it possible for technologists (software developers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, data analysts, etc.) across the company to build AI capabilities into Intuit products at scale for customers. With reusable AI services and native experiences, existing models can be applied to power multiple use cases. Rather than starting from scratch to build point solutions to particular problems, developers can tap into AI-ready components (e.g., reusable models for auto complete, financial error detection, natural language processing, user interface design, and more).DevOps/AIOps - Intuit is an industry leader in open source infrastructure tools built on cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes and Argo. Acquired and developed by Intuit, the open source behind the Argo project has been used by more than 1,000 companies. Just this month, the company introduced a new open source project—Numaproj—to drive the next 6X in development velocity at Intuit through AIOps innovation.Data Map - to unlock the full potential of petabytes of data and decades of historical information, Intuit created a single, unified data map to accelerate productivity and break down data silos. Known internally as Intuit’s city map, this registry of all business-critical data provides technologists with a complete view of their data in one place, eliminating the need to search across various disparate systems.Intuit Data Exchange - Intuit’s data integration capability handles the consented acquisition and bi-directional exchange of data from, and to, third party providers at scale. Intuit enables our users to connect with a best-in-class network that includes 24,000 financial institutions and more than 50 crypto providers, enabling technologists to continuously improve customer experiences, including new ways to acquire data (e.g., images and video of documents) and categorize it. Over the past year, Intuit saved millions of hours of manual effort for its QuickBooks and TurboTax customers and enabled 1.7 million crypto transaction data imports in TurboTax during the most recent tax season.Intuit’s Platform Provides Speed To Benefit CustomersUsing the company’s financial technology platform architecture, Intuit is innovating products and services across its ecosystem to deliver three fundamental benefits to customers: more money in their pockets, less work, and complete confidence in every financial decision they make. Following are a few recent examples to illustrate how:QuickBooks: Intuit is delivering the industry’s best categorization system for financial transactions with 2 million personalized models refreshed daily in QuickBooks. Serving millions of customers with one-to-one mapping between the model and the customer's data, each model is tailored to a small business customer's unique situation. The model ""learns"" from user preferences for categorizing transactions.TurboTax Live: The company’s ""live"" services seamlessly blend digital services and human financial experts on a virtual expert platform. TurboTax Live filers want their taxes done fast, and right the first time by the best possible expert. With AI-driven expert matchmaking, Intuit is able to make real-time matching predictions in as little as 500 milliseconds during peak traffic. For tax year 2021, the company saw a 1-hour reduction in customer serving time for TurboTax Live Full-Service experts on Intuit’s Virtual Expert Platform, when compared to tax year 2020.TurboTax + Credit Karma Money: FY22 Credit Karma Money integrated with TurboTax to offer Refund Advance Deposits and Refunds up to 5 days early. TurboTax contributed over 50% of all new funded Credit Karma Money accounts in FY22, totaling $3 billion in refunds deposited. This involved integrating data from the recent Credit Karma acquisition across product domains.Credit Karma: Enabling customers to leverage their data seamlessly from one product to another to power data-driven personalized experiences is a top priority for Intuit, particularly when bringing new product lines into the company via acquisition, most recently with Credit Karma. The company built a data bridge to enable Intuit and its extended ecosystem to securely move data in real time, enabling more than 5 billion data elements to transfer via the data bridge in the last 6 months.For the full replay of Intuit Investor Day 2022, including CTO Marianna Tessel’s discussion about the power of the Intuit platform, visit https://investors.intuit.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2022/Intuit-Investor-Day-2022.About IntuitIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

378,c1277f31-e4f1-39ce-9910-62d0ca0c69e5,INTU,2022-10-13,7 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap to Ignore,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-value-stocks-too-cheap-121804398.html,1665317884,STORY,"['TGT', 'TMO', 'AMGN', 'DHR', 'INTU']","[With the global markets seeming poised to suffer a significant downturn, investors should prepare for this possibility by targeting cheap value stocks to buy. According to Investopedia.com, value-based investments refer to securities that trade at a price lower than the fundamentals imply. Such factors include dividends, earnings, or sales.Cheap value stocks contrast sharply with growth-centric names. While the latter enjoyed substantial momentum in 2021, at the time, the Federal Reserve accommodated such sentiments. Now that the central bank decisively pivoted to a hawkish monetary policy, growth names succumbed to massive pressure. While value plays also suffered, it’s broadly to a lower extent.Unusually, the market decides, for whatever reason, to harshly penalize certain companies over others. For contrarian investors, the red ink in the below cheap value stocks could represent a great opportunity considering the circumstances.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDHRDanaher$268.48AMGNAmgen$229.03TMOThermo Fisher$523.61HONHoneywell$171.41INTUIntuit$392.96TGTTarget$152.34VVisa$183.83Danaher (DHR)image of laptop screen displaying danaher (DHR) websiteSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comAs a Fortune 500 science and technology innovator, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) designs, manufactures and markets professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products and services. Recently, the company garnered attention for its coronavirus testing service. However, management warned earlier this year that demand for its diagnostics business would wane once Covid-19 becomes endemic.Still, an Edward Jones analyst saw circumstances differently, noting that “Covid-19 testing could become a regular or seasonal occurrence, much like flu tests are today.” The expert might have a point here. However, Wall Street doesn’t see it that way. On a year-to-date basis through the Oct. 6 session, DHR slipped nearly 12%.While I understand some hesitation for Danaher, the bearishness might be stretching things too far. According to Gurufocus.com, DHR represents a modestly undervalued investment. The company features decent strength in its balance sheet. However, it comes alive in the growth and profitability departments, with several key performance metrics at least 60% or better against sector rivals. Therefore, DHR is an all-around solid candidate for buying cheap value stocks.Story continuesAmgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn American multinational biopharmaceutical company, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) focuses on discovering, developing, manufacturing, and delivering innovative human therapeutics. To get there, Amgen leverages some of the most groundbreaking tools in the business, including advanced human genetics. Recently, the company released encouraging data regarding one of its therapeutics targeting lung cancer.Compared to other cheap-value stocks, Amgen performs comparatively well. Since the start of this year, AMGN has gained nearly 2%, which is much more than I can say about the major equity indices. Still, that seems a smooth performance, given the underlying relevancies.Indeed, Gurufocus.com labels AMGN as modestly undervalued. Amgen offers a range of solid income statement metrics relative to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.3%, which ranks better than nearly 58% of its peers. However, the biggest highlights center on the company’s profitability indicators. A notable stat is its net margin of 25%, rated better than 92% of pharma competitors.Thermo Fisher (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAn American supplier of scientific instrumentation, reagents, and consumables, along with software services, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) essentially represents the stagehand of the broader scientific industry. While it might not be the star of the show, research and development couldn’t happen without Thermo Fisher’s product empire. Therefore, TMO should qualify as a strong value play under any circumstance.However, at this juncture, it’s also one of the cheap value stocks to buy. In the price chart, TMO is down more than 16% against its January opener. Fortunately, the volatility has died off in recent sessions. Still, in the trailing month, TMO declined by 2%. Wall Street might be acting irrationally here.According to Gurufocus.com, Thermo Fisher’s business is modestly undervalued. The company features a decent balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 4.06, reflecting limited bankruptcy risk. More importantly, it commands excellent growth and profitability metrics.TMO’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 18%, better than over 63% of the competition. Additionally, its net margin of 17.4% ranks higher than nearly 80% of the medical diagnostics and research sector.Honeywell (HON)Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comA multinational industrial conglomerate and applied sciences firm, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) essentially does everything. Honeywell integrates relevancies across the broader business ecosystem from the mundane (from pre-pandemic standards), such as N95 masks, to the most innovative sectors, such as aerospace. When faced with a possible recession, it might be helpful to have a jack-of-all-trades investment.Wall Street broadcasts differing views like the other cheap value stocks. Since the start of 2022, HON has declined more than 15%. Part of the challenge associated with conglomerates is that they spread vulnerabilities across a wide surface. Therefore, investors may have lost their nerve with HON. Over time, though, former stakeholders might regret their decision.Per Gurufocus.com, HON rates as modestly undervalued. Contrarian investors will appreciate its robust profitability metrics. For instance, Honeywell features a return on equity of 28%, superior to 91% of its peers.As well it enjoys decent strengths in the balance sheet. For instance, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio pings at 2.3x, conspicuously lower than the industry median’s 3.4x.Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockOne of my favorite ideas to discuss regarding cheap value stocks, tax, and accounting software provider Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) deserves your attention. Primarily, my argument centers on the burgeoning gig economy. Several projections demonstrate that gross volume for this sector will increase noticeably in the years ahead. However, it’s essential to realize that employees and gig workers (independent contractors) have different tax profiles.You can research the differences on your own, but the short of it is that gig workers’ taxes are pound-for-pound much more complicated than employees’ W2 filings. Therefore, Intuit represents a great fundamental value on the front and back ends (accounting and tax filings). Unfortunately, Wall Street doesn’t recognize this thesis, penalizing INTU with a 35% below-parity YTD performance.Its loss is your gain. Per Gurufocus.com, Intuit commands a modestly undervalued business. This is one of the rare cheap value stocks to buy, which features overall strengths: a solid balance sheet, excellent growth metrics, and robust profitability indicators.Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comFor the riskier portion of cheap value stocks, we’ll visit big-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT). Frankly, I hesitated to include this company on this list. Generally, its rival, shall not be named, enjoys a “better” market performance, down 9% for the year. In sharp contrast, TGT hemorrhaged nearly 33% of its value during the same period.Earlier this year, famous hedge-fund manager Michael Burry aimed at retailers like Target because of the bullwhip effect. Long story short, retailers overstated how much consumer demand will exist in the post-pandemic new normal.Now, many companies have a massive excess-inventory problem. While I don’t necessarily disagree, it’s fair to point out that Target benefits from everyday acquisitions. Now, people go to Target not just for discretionary purchases but also for the necessities like food.Interestingly, Gurufocus.com labels TGT as significantly undervalued. Believe it or not, against longer-term frameworks, Target enjoys solid growth and profitability metrics relative to its industry.If you’re a dice roller, TGT could be an enticing idea among cheap value stocks to buy.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comMathematically speaking, financial services provider Visa (NYSE:V) represents one of the cheap value stocks. Should you buy it, in any case? That’s where the narrative gets tricky. With Americans facing a possible recession with near-record levels of credit card debt, you’d imagine the first thing they will do is to try to get out of said liability. From that angle, V stock seems to tempt a bearish trajectory.In the market, Visa shares fell more than 16% YTD, so understandably, investors have concerns. On the other hand, financial credit allows some households to stretch their budgets to make ends meet. It’s a cynical view, sure, but it happens. And that should theoretically bolster Visa’s business.Now onto the math; Gurufocus.com considers V stock as significantly undervalued. Buying Visa stock is tempting because it just seems too cheap relative to the fundamentals. It features a favorable cash-to-debt ratio compared to industry norms.

(NYSE:LYB) earlier this year lose an additional US$28k as the stock sinks to US$77.72,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-purchased-lyondellbasell-industries-n-144000732.html,1665585600,STORY,['LYB'],"[The recent price decline of 4.1% in LyondellBasell Industries N.V.'s (NYSE:LYB) stock may have disappointed insiders who bought US$463k worth of shares at an average price of US$82.80 in the past 12 months. Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$435k which is not ideal.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries LyondellBasell Industries Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Non-Executive Director Robin William Buchanan made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$463k worth of shares at a price of US$110 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$77.72). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Robin William Buchanan was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeLyondellBasell Industries is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that LyondellBasell Industries insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$55m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About LyondellBasell Industries Insiders?The fact that there have been no LyondellBasell Industries insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders own shares in LyondellBasell Industries and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries (1 is concerning) you should be aware of.Of course LyondellBasell Industries may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

383,d0acfd08-fba2-3a1e-9209-34a0456230ff,GE,2022-10-13,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Electric Company (GE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-electric-130001625.html,1665579601,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned -9.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -11.7% change. The Zacks Diversified Operations industry, to which GE belongs, has lost 11.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share, indicating a change of -14% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.71 points to a change of +27.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.43 indicates a change of +63.5% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of GE, the consensus sales estimate of $19.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The $75.89 billion and $81.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $18.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.59%. The EPS surprise was +105.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. With the Fed raising rates five times this year itself, the favorable environment is a boon for long-tail P&amp;C insurers. Notably, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.P&amp;C insurers’ profitability is likely to be weighed down by catastrophic events.

Production from the refinery is expected to reach 2,500 tons by the end of this year, with a target to rapidly expand production to 20,000 tons by 2023.In July, Eni started producing the first vegetable oil from its Makueni agri-hub for bio-refineries in Kenya. The agri-hub processes castor, croton and cottonseeds to extract vegetable oil for biofuel production.Biofuels have biodegradable substances like vegetable oils mixed with fuels such as diesel to reduce pollution. Biofuel production is part of the global transition to cleaner energy amid the urgency to reduce emissions that have significantly polluted the environment. Hence, biorefining is a crucial component in the company’s path to net-zero emissions by 2050.Eni also began exporting the Used Cooking Oil (“UCO”) obtained from hotel chains, restaurants and bars in Nairobi through an ongoing project. The project supports the recycling culture, promoting awareness of the environment and health benefits, and generating income from waste.Eni intends to cover 35% of its biorefineries’ supply by 2025 due to the vertical integration of the agri-feedstock, and waste and residue chain. This will allow the company to obtain volumes of vegetable oil amid the challenging circumstances based on prices, rising energy demand and availability of sustainable oils.Eni has been contributing to Kenya’s growth since 2013 with offshore exploration activities in the Lamu Basin. The latest shipment demonstrates the testing phase of Kenya’s bid to produce aviation fuel and hydrogenated vegetable oil diesel, and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.Price PerformanceShares of Eni have underperformed the industry in the past six months.

389,a715c880-4e3d-334a-84a2-6ad73ac95535,VLO,2022-10-13,Jim Cramer Says Stocks Will Climb Once Fed Signals Shift; Here Are 2 Names to Watch,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-stocks-climb-133705623.html,1665581825,STORY,"['VLO', 'OXY']","[Inflation is high, the Fed is aggressively hiking interest rates, and the markets keep testing their lows for the year. The rest of this week will see several key monthly reports, including the consumer price index, or the inflation report, on Thursday. Currently, inflation is up 8.3% since last year, and economists are expecting that number to decline to 8.1%.Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, is finding a silver lining in the current situation, telling investors, “I always say there’s no give without a get. Right now, the give is that you get your portfolio all going down — the Fed’s bringing the pain. The get is that you’ll eventually be rewarded with lower inflation followed by lower rates. We’re very much in the first phase, though, the give phase.”But when the Fed does switch away from hiking rates, the ‘get’ may be substantial – and Cramer recommends picking up some relevant stocks now, while markets generally are down, in preparation for a later true rally.Cramer has made some specific calls on this end, and we’ve used the TipRanks databank to pull up the details on two of them; here they are, presented along with commentary from the Wall Street analysts.Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)The first ‘Cramer pick’ we’ll look at is Valero Energy, a major producer and distributor of refined fuels. Valero works in the North American, Caribbean, and UK markets, and operates 15 refiners in the US, Canada, and the UK, along with a 50 megawatt wind farm and 11 ethanol biofuel plants. The company is the second largest producer of both corn ethanol and renewable diesel fuels on the global markets.Valero ran net earnings losses through 2020, but in 2Q21 the company turned to profitability – and has seen earnings and revenues both rise since then. In the last reported quarter, 2Q22, both the top and bottom lines saw major jumps. Revenues hit $51.6 billion, up 86% from the year-ago quarter, and diluted EPS rose to $11.36, from just 63 cents one year prior. The company had a total adjusted net quarterly income attributable to shareholders of $4.6 billion.Story continuesThe biggest support for Valero’s strong 2Q22 performance came from the company’s refining segment, which saw revenues increase from just $349 million in 2Q21 to $6.2 billion in 2Q22. Per the end of the second quarter, Valero reported total debt of $10.9 billion and cash on hand of $5.4 billion, compared to $13 billion of debt and $2.3 billion of cash one year earlier.Valero has maintained its dividend in recent years, and the current payment, 98 cents per common share quarterly, or $3.92 annualized, yields a 3.5%.Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, analyst Connor Lynagh sees Valero with a clear path to maintain profits, writing: “On the most important debate right now — demand destruction — VLO's commentary was upbeat, suggesting limited evidence that product demand is softening in response to high prices. VLO seems well-positioned to navigate continued market choppiness and capitalize on the opportunities potentially opened by Europe's desire to wean itself off Russian refined products…”""We continue to like shares here, but acknowledge that leading edge economic data points and evidence of the magnitude and duration of a potential recession will be the key driver of share price performance. For now, shareholders can simply count on VLO management to generate and return substantial sums of cash,"" the analyst summed up.To this end, Lynagh rates VLO an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $140 price target shows his confidence in a one-year upside potential of ~29%. (To watch Lynagh’s track record, click here)So, that’s Morgan Stanley's view, what does the rest of the Street make of Valero's prospects? All are on board, as it happens. The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a unanimous 11 Buys. Moreover, the $144.27 average target, suggests shares have room for ~33% growth in the year ahead. (See VLO stock forecast on TipRanks)Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY)For the second stock, we’ll stick with the energy industry and look at Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest hydrocarbon exploration and production firms in the business. Occidental has hydrocarbon production ops in the US, North Africa, and the Middle East, and its activities include midstream transport and power generation. In addition to petroleum and petroleum products, Occidental also works in industrial chemicals, producing chlor-alkalis, vinyls, and chlorinated organic chemicals. And on a third important track, the company has a Low Carbon Venture, aimed at transforming the use of CO2 emissions to a sustainable model.Occidental’s top line revenues in the last reported quarter, 2Q22, hit $10.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. This solid result led to further sound financials in the drill downs. Cash from operations was listed at $5.3 billion, and free cash flow came in at $4.2 billion. The company repaid some 19% of its total debt in quarter, and was still able to repurchase 18 million shares for $1.1 billion (as of August 1, 2022). The company increases its shareholder return with a modest 13-cent common share dividend, paid out quarterly.Shares in OXY have dramatically outperformed the overall markets this year. OXY is up 107%, compared to the 25% drop in the S&amp;P 500 and the 20% drop in the Dow Jones. Yet, according to Cramer, OXY ""could have some upside here."" The company’s position as a producer of an essential product, and its willingness to monetize the more socially acceptable ‘low carbon’ track, have undergirded its share strength.Writing from Truist, 5-star analyst Neal Dingmann believes that Occidental can continue to both maintain profits and pay down debt, improving its overall position and its leverage.“Occidental continues to maximize its diversified portfolio resulting in ~$4B of quarterly FCF, that the company has prudently used to materially pay down debt to $22B recently from nearly $36B just a year ago. The much improved leverage has allowed OXY to increase shareholder returns (base dividend and buybacks)… We forecast the company to continue with their ~20 rig US onshore program that along with the GoM and international operations should result in mid-single digit growth, by our estimates,” Dingmann opined.Looking ahead from this bullish stance, Dingmann rates OXY shares a Buy, while his $105 price target implies a potential upside of ~64% for the year ahead. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here)Overall, OXY gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, with 8 Buys, 6 Holds, and a single Sell set in the three months. The stock is selling for $63.74, and the average price target, now at $78.14, implies a one-year upside potential of ~22%.

This divestiture is in line with the company’s objective of concentrating on areas of energy expansion that are more complementary to SU’s core business, such as hydrogen and renewable fuels, along with progressing toward net zero by 2050.The assets being divested by Suncor comprise the new 202-megawatt Forty Mile wind project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is anticipated to be operational by 2022 end.

Moreover, the purchase price is subject to typical closing adjustments.Kris Smith, Suncor’s interim president and chief executive officer, mentioned that the sale of these assets streamlines SU’s portfolio, helping the company focus its efforts on the core business. “Our ESG efforts will continue to advance in other areas that are complementary to our core business such as replacing coke-fired boilers at Base Plant with lower emission cogeneration units, investing in hydrogen and low-carbon fuels and accelerating commercial scale deployment of carbon capture technology,” he added.Founded in 1917, Alberta-based Suncor Energy, Inc. is Canada's premier integrated energy company. The company's operations include oil sands development and upgrading, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining and product marketing.SU is one of the largest owners of oil sands worldwide.

Workers will get more funds to pursue coursework, and employees in some states will be able to access new health plan benefits, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the program hasn’t been announced publicly.It’s part of a broader effort to reward workers at the Cupertino, California-based company, which has had to navigate inflationary pressure, a tight labor market and changing demands of workers during the pandemic. But the company was quick to inform the employees at its unionized retail location -- a store in the Baltimore suburb of Towson, Maryland -- that they wouldn’t get the new perks.The reason given was that the Towson store needs to negotiate benefits with Apple via the collective bargaining arrangement that comes with a union. The approach isn’t unique to Apple. Excluding unionized stores from new benefits has also been a flashpoint in the labor dispute at Starbucks Corp., where about 250 cafes have voted to unionize over the past year. Starbucks rolled out a series of new perks at nonunion stores, including raises and student-debt coaching, while saying that it can’t legally provide them unilaterally to sites with union activity.Apple’s move could dissuade employees in other cities from unionizing their stores, but it also could further upset workers. The company declined to comment.Story continuesEmployees at an Apple store in Oklahoma City are due to vote this week whether to join the Communications Workers of America, and labor groups are looking to mobilize workers at more of the company’s US stores in the coming months. The iPhone maker also has contended with some employee pushback in its office staff, which was ordered back to in-person work in recent months.The new benefits include:Apple prepaying some tuition for outside education. The company has long reimbursed employees for a portion of education costs, but the iPhone maker will now pay the amount in advance. This will start at a small amount of colleges, though the list is expected to expand over time.A program with Coursera Inc. beginning on Jan. 1 that gives Apple employees a free membership. Coursera is an online-course provider that normally charges $399 per year for its premium subscription.In certain states, including Connecticut, New York, Georgia, Washington and New Jersey, employees will get access to a new health care plan that waives co-pays for some Apple-approved doctors within the UnitedHealth Group Inc. network.Apple’s behavior could be deemed by the National Labor Relations Board to violate federal law, which forbids anti-union threats or discrimination, labor experts said. The timing of the new benefits could be particularly significant, since it comes on the eve of the Oklahoma City election.“It’s hard to see how they could come up with a legitimate reason for the timing other than to influence the outcome of the election,” former union attorney and NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman said in an email.Apple has expanded other benefits for workers over the past year. The company previously upped vacation and sick days, and it has long-offered health care and product discounts.The store in Maryland, which is represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, is preparing to begin formal negotiations with Apple. Its labor group in recent days supplied employees with guides to negotiate with Apple and hold conversations with managers.According to an internal survey provided with the guide that was obtained by Bloomberg News, the No. 1 bargaining priority at that location is general wage increases, followed by cost-of-living adjustments, improved work-life balance, better communication and more staffing.The union said Wednesday that it remained committed to negotiations at the Maryland store.“Our goal is still the same,” the IAM union said in a statement. “We are urging Apple to negotiate in good faith so we can reach an agreement over the next few weeks.”Apple’s union-related moves have been under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks, with the NLRB and CWA accusing the iPhone maker of discriminating against pro-union employees.In the Starbucks case, the union said it waived the right to negotiate over receiving perks that were already being provided to other stores -- meaning employees should just get them automatically. Workers United, the group attempting to organize Starbucks cafes, described the denial of benefits as a union-busting tactic.While it is true that the law restricts companies from making unilateral changes at unionized shops, nothing prohibits management from offering to give union workers the same new perks that other staff are getting, said Harvard Law School professor Benjamin Sachs.That’s true even if there isn’t yet an overall collective bargaining agreement yet, he said. “They can’t impose the increases, but they can offer them to the union,” Sachs said.“If you give benefit increases to nonunion workers and withhold them from union workers, you’re sending a message of favoritism and discrimination,” he said. “You’re trying to discourage workers from forming unions.”(Updates with commentary from labor experts starting in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketHow Gamers Beat NFTsExxon’s Exodus: Employees Have Finally Had Enough of Its Toxic CultureThis Is What the Gas Station of the Future Will Look Like©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Doximity (DOCS) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.18 a share 27 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 8, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.18 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.16 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Doximity has an Earnings ESP of 14.29%.DOCS is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well.UnitedHealth Group, which is readying to report earnings on October 14, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.47 a share, and UNH is two days out from its next earnings report.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.35% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, DOCS and UNH could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.48bUS$2.96bUS$3.70bUS$4.19bUS$4.60bUS$4.90bUS$5.16bUS$5.38bUS$5.57bUS$5.74bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.59%Est @ 5.21%Est @ 4.24%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.3kUS$2.6kUS$3.0kUS$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$122bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$122b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$63bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$94b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$215, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Estée Lauder Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $20.56 billion, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.83% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P&amp;G?For P&amp;G, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P&amp;G will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P&amp;G would post earnings of $1.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of -1.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P&amp;G doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the REIT sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Dividend Stocks. Over the years, the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector in the US expanded into a wide range of diverse assets. In 2021, the sector performed well after recovering from the ills of the pandemic a year before. Morgan Stanley mentioned in a report that global listed real estate markets returned 27.2% in 2021, citing data from FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index. In addition to this, the REIT sector also contributes significantly to the national GDP. According to a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the sector generates nearly $197 billion in labor income through 3 million jobs. Moreover, the REITs in the US own real estate assets worth over $3.5 trillion.The sector is increasingly becoming popular among investors as it offers relatively high dividend yields, which is rewarding in times of financial instability. From 2015 to 2020, the average dividend yield of the Dow Jones US Select REIT Index was 3.7%, compared with a 2% average yield of the S&amp;P 500, as reported by S&amp;P Global. Besides offering high yields, these companies earn stable streams of income from long-tenant leases and also distribute 90% of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders. According to a report by Nareit, distributed dividends and interest payments supported $26.1 billion in labor income during the second quarter of 2022. The report also mentioned that the sector distributed dividends worth over $92.3 billion in 2021.Over the years, the returns of the REIT sector are also worth noticing as it outperformed its peers. As reported by CBRE Investment Management, US REITs delivered an average annual return of 10.8% in the last 20 years ending November 2021. In comparison, other global equities returned 6.8% during the same period. This year, dividend stocks like PepsiCo, Inc.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 19.7% loss over the past four weeks.This increased optimism stems from the favorable fundamentals of the industrial real estate market and the company’s capacity to leverage growth potential.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $1.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.9%.

Longer-term pockets of recovery remain — corporate travel (happening, yet eternally debated) and easing global travel restrictions,"" Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth stated in a new note to clients.""With continued network restoration and lower assumed fuel [costs] next year, the case for traffic growth in ’23 (vs. ’22) is obvious. Over time, capacity normalization should drive unit cost (and unit revenue) normalization,"" he added.The airline industry is already seeing signs of brighter skies after the turbulent COVID-19 period.United Airlines recently lifted its third quarter revenue guidance to 12% growth from 11%. Operating margins are seen at about 10.5%, above a prior estimate for 10%.Rival American Airlines said demand was strong in September — it now sees third quarter sales rising 13% compared to prior guidance for 10% to 12%.Airlines never got an invitation to the lockdown rager, yet they get an equal dose of hangover now that the punch bowl has been taken awayDuane Pfennigwerth, EvercoreThe above-plan guidance comes despite the ongoing overall economic slowdown.Delta reports earnings Thursday morning and may provide more upbeat commentary to fuel a renewed bull case on the airline sector.But, to be sure, there continues to be haters on airline stocks.

Shares up just around 1 and 1/2%. The airliner announcing today that it will be adding to its transatlantic travel slate next summer. The news comes as United reports demand up 20% from 2019 during the peak portion of this summer.Joining us now for more on this and the state of the industry, we want to bring in Helane Becker, Cowen senior research analyst. Helane, it's great to see you. So we had the news from United. The news yesterday was American lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right. Demand, especially for international, is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international, and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer.We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season. And we said we thought American, Delta, United had the best opportunity for positive surprise. Because we've gone from the first, say, four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60%, 50% to 60% from 2019 levels. And now we're down closer to 15%.So you've seen that big increase. As markets have opened up, people have shifted and started flying further, especially transatlantic. Not so much trans-pacific, but transatlantic. And business, we've gone from being down about 40% or 50% earlier in the year to being down 25% earlier in the year.So I think those two elements-- and we've still seen strong domestic leisure. But instead of being up 30%, 35%, it's up closer to 10%, 15%. So you've seen that mix shift, which has huge positive implications for revenue. And I think Delta reports tomorrow first. You just mentioned that. And I think you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter or-- the rest of the current quarter, yeah. Fourth quarter.Story continues- And Helane, obviously the industry is still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines?HELANE BECKER: I'm sorry. I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well?- As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages, as we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out, how is this affecting some of the most profitable routes?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. So we're having these issues with, to your point, with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor. It's air traffic control. It's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last, but I was at an airport yesterday, two airports yesterday and the day before. And stores are closed. They haven't reopened. They can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that.And so that's going to inform growth for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that-- you didn't specifically ask about this, but the OEMs are behind on deliveries. So the airlines don't have the-- and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go, and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft.United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot-- they didn't retire any, as a matter of fact, of their wide-body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated an outperform.And the others retired their aircraft. And in part, they were older, so it made sense to retire them. But they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries. They're having issues getting aircraft to be able to grow going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too.- Yeah. Helane, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to rein in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. So the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every-- the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight attendant contract. I would love to hear them talk about-- they probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls.But I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great, both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice if the pilots, the flight attendants, knew what they were going to be earning. And I think that would be good to get that resolved.We also-- as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that.I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has, that Americans mostly have anyway, is a cashback card. And then that's usually followed by a gas card.But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card. And your spend is probably high. And you-- but it takes a while to earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airlines like having that dollar today, because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet. And it definitely helps.But if there's this shift in mix to more leisure-oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that.Demand for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fares are getting a little out of control. And so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving. Or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. And it's just gotten really aggressive.Especially given how far fares have come in the last, say, 18 months. Because obviously, in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting. And in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fares pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs and in part to discourage some demand.But yeah. Flights are full. They're 90%-- well, they're more. They're almost always going out with very few available seats.- Well, certainly airlines, and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helane Becker for joining us this afternoon. Thank you.]"

The uptick followed management’s decision to increase its revenue forecast for third-quarter 2022. AAL will announce third-quarter results on Oct 20.Air-travel demand recovered from the pandemic-induced lows. We expect upbeat air-travel demand, following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, to have aided American Airlines’ top-line performance in the September quarter. Observance of the Labor Day holiday period during the third quarter is likely to have boosted the air traffic further. Evidently, the decision to hike the revenue guidance comes as no surprise.Revised GuidanceAmerican Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects total revenues to rise approximately 13% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier expectation: increase 10-12%). Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a measure of unit revenue) is now anticipated to be 25% higher than the third-quarter 2019 reading (earlier estimate was a 20-24% rise).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Driven by upbeat demand, the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, is anticipated to be roughly 4.5% compared with the 2-4% band expected earlier. The third-quarter operating margin (excluding net special items) is expected to be roughly 7%. The average fuel cost per gallon forecast is maintained in the $3.73-$3.78 range. However, the guidance for fuel gallons consumed is decreased to 1,031 million from 1,040 million.American Airlines now expects third-quarter 2022 capacity to decline 9.6% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was a decline in the 8-10% range). Due to low capacity, cost per available seat miles or CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is high and expected to increase roughly 14% in third-quarter 2022 from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance was a 12-14% increase).Story continuesUpbeat Passenger Revenues Likely to Aid Airlines’ Q3 ResultsDelta Air Lines DAL will kick-start the third-quarter 2022 earnings season for airlines on Oct 13. Like AAL, we expect DAL’s results to reflect upbeat passenger revenues owing to buoyant passenger volumes.DAL expects September-quarter revenues to increase in the 1-5% band from the third-quarter 2019 actuals. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, in third-quarter 2022is expected to increase 22% from the third-quarter 2019 actuals.Like AAL, United Airlines UAL lifted its revenue guidance for third-quarter 2022. UAL is scheduled to announce results on Oct 18. Like AAL and DAL, we also expect UAL’s results to reflect upbeat passenger revenues owing to buoyant passenger volumes.UAL now expects operating revenues to grow 12% from the September-quarter level of 2019 (previous guidance was 11%). United Airlines expects TRASM to increase around 25% in the third quarter of 2022 from the third-quarter 2019 actuals (previous view: up in 24-26% band). Adjusted operating margin is expected to be 10.5% in the September quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

According to Pew Research, about 50% of U.S. adults 55 and older are out of the labor force due to retirement, in part because of the pandemic.1 Additionally, gig and contract work is on the rise. The most recent data shows a 33% increase in 1099-K form (indicating revenue collected outside of an employer/employee relationship) filing from 2020 to 2021.2 What's more, 16% of Americans say they've earned money from an online gig platform.3""Whether entering retirement or pursuing solopreneur, gig or contract work, there is a growing number of Americans earning a living outside of the traditional worksite; but what hasn't changed is their need for the type of financial security that Aflac products can help provide,"" said Aflac Senior Vice President of Distribution Expansion and Consumer Markets Jeramy Tipton. ""Because benefits are traditionally obtained through the employer, these trends leave a gap in accessibility to insurance coverage for many Americans, a gap that Aflac is helping close by introducing popular products with these individuals in mind.""The new Aflac Dental, Vision and Hearing product includes three plan tiers so individuals can select the coverage that best meets their needs. For basic dental care and major dental services, out-of-pocket costs paid by the policyholder decrease over time, while the annual maximum benefit paid by Aflac can increase. Additionally, all plans offer preventive service benefits with no out-of-pocket costs.Story continues""Americans outside of the traditional workforce are carrying the responsibility for many aspects of their financial security, which can leave them vulnerable if they do not properly insure themselves and their families,"" said Tipton. ""This new Aflac Dental, Vision and Hearing product can help this growing segment of the U.S. workforce to better manage their preventive and ongoing health care needs. In addition, the product is a natural complement to Aflac's senior market product portfolio that includes Aflac Medicare Supplement and Aflac Final Expense insurance.""Highlights of Aflac's bundled Dental, Vision and Hearing insurance:  All plans offer preventive dental service benefits with no out-of-pocket costs.For basic dental care and major dental services, the deductible and percent of costs paid by the policyholder can decrease over time, while the annual maximum benefits paid by Aflac can increase.Dental plan benefits are the same for in- and out-of-network treatment, giving policyholders flexibility in choosing a provider while enabling lower out-of-pockets costs when using a participating network provider.By electing to add Vision and Hearing to a Dental plan, policyholders will receive coverage for annual vision and hearing exams, plus an allowance for corrective lenses and hearing aids.For more information visit www.aflac.com/dental.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATED Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) is a Fortune 500 company helping provide protection to more than 50 million people through its subsidiaries in Japan and the U.S., paying cash fast when policyholders get sick or injured.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this insurer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 8.04%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Aflac came out with earnings of $1.46 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share, representing a surprise of 13.18%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.42 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.90%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Aflac lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aflac currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.17%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 31, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Since opening Monday, Cedar Hill Urgent Care is now operating 12 hours a day, which means fewer residents of wards 7 and 8 will need to visit emergency rooms — already struggling with pandemic-era staffing and financial challenges — for much of their care, said Wayne Turnage, D.C.’s deputy mayor for health and human services and director of the Department of Health Care Finance.

This acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2023 after receiving approval from all regulatory authorities. This deal will add 15,000 wastewater customers to Pennsylvania American Water’s existing customer base of 2.4 million.The aging of crucial water and wastewater infrastructure is concerning for the water industry of the United States. After completing the acquisition, Pennsylvania American Water plans to invest nearly $75 million to improve the overall wastewater infrastructure of the acquired assets.The acquisition of wastewater assets is an extension of American Water Works’ high-quality services. Pennsylvania American Water has been providing water service to nearly 19,500 customers in the region.Fragmented Industry Needs ConsolidationAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, at present, more than 51,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Due to a large number of small operators in the industry and lack of adequate funds, at times, essential upgrade and repair of infrastructure get delayed.Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the loss of water utility operators. Aging and lack of timely maintenance are major contributors to pipeline breaks.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments for the upgrade of infrastructure and the continuation of high-quality services for customers. American Water Works continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Story continuesUtilities Continue to ConsolidateAmerican Water Works is expanding its customer base through organic initiatives and acquisitions. It continues to focus on the acquisition of utilities that provide services to 5,000-50,000 customers. Through nine acquisitions, the company added 51,000 customers to its existing customer base.

They also raised their full year forecast. Taking a look at some of these numbers, organic revenue up 16% growth there. The growth was also broad-based. North America and also global markets each delivering that 16% growth. Snacks were up 20%. Beverages were up 12%.We had the CFO, Hugh Johnston, on Yahoo Finance earlier today. And he was basically saying that Pepsi has historically done well, even into a recession. So Rachelle, maybe that explains the strong numbers here. I think the question, though, for Wall Street as we do see the strong report come out of Pepsi, Pepsi leading the way for this current quarter, whether or not this is going to be a trend. Maybe earnings aren't going to be as weak as we had initially expected, or rather, if Pepsi will simply be an outlier here.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's interesting. Obviously, we're still very early in the earnings season, but perhaps this speaks to the consumer that they're not pulling away from brand loyalty. They are sticking with some of these brands. Obviously, Pepsi also owns Doritos, Gatorade, and a number of other brands as well. And consumers clearly still sticking with that loyalty and still willing to spend a premium for some of these brand names versus, say, some of these store brands.We know that during-- as recession-- as inflation has peaked, people have turned to some of these grocery store brands. But as we're seeing, consumer staples still going strong at the moment, as we're looking at some of the ones on the screen here, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Tysons, Campbell, and Kellogg enjoying some gains today, showing that people aren't pulling back, at least, on some of these things, despite high inflation, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and Seana asked which of those things will happen. I'm just going to go with yes, because overall, I think Pepsi is going to continue to grow. Snacks and beverages will continue to be recession proof because they've talked about raising their prices. It has not impacted one bit the demand.Story continuesIn fact, their CEO says our category seems to be growing faster than food. Food is growing faster than non-food. I don't think that's going to change in spite of all the ups and downs potentially economically around the world. I don't think overall, they're going to be the rule of what we see in the quarter, with the exception of booze, my friends.Tilray, we really focused on their earnings in terms of being a Canadian cannabis company. They saw their cannabis revenue down 9% in the quarter. Guess what booze was? Up 33% in the quarter. Cannabis down 9%, booze up 33%. We saw that with Constellation Brands as well that said they're recession resistant. And the demand has not dropped off. So, again, yes, I guess would be my overall--SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I also think it's interesting, just the commentary that we've gotten out from Wall Street so far. Wedbush was out saying that this is a positive readthrough on expectations for the broader sector, for the broader beverage sectors. That points to what you were saying just in terms of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverage companies here. And also, Pepsi was raised to a strong buy at CFRA, a 12% upside there after the earnings beat on both the top and bottom line. So the Street's encouraged. I hope this is a trend, but we'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: We love our snacks.]"

Its shares jumped 4%.The snack and beverage giant’s ability to pass on higher costs to consumers has caught the eye of investors looking to weather the current market volatility amid economic uncertainty and rising interest rates.“If you want to weather this volatility, until we answer the question of a shallow recession or not, Pepsi is the type of business that we would be looking at because it does have positive cash flow, good earnings structures going forward, and they've invested in their own future growth,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks said ahead of Pepsi’s quarterly results in a recent interview with Investing.com.Story continuesTechnology remained under pressure as gains in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were offset by a drag from weakness in chip stocks.In other news, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 8% after announcing that it would team up with Merck&amp;Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) to develop and sell a cancer drug.Related ArticlesStock Market Today: Dow Ends Lower as Fed Fears Overshadow Pop in PepsiTodayâs Important Price Target ChangesItaly's MPS nears finish line on securing banks' support for stock sale]"

Take a look at the stock. They're up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full year organic revenue to increase 12%.

You know, throw a little Pepsi Max--AKIKO FUJITA: Gotta keep it a little casual.BRIAN SOZZI: Put some vodka and ice, and you're good to go.AKIKO FUJITA: Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient, even in the face of cost rises.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talked to PepsiCo's CFO Hugh Johnston. He said, hey, Yahoo Finance team, we're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, I guess we don't have that.BRIAN SOZZI: We don't have that, but still, Johnston came out, really, I think he struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call. But ultimately, he said that's not where they're going to go yet, too.We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch what they're calling their new Fast Twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine, in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That should be good.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: 200 milligrams of caffeine.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, right up my alley.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I was going to say--BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, I am so excited, Akiko. I can't wait.AKIKO FUJITA: --you're going to have more than one of those, right, in the morning.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, absolutely.AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, when you talk about those cost increases, I mean, how much of it is it to offset-- I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks. But at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, they have-- I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think, an earnings beat nobody on the Street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here. For a Pepsi on an earnings day, that's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform. This quarter has positively surprised a lot of folks on the Street. Over the next coming days, I would not be too surprised to see upgrades on PepsiCo stock, upgrades in price targets, upgrades in earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power.And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola, to see if they can report more of the same. First instinct is, yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than PepsiCo. But still, Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter now.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, currency exposure one we're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sozzi, thanks so much.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks.]"

The app also shows when a workspace is likely to be pretty empty to help managers make decisions about electricity, heating and cooling that can save money. For example, as Europe looks to a winter of fuel and electricity shortages, companies are seeking tools like this, Microsoft vice president Jared Spataro said in an interview.The software maker also is introducing a new premium version of the Teams chat and conferencing app that will generate summaries of meetings with chapters and personalized highlights, which will let more workers skip meetings they don’t really need to attend and catch up later, he said. Too many people go to meetings because of a “fear of missing out” rather than the need to be there, he said.“We see a lot of FOMO in meetings — people go because they want to either be seen or there really is a fear of missing out,” he said. “We're going to promote what we call JOMO — the joy of missing out, like please don't attend that meeting and let intelligent recap do the work for you.”Teams Premium will be widely available beginning in February at $10 per user per month, Microsoft said.The company will also offer OpenAI’s Dall-E, which generates images from text prompts, to select customers of Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI cloud service. Azure OpenAI lets Microsoft cloud customers make use of some of the artificial intelligence products OpenAI has developed. Customers such as Mattel are now using Dall-E through Azure cloud to generate images of toy cars they might want to design, Microsoft said. The company will also add the image creation tool to one of its consumer Design products and its Bing search image creation tool.Story continuesThe new workplace app and update to Teams were among the products and services Microsoft introduced Wednesday at its annual Ignite conference.
