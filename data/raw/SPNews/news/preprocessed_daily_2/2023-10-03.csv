Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with SCHW. Click here to check it out. SCHW 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SCHWAs of 2023-10-02, Charles Schwab Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $93.72. It's currently trading at a price of $53.55. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 42.86%. The company is significantly undervalued.Unlocking Intrinsic Value: A Deep Dive into Charles Schwab CorpThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Charles Schwab Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.43GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.67%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 18.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=48.76Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=44.96Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=93.72Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $65.25. This valuation indicates that the Charles Schwab Corp is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 17.93%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.67bUS$5.29bUS$6.87bUS$10.9bUS$13.2bUS$15.2bUS$17.0bUS$18.4bUS$19.7bUS$20.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 21.12%Est @ 15.43%Est @ 11.44%Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.70%Est @ 5.34% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$4.3kUS$4.5kUS$5.3kUS$7.8kUS$8.7kUS$9.2kUS$9.4kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$8.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$77bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.2%) = US$318bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$318b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$137bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$213b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$160, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.332. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Texas InstrumentsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge Funds.The augmented reality market has promising growth prospects given the tech industry’s massive shift towards immersive reality, metaverse, Internet of Things and AI. A Mordor Intelligence report estimates that the overall size of the augmented reality market was expected to grow from $29.84 billion in 2023 to $174.47 billion by 2028. This would be a CAGR of 42.36%.While AI takes all the media hype, major companies are continuously launching new AR/VR products that are changing the way we interact with the physical world. For example, earlier this year, Google launched Geospatial Creator, a set of tools powered by ARCore and Google Maps Platform. The tools will allow developers to build and “scale AR immersive experiences easily and accurately using various technologies, such as Photorealistic 3D Tiles, Rooftop anchors, Streetscape Geometry, and Scene Semantics.”Apple earlier this year upped the ante in the AR/VR race by revealing its Vision Pro headset, which would have a hefty price tag of $3,499. The mixed-reality headset is scheduled for release in early 2024.Many other companies are jumping in the race to compete with bigger companies. The company behind Pokemon Go, Ninantic, is making its own “visual positioning system” (VPS) to compete with Google.In this backdrop it'd be interesting to see which augmented reality stocks smart money investors are piling into. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds and picked 16 augmented reality stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Top Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge FundsPhoto by David Grandmougin on UnsplashTop 16 Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge Funds16. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) sells wearable display technology and augmented reality products. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) is down about 40% over the past one year. In August Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) posted strong Q2 results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at -$0.14 beating estimates by $0.03. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 56.3% year over year to $4.69 million, beating estimates by $0.42 million.Story continuesOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 7 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI). The most significant stakeholder of Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) was ARK Investment Management of Catherine D. Wood which owns a $33 million stake in the company.15. Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14California-based Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) makes haptic technology that is used in AR and VR devices. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR). The biggest stakeholder of Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) during this period was Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates which owns a $7.4 million stake in the company.Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) is also a dividend-paying stock. Earlier in September Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) declared a dividend of $0.03 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The dividend is payable on October 27 for shareholders of record as of October 16.14. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Snap is one of the most notable AR companies in the world. The company offers AR lenses and spectacles, along with several filters and in-app AR features. Earlier this year Snap introduced ray tracing technology to its AR Lens Studio for developers. The company said this technology will allow realistic renderings of light and shine on AR artifacts.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“SNAP shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth, while announcing a broadbased cost restructuring.Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”13. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Gaming company Unity software stands to benefit from the AR revolution as more and more companies hire AR and VR experts to develop immersive reality games.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 30 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company.12. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) shares have gained about 25% over the past one year. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) sells OLED Micro-display products that are used in immersive products like VR and AR headsets and glasses. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) also sells controllers for haptic feedback and immersive experiences for games, virtual reality and other applications.A total of 31 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) as of the end of the second quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) was Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors which owns a $138 million stake in the company.Aristotle Capital made the following comment about Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”11. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Online gaming platform Roblox allows gamers and developers build virtual worlds. The company could gain on the back of the upcoming VR revolution. The stock is currently in the spotlight after SoMA Partners’ Gil Simon said in an interview with CNBC that Roblox stock could double.""We think the next few years is a nice trajectory for them to increase those margins by as much as 300 basis points a year. We think next year will be an up year, this year will be the trough and we are looking out to 2025 and 2026 and we think those margins could be back into the 20s,” Simon said.Artisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated new GardenSM positions in Keysight, Roblox and Liberty Media Corp–Liberty Formula One during the quarter. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is an online platform that allows users to play games created by other users and to create their own games using the Roblox Studio, a robust suite of development and coding tools. The company’s model is similar to a social network in that user-generated content scales with user growth on the platform and benefits from viral adoption. While the graphics, user interface and general gameplay currently appeal more to younger people, Roblox is pursuing a strategy of investing heavily to accelerate its technological capabilities so that it can provide experiences that appeal to an older demographic. We believe the valuation is justifiable given the stickiness of the core platform (the average user spends 2.4 hours per day on Roblox), its attractive business model and a potential bull case where Roblox becomes a leading place to create and consume social 3D experiences for the general population.Roblox is another (there are more) example of a company that is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI advancements. As discussed earlier, Roblox is a social gaming platform that relies on user-generated content. This content is enabled by the platform’s robustyet-simple tools for relatively novice developers. AI has the potential to turbocharge this tool set—with AI-assisted code building and generative artwork creation. Over time, this should enable a deeper pool of user-generated content that attracts an expanding set of game players.”10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that would gain both directly and indirectly from the AR market. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) sells technologies that are used in augmented reality systems. For example, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)’ TI DLP® Pico technology enables small, high-performance, low power AR display modules.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 56 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN). The most significant stakeholder of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) was David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management which owns a $777 million stake in the company.9. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Gaming company Take Two is expected to gain from the rise of AR games. The company is expected to roll out next-gen games in the coming months and weeks that will have immersive reality features.Diamond Hill All Cap Select Strategy made the following comment about Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Video game developer Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) has faced weakness in the mobile gaming market, in addition to game-launching delays. The company reported underwhelming quarterly results in Q4 and lowered its full-year guidance. After reexamining our long-term thesis, we decided to exit our position in favor of more attractive opportunities.”8. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Technologies, platforms and products made by QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) play a key role in enabling companies in developing next-generation AR systems. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s strengths in the 5G domain will also help it engage in the immersive, 5G-powered world of tomorrow. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon® augmented reality technology can power smart glasses and many other AR devices. Recently, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Baidu to cooperate on extended reality, or XR, technology and jointly create a new platform for metaverse and compatible services.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the companies that will benefit from the AR revolution because of its software products. Adobe Aero is a software platform that allows developers to build different AR and VR applications.  Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s research team is also working to develop various AR and VR photography tools and technologies.One of the biggest growth catalysts for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) could be AI. Recently, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and upped its price target on the stock to $625 from $550, citing growth opportunities from generative AI.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

This revolutionary project is set to provide continuous, zero-carbon electricity generated from fusion directly to a Nucor steelmaking facility.Nucor and Helion are diligently collaborating to establish a definitive timeline, and they are fully committed to commencing operations as swiftly as possible, targeting the year 2030 for this ambitious endeavor. To expedite the deployment of fusion technology in the United States, Nucor is making a substantial direct investment of $35 million in Helion. This agreement represents the world's first fusion energy collaboration of such magnitude and holds the potential to spearhead the decarbonization of the entire industrial sector.Helion, renowned for its innovative work in fusion technology, has already achieved significant milestones, including the construction of six operational fusion prototypes and the distinction of being the first private fusion company in the world to reach plasma temperatures of 100 million degrees. Presently, the company is in the process of constructing its seventh prototype, named Polaris, which is anticipated to be the first to demonstrate the generation of electricity through fusion.David Kirtley, CEO of Helion, conveyed the company's deep commitment to reducing global reliance on carbon-based energy sources through the use of clean fusion power.Nucor, which is among the prominent players in the steel space along with United States Steel Corporation X, Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD and ArcelorMittal S.A. MT, known for its environmentally friendly production method centered around recycling, is already recognized as one of the world's most eco-conscious steel manufacturers. The circular approach of recycling scrap materials in electric arc furnaces ensures that Nucor's steel mills have a greenhouse gas emissions intensity that is three times lower than the average extractive blast furnace steelmaking plants.Story continuesAdditionally, Nucor has taken a pioneering step by becoming the first major industrial company to join the UN 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, which is dedicated to expediting the global transition to carbon-free electricity systems and ensuring universal access to clean and affordable electricity.Nucor reported earnings of $5.81 per share for second-quarter 2023, down from earnings of $9.67 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share, however, topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59. NUE recorded net sales of $9,523.3 million, down around 19% year over year. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,733.8 million.Another prominent steel maker, U.S. Steel logged second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. Revenues fell around 20% year over year to $5,008 million in the reported quarter but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,942.8 million.Steel Dynamics, however, missed earnings estimates for the second quarter. Its earnings of $4.81 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.82. Net sales in the second quarter were $5,081.6 million, which also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,405.5 million.ArcelorMittal reported second quarter earnings per share of $2.20, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. Total sales for the quarter were $18,606 million, a 16% year-over-year decrease, missing the Zacks estimate of $19,250.7 million, primarily due to lower steel selling prices and reduced steel shipments.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This was first reported by Reuters that cited people with knowledge of the matter.Since companies are required to keep a record of all business communications but are unable to keep a close tab on off-channel communication, using them to discuss business is a breach.Under the deals being finalized with the SEC, the firms, including TFC, USB and FITB, are likely to pay fines and admit wrongdoing. Firms are also expected to make changes to fix the lapses, including hiring independent consultants to revamp record-keeping programs.The ongoing two-year investigation initially focused on broker-dealers and investment advisers who were fined more than $2 billion in total for using WhatsApp and other unapproved messaging apps. Per sources, the new settlements might see firms paying a total of $50 million in fines.The SEC is expected to announce a few settlements in a group ahead of its fiscal year-end on Sep 30.Previously, the regulator negotiated two other large group settlements as part of the probe by bringing 30 related enforcement actions.Notably, 16 broker-dealers and investment advisers, including TCF, USB and FITB, have acknowledged in regulatory filings that the SEC is probing their communications.Fifth Third does not expect any material impact on its financials related to the settlement negotiations.Deficiencies in Wall Street's record-keeping problem came to light when JPMorgan Chase failed to provide documents from at least 2018 related to an unrelated probe. According to a 2021 settlement, the bank agreed to pay $125 million to the SEC to resolve charges over record-keeping lapses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

July's Amazon Prime Day saw nearly $13 billion in sales.Bargain hunters know the annual Amazon Prime Day retailpalooza as an opportunity to score a bevy of deals on all manner of merchandise. That's why they eagerly await the two-day event.But if you missed out on the event this summer, there will be more opportunities for Prime members to save this month. Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days is taking place October 10 -11, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, in several countries including the United States.Amazon Prime Day dates back to 2015 when it debuted in July to push sales during retail’s usual summer doldrums. At that time it was a novelty (and also just a single day.) But even when Amazon Prime Day was moved to October in 2020 due to pandemic issues, Amazon posted record Prime Day sales and ended up kicking off the holiday shopping season a month early.Amazon Prime Day returned to its summer slot in 2021, but in June, not July. And it was another resounding success, culminating in sales exceeding $11 billion. In 2022, Prime Day recorded $12 billion in sales. Not bad!In 2023, Amazon Prime Day was another two-day extravaganza, taking place on July 11-12, a Tuesday and Wednesday. Prime Day 2023 was the biggest Prime Day event ever for independent sellers. Amazon's 2023 Prime Day recorded just short of $13 billion in sales.What to expect from Amazon Prime Deal Days 2023Prime Deal Days has some stepped-up competition from retailers like Walmart and Target. Target Circle Week goes from October 1 through October 7, 2023. Walmart Deals — Holiday Kickoff will start on Monday, October 9 at 7 p.m. ET, with deals running through October 12. Unlike Walmart's sale in July, you don't need to be a Walmart+ member to take part in this saleIn past years, Prime Day has offered its biggest discounts on Amazon’s proprietary gadgets — including Amazon Echo personal assistance devices (“Alexa…”), Fire TV sticks, Kindles and their ilk — plus a flea-market array of baubles, gewgaws and bric-a-brac from other vendors large and small, as well as items from Amazon’s Grocery supermarket options.Story continuesThat range has led naysayers to dub Prime Day as Amazon’s version of a garage sale: a lot of (sometimes silly) unsold inventory with an occasional true treasure mixed in.Many Prime Day deals get posted well before the big event with some deals available to be preordered by Prime members. Non-members can sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime free trial to tap the sales on Amazon Prime Day. Not satisfied with the Prime offering?

Thomas Simons, Jefferies U.S. Economist joins Yahoo Finance live to shed light on the next steps to take. Simons advises looking into loan services and being aware of what servicer has assumed the loan. Simons also advises looking for government assistance to find a way to “ease your way” back into loan repayment.In terms of consumer trends—Simons predicts certain “discounters” such as Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) will “pick up the slack” in terms of where borrowers will shop in order to save money.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: What should people do in terms of their first checklist of what to do if they have student loans and they really haven't thought about them over the past couple of years?THOMAS SIMONS: Yeah, I mean, that's a really significant issue. I believe I've seen statistics that are kind of all over the place on how much servicer turnover has gone on, but even some of the bigger payment processors from before are no longer handling the debt the way they were before. So absolutely, first thing to do is the check in with who you were, you know, servicing your loan through and see if there's information about who has assumed your loan, see what their terms are, and make sure that all the automatic payment drafting structure is in place.But also, on your own budgeting side, be prepared to figure out how to carve out this extra money from your monthly flow, and make sure also to take a look at what options are available from the government in order to sort of ease back into payments. This is one of the things that Biden was able to get through in the whole rigmarole over the spring with the student loan issue was that there are modification programs that are much more-- much, you know, easier to follow up with and much more successful, probably will be much more successful, I should say, than previous versions.Story continuesAnd also, if you are unable to pay for a month or two, there's-- you know, that late payment isn't going to be reported to a credit agency for a whole year. Thing to keep in mind is that if you are not paying, that you are accruing interest and your balance is going to grow. It's not like it was in 2020 and through 2022, when the interest moratorium was in place.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I mean, and people might not know that interest started kicking in and accruing September 1st, so even though student payments are coming up, that interest already continuing to accrue. I do want to ask you, though, some of the big winners. Obviously we know that as people are going to have to pull back on some of their discretionary spending, you know, won't have as much to spread around, what about some of the companies that benefit from this resuming?THOMAS SIMONS: So there was a lovely graphic that we had on a few minutes ago about a couple of the companies that we've upgraded here at Jefferies, and, really, I think for my own personal view, and I should say I'm not an equity analyst, nor am I specific to single names here, but I do think that the discounters are the ones that are probably going to pick up most of the slack, right? So, I mean, it's Walmart, Target, TJ Maxx like you have there. They will benefit in that big trade down.You know, Costco is an interesting one, because I know that their membership tends to be mostly college graduates. You know, they-- for whatever reason, they just tend to like shopping there, but, you know, I don't know if that means that there's maybe some risk within their customers, but certainly, if they're just trading down brands, you know, discounter and bulk shopping should be doing better as well, I would think.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you would think so, especially the timing of still have high interest rates, people trying to save for homes, certainly a whole perfect storm here of issues here for consumers and borrowers. I appreciate you taking the time to join us. Thomas Simons, Jefferies US economist. Thanks so much.THOMAS SIMONS: Of course. Thank you.]"

BJ recognizes the importance of adaptability and innovation in today's dynamic market and has made significant strides to maintain its competitive edge. Through an unwavering commitment to expanding its membership base, enhancing digital capabilities and relentlessly pursuing operational excellence, the company is not only widening its spectrum but also paving the way for sustained growth.With a strong emphasis on quality, pricing and delivering a seamless shopping experience, the company leaves no stone unturned in fortifying its position in the industry. Beyond these, the company's strategic focus on refining product assortments, expediting club openings and scaling up its delivery services has produced tangible results.Let’s Delve DeepBJ's Wholesale Club’s commitment to bolstering marketing and merchandising capabilities, coupled with its foray into high-demand categories and own-brand portfolio, has yielded remarkable results. These initiatives have played a pivotal role in driving membership signups and renewals, leading to a surge in membership fee income.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, membership fee income witnessed a year-over-year increase of 5%, fueled by strong renewal rates and successful membership acquisition. We foresee a sustained improvement in membership fee income as new club openings ramp up.BJ's Wholesale Club has been directing resources toward expanding digital capabilities to better engage with members and provide them with a convenient way to shop, including same-day delivery, curbside pick-up and buy online, pick up in-club.

Digitally enabled comparable sales rose 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Clubs fulfill approximately 90% of digitally enabled sales.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that BJ's Wholesale Club’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and digitization should keep supporting comparable sales trends.As part of its long-term financial targets, BJ’s Wholesale Club projected a low-to-mid-single-digit-percentage increase in comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales. The company, which shares space with Costco COST, Walmart WMT and Target TGT, guided total revenue growth of a mid-single-digit percentage. It expects a high-single-to-low-double-digit-percentage increase in earnings per share in the long run.A Synopsis of Other StocksCostco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have helped Costco post consistent sales growth.

However, elevated expenses and deteriorating asset quality are concerns.Associated Banc-Corp’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to improve in the upcoming quarters as the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high in the near-term. However, rising funding costs will likely weigh on margins. In 2022, the metric expanded to 2.91% from 2.39% in 2021, driven by higher rates. The momentum continued in the first half of 2023. We expect NIM to be 2.80% in 2023.ASB’s organic growth strategy is driven by its robust loan and deposit balances and efforts to improve fee income. Though revenues took a dip in 2021, it witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% over the five-year period ended 2022. The uptrend persisted in the first six months of 2023. The inclusion of higher-margin lending portfolios and digital investments as part of its strategic plan announced in September 2021 are expected to bolster revenues. We expect total revenues (FTE adjusted) to grow 4.6% and gross loan balance to rise 6.6% in 2023.In order to continue its focus on core operations, ASB is restructuring its business. In 2020, the company divested the insurance business, Associated Benefits &amp; Risk Consulting, while in 2021, it sold its wealth management subsidiary Whitnell &amp; Co. ASB has been into inorganic expansions as well. It acquired First Staunton Bancshares in 2020 and 32 branches in Winconsin in 2019. These deals continue to be accretive to its earnings.Similarly, headquartered in Columbus, OH, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated’s HBAN acquisitions remain a major contributor to its top-line growth. Over the past few years, the company has significantly expanded its operations through acquisitions. Such efforts will aid HBAN to gain significant market share and improve profitability.However, persistent rise in non-interest expenses is a concern for Associated Banc-Corp. Expenses witnessed a CAGR of 1% over the last five years ended 2022. The growth persisted in the first six months of 2023. Owing to the inorganic growth efforts, digitization, investment in franchise and inflationary pressure, expenses are expected to remain elevated. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3.1% in 2023.Likewise, another company in the banking space, Commerce Bancshares, Inc. CBSH, has been witnessing a steady rise in non-interest expenses. Expenses recorded a CAGR of 2.7% over the past six years ended 2022. The trend persisted in the first six months of 2023. With investments made for technology upgrades amid inflationary pressure, overall expenses are expected to remain elevated for CBSH.Another key issue to consider is Associated Banc-Corp’s deteriorating asset quality. The company witnessed a rise in provision for credit losses in 2022 and the first half of 2023. The asset quality is expected to weaken further, given the expectation of a worsening macroeconomic backdrop. We expect provision for credit losses to surge 187.4% in 2023.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Because QML qualifications are standardized based on specific performance and quality requirements governed by the DLA, customers can streamline their design process by using QML-qualified products.Low-power and reprogrammable RT PolarFire FPGAs offer expanded logic density and high performance, providing significant improvements in signal processing throughput. Unlike SRAM-based FPGA alternatives, these devices do not exhibit any configuration Single-Event Upsets (SEUs) in radiation and therefore do not require mitigation, which reduces engineering expenses and Bill of Materials (BOM) costs.“The RT PolarFire FPGA reduces satellite signal processing congestion with higher levels of density and performance than any other product in our FPGA portfolio,” said Shakeel Peera, vice president of marketing for Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “Microchip is committed to providing high-quality and reliable solutions, and this milestone qualification provides customers with added confidence when designing our devices into their spaceflight systems.”MIL-STD-883B, the baseline qualification standard for QML Class Q, sets forth strict methods for testing microelectronic devices to ensure they are suitable for military and aerospace electronic systems. To achieve QML Class Q qualification, the RT PolarFire FPGA went through rigorous assessments to determine its ability to withstand the harmful effects of natural elements and brutal conditions found in defense and space operations.Story continuesBy achieving QML Class Q qualification, RT PolarFire FPGAs prove their ability to support systems that require the highest level of component quality. In addition, the QML Class Q qualification paves the way for an eventual QML Class V qualification while demonstrating the continued reliability of RT PolarFire FPGAs in space applications.For more than 60 years, Microchip’s solutions have powered space flight missions. The company boasts one of the industry’s most comprehensive space product portfolios of radiation-hardened and RT solutions that includes high-performance microcontrollers (MCUs), microprocessors (MPUs), FPGAs, memories, communication interfaces, frequency and timing solutions, mixed-signal ICs, custom power supplies, diodes, transistors, RF components and more. To learn more, visit Microchip's space application product page.About the RT PolarFire FPGA FamilyThe RT PolarFire FPGA family brings Microchip’s 60 years of space flight heritage to a product line that delivers the necessary computing and connectivity throughput for modern space missions. These FPGAs consume up to 50 percent less power than SRAM-based alternatives while enabling on-orbit data processing systems to meet demanding performance requirements and reliable operation without excessive heat generation in the harsh radiation environment of space. Their unique combination of Logic Elements (LEs), embedded SRAM, DSP blocks and 12.7 Gbps transceiver lanes enables higher resolution for passive and active imaging, more channels and finer channel resolution for multi-spectral and hyper-spectral imaging and more precise scientific measurements using noisy data from remote sources.RT PolarFire FPGAs can also be paired with one or more complementary Microchip solutions in today’s space flight systems including the MIC69303RT 3A Low-Dropout (LDO) voltage regulator, VSC8541RT and VSC8574RT Ethernet PHYs, CAN interface USB-to-UART PHYs and a variety of clocks and oscillators.AvailabilityThe RT PolarFire RTPF500T FPGA with QML Class Q qualification in B and E screening flows is available now in production quantities in hermetically sealed ceramic packages with land grid and solder column termination options. The DLA’s designated Standard Microcircuit Drawing (SMD) part numbers for RTPF500T with cross references are noted here.Manufacturers who have already adopted these FPGAs for their next-generation space flight systems will have their orders scheduled for shipment. Manufacturers who are waiting for successful QML qualification can now commit to RT PolarFire FPGAs by starting design work. Designs based on these FPGAs are developed and programmed using version 2021.3 or newer of Microchip’s Libero® SoC Design Suite and are supported by development boards and radiation data.ResourcesHigh-res images available through Flickr (feel free to publish):Application Image: www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/52734943236/sizes/l/About MicrochipMicrochip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -13.07% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.52 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In comparison, the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield is 2.07%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.71%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.44%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 33%, which means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MET expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.78 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 13.58%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Their strategic acquisitions drive innovation, enhance content, and foster new product development. Efficient management execution has resulted in strong cash flow, empowering the company to invest in strategic growth endeavors.S&amp;P Global second-quarter earnings match the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpass the same. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of $3.12 were up 11% year over year. Revenues of $3.1 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by 1.1% and improved 3.6% year over year, backed by the synergies from Market Scan Information Systems and ChartIQ.Factors Boding WellS&amp;P Global is in a strong position to benefit from the rising demand for business information services. The ever-expanding volume of data from both private and government entities has created a greater need for enhanced visibility into financial performance across enterprises. This increased demand for news, information, and analytics solutions is expected to be a key driver of market growth. Additionally, the industry is experiencing a boost in demand for risk mitigation services.Acquisitions play a pivotal role in S&amp;P Global's growth strategy, enabling the company to foster innovation, expand its range of distinctive content, and introduce new products.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Callon Petroleum How Fast Is Callon Petroleum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Callon Petroleum has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Callon Petroleum's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$13.16 to US$15.07. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 14% gain.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Despite consistency in EBIT margins year on year, Callon Petroleum has actually recorded a dip in revenue. This does not bode too well for short term growth prospects and so understanding the reasons for these results is of great importance.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Callon Petroleum?Story continuesAre Callon Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.The good news is that Callon Petroleum insiders spent a whopping US$2.1m on stock in just one year, without so much as a single sale. Knowing this, Callon Petroleum will have have all eyes on them in anticipation for the what could happen in the near future. We also note that it was the Independent Director, Steven Webster, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$1.5m for shares at about US$31.63 each.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Callon Petroleum is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. To be specific, they have US$46m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 1.7% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Shareholders have more to smile about than just insiders adding more shares to their already sizeable holdings. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Joe Gatto is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Callon Petroleum with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b is about US$6.8m.Callon Petroleum offered total compensation worth US$4.2m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Callon Petroleum Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Callon Petroleum is that it is growing profits. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Callon Petroleum (1 is concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Even though The Institute for Supply Management's factory index remains in contractionary territory overall - the longest stretch since the 2007-2009 Great Recession - activity is clearly building again.The good news for inflation worriers is that the prices paid by those businesses fell by more than 5 points during the month.What's more, the recent spike in crude oil prices appears to be going into reverse again.Ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Wednesday, crude oil prices fell back to their lowest in three weeks - dipping back below $88 per barrel and dragging year-on-year gains down to just 5%.Story continuesBut in another pivotal week for U.S. labor data culminating in the September employment report on Friday, attention will flip to August job openings numbers later on Tuesday for clues about the ongoing tightness of the jobs market - central to the Fed's deliberations.Fed hawkishness, however, has kept futures markets pricing a 50-50 chance of another quarter point rate hike to the 5.50-5.75% range by year-end.Whether the weekend's stopgap measure to keep U.S. government open until Nov. 17 just builds more uncertainty into that year-end period leaves markets on edge entering the final quarter.Rising 10-year nominal and real yields grind on regardless - as the Fed view combines with a rethink of a more high pressured economy longer-term as well as negative market dynamics and positioning.A so-called 'bear steepening' of the 2-10 year yield curve to its least inverted in five months is an aggravator for bond funds, as is hedge fund activity that sees these speculators reluctant to cover huge short positions in Treasury futures.Bond volatility captured by the MOVE index hit its highest in almost six weeks on Monday.The dollar continues to be the big beneficiary - hitting its highest level of the year against the euro and only balking at a one-year high at 150 yen due to wariness of Bank of Japan intervention.The Australian dollar skidded to its lowest level of the year after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its key policy rate unchanged at 4.10% overnight.For U.S. stocks, the picture is harder to parse - as investors juggle the better U.S. growth projections with the higher-for-longer rate squeeze.As the third-quarter earnings season hoves into view this month, the S&amp;P500 held the line on Monday despite climbing long-term borrowing rates and Big Tech stocks, typically most sensitive to interest rates, outperformed.And futures were a smidgen higher again ahead of Tuesday's bell.In company news, Birkenstock - the German premium footwear brand backed by private-equity firm L Catterton - targeted a fully diluted valuation of about $10 billion in its highly anticipated U.S. initial public offering, according to filings.And British online fashion retailer Boohoo dropped 10% after it said revenue fell 17% in the six months to August and warned of a similar decline for the full year.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:* US Aug job openings data* Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic speaks* U.S. Treasury auctions 12-month bills* U.S. corporate earnings: McCormick(Reporting by Mike Dolan; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

""Macroeconomic stability is fully ensured by the actions of the macro regulator and the government, so there are no grounds for concern here.""Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.8% at $90.01 a barrel, its weakest in almost a month, but still well above its 2023 average.The Russian currency tends to come under pressure at the start of each month, after losing the support of a favourable month-end tax period that usually sees exporters convert FX revenues to meet local liabilities.""Expensive oil and an increase in the key rate are improving the outlook for the rouble, but in the medium-term,"" Promsvyazbank analysts said. They expected the rouble to make a short-lived move beyond 100 to the dollar in the absence of new support measures from the authorities.'PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER'President Vladimir Putin's economic adviser rebuked the central bank as the rouble slid to 101.75 per dollar in August, blaming its loose policy in a sign of growing internal discord.Story continues""This level (100) is not a technical resistance, it's an important psychological barrier,"" said Alor Broker's Alexei Antonov. ""For now, everything speaks in favour of the rouble continuing to get cheaper.""Following the August emergency hike, the central bank raised rates again in September to 13%. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank, also grappling with stubborn inflationary pressure, to tighten monetary policy again at its next scheduled meeting on Oct. 27.The rouble has charted a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenue.Falling exports, hit by Western sanctions and shifting trade flows, combined with a recovery in imports this year has caused the rouble to weaken. Russia's current account surplus shrank 86% year-on-year to $25.6 billion in January-August.

(MSBNA), a national bank subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), has been recognized with the highest rating from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for its work meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves. The Bank received a rating of ""Outstanding"" for the Bank’s community reinvestment activities. Both of the Firm’s national bank subsidiaries have achieved consistent ""Outstanding"" ratings based on the OCC’s review of community reinvestment activities.The OCC report for MSBNA highlights several initiatives that contributed to the ""Outstanding"" rating including nearly $6 billion in combined community development loans and investments that addressed the need of affordable housing, resident services to strengthen communities, and capital for small businesses over the three-year exam period.""Morgan Stanley is very proud to have received, for the eighth time in a row, an ""Outstanding"" rating from the OCC for our community reinvestment work,"" said Michael Pizzi, Head of U.S. Banks and Head of Technology. ""Our program’s continued focus on affordable housing and economic development remains our priority in the communities we serve.""The evaluation noted that the Bank’s community development lending and investment performance was ""excellent"" and ""the Bank was responsive to identified community needs and supports services that targeted affordable housing, financial education, social services for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals, and services for small businesses.""""Morgan Stanley continues to leverage our capital markets expertise to support affordable housing and economic development, which contribute to thriving communities,"" continued Mr. Pizzi.The Performance Evaluation highlighted several transactions, including:Story continuesMore than $375 million in loans to community development financial institutions (CDFIs) in the Bank’s local, regional, and national areas over the three-year exam period (2020-2022). MSBNA recognized the critical role that CDFIs played in stabilizing and revitalizing communities, particularly those with considerable needs exacerbated by the pandemic. One example included a $9 million revolving line of credit to a CDFI to fund affordable housing projects and working capital for distressed neighborhoods. The CDFI builds new single- and multi-family housing, rehabilitates existing housing stock and works to revitalize neighborhoods in Salt Lake City and around the state of Utah.Due to the unique nature of MSBNA’s Wholesale Bank designation for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Bank is able to leverage its expertise to meet community needs across the nation in addition to serving its local assessment area. This regional and national focus allowed the Bank to respond to disaster areas, invest in rural CRA ""deserts,"" and preserve affordable housing nationwide at a time when the country faces a severe affordable housing crisis.One of the projects that helped rebuild in the wake of a natural disaster was Phase I and II of Laurel at Perennial Park in Santa Rosa, California. Working with Burbank Housing Development Corporation (BHDC), the Bank provided both affordable housing construction loans and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) equity to the redevelopment project. The Bank’s financing created 132 units of affordable housing for seniors 62+. The site, formerly the Journey’s End Mobile Home Park, was destroyed by the Tubbs wildfire in 2017.""Morgan Stanley has served as a trusted advisor throughout the life cycle of the redevelopment at 3575 Mendocino Avenue, now Laurel at Perennial Park,"" says Larry Florin, CEO of Burbank Housing. ""Morgan Stanley was a key first responder to the natural disaster and was able to creatively and flexibly design their response by listening to the needs of the community first, and then bring capital to the table based on those identified needs. They have made responding to disaster areas one of their priorities, which really sets them apart as a partner.""The Bank also offered SBA 504 loans for small businesses, financing for the construction and preservation of affordable housing, and LIHTC investments across rural areas where capital is often more sparse than urban markets. For example, projects in Fresno and Mineral Wells, Texas and Los Alamos, New Mexico received a variety of community development funding.Mike Mantle, Head of Community Development Finance at Morgan Stanley said, ""Morgan Stanley continually looks for ways to make an impact in the communities we serve. Affordable housing is a major focus given the critical need we see across the country. However, the capital we deploy through the SBA 504 program, particularly in rural markets, helps provide critically needed loans for small businesses. These businesses in turn create or retain local jobs.

(NYSE: FE), recently completed its annual emergency preparation drill focused on testing its storm restoration process in the event severe weather causes outages throughout its vast and heavily forested service area.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Individuals participated in the storm drill both remotely and in-person at Penelec's centrally located Clearfield facility – a hybrid approach similar to how employees conduct real-life restoration activities using electronic storm tools to manage work in the field. The drill was designed to prepare employees assigned to storm restoration duties and review restoration processes and storm-management tools critical to safely and quickly getting the lights back on.""Storm drills provide our employees a controlled forum to practice and sharpen their skills in preparation for severe weather, including thunderstorms packing gusty winds in the summer and snow and ice events in the winter,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""Regular emergency drills are another way we work to improve electric service for our customers, in addition to tree trimming and projects we do to harden our electric infrastructure and enhance its resiliency.""The recently completed drill's hypothetical scenario focused on ""Winter Storm April,"" a potent system that swept into Pennsylvania from the southwest on a Friday in mid-December, dropping more than 2 feet of snow in several areas of Penelec's service territory over two days. Widespread wind gusts exceeded 50 miles per hour.Similar to the type of storms that can affect Penelec customers in the winter and spring, the drill's severe weather toppled trees and damaged power lines, knocking out electricity to more than 75% of Penelec's customers. In the exercise, plows could not keep pace with the accumulating snow, leaving numerous roads impassable and slowing crews in their efforts to access damage and make repairs.Story continuesAs part of the training, Penelec activated its Incident Command System (ICS). ICS is a nationally recognized and accepted emergency management process used by all levels of government – federal, state and local – as well as by many non-governmental organizations and the private sector to coordinate the response to major storms or other natural disasters.In the aftermath of a major weather event, Penelec crews follow a formal restoration process and typically address outages that restore the largest number of customers before moving to more isolated problems. They generally prioritize hospitals and other critical medical facilities, communications facilities and emergency response agencies. After that, crews work to restore power as quickly as possible to the rest of the customers.For more information about FirstEnergy's storm restoration process and tips for staying safe, visit the 24/7 Power Center at www.firstenergycorp.com/outages.Penelec serves approximately 585,000 customers within 17,600 square miles of northern and central Pennsylvania.

(NYSE:CRM) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Is Salesforce Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.94bUS$10.1bUS$12.1bUS$14.3bUS$16.6bUS$18.4bUS$19.9bUS$21.1bUS$22.2bUS$23.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x25Analyst x29Analyst x17Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 10.53%Est @ 8.01%Est @ 6.25%Est @ 5.02%Est @ 4.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$7.4kUS$8.8kUS$9.8kUS$10.8kUS$11.7kUS$12.1kUS$12.2kUS$12.0kUS$11.8kUS$11.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$108bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$461bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$461b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$228bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$336b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$204, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.024. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SalesforceStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for CRM.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Mistakes New Business Owners Make.Why Do Businesses Fail?There are a number of reasons that eventually lead to business failure, ranging from improper planning to underestimating costs, despite having a terrific business idea.Quibi was a short film content generation business based in the United States. The company targeted people who used mobile devices to stream content. The business was formed in 2020 and within 6 months of operation, the company had to shut down. Similarly every year numerous businesses sign bankruptcy or shut down operations. Not all businesses require hefty setup costs, but making smart decisions with capital management is necessary, regardless. You can check out some of the most profitable businesses with low startup costs.One such business that happened to fail in 2023 was Bitwise Industries. Bitwise Industries was a computer programming and technology company based in the United States. The company was formed in 2010 and filed for its shutdown this year in 2023. The company ran out of money despite having received $80 million in funding on February 28, as reported by Reuters. The company filed for bankruptcy on June 29, after having fired its employees weeks ago.What Do Some Businesses Do Differently? However, some businesses have been operating for years boasting success and prominent growth. These companies employ the right strategies at the right time and make cost-efficient decisions. Some of the prominent names include Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH). Let's study their growth and what they did differently.Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) offers services in cloud-based industries, including monitoring of databases, servers, and tools through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. On August 8, Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.36 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.08. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $509.46 million and was ahead of market consensus by $65.26 million. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) grew its revenue by 25.44% in the second quarter.Story continuesSnowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a cloud computing company based in the United States. The company was founded in 2010 and continues to thrive through engaging in strategic partnerships. On September 8, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) reported on the updates to its partnership with Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) ""Bring Your Own Lake"" (BYOL) data sharing fosters a collaborative link between Snowflake Inc.'s (NYSE:SNOW) and Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) data cloud platform. The two combined allow users to easily convert their database into crucial insights, and also offer a bidirectional data-sharing capability through the launch of the BYOL Data Federation, allowing users to access data from Snowflake on the Salesforce Data Cloud. The tools are extremely beneficial for data analysts, the sales function, and the marketing function. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) is a software company that was founded in Romania but is now based in the United States. The company offers AI-powered business automation platforms. On May 10, the UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) released some of its new AI features. The features enhance workflow by streamlining all activities and automating them. The features offered lie under four primary categories including AI-powered automation, powerful developer tools, enterprise-grade management, and faster time to automation value. The tools range from generative AI, and automated cloud robots, to ROI comparisons and analysis. You can also check out some of the best-funded AI startups in 2023.As discussed, few startups make it to become prominent members of the industry. These businesses continue to invest in technology and innovation. They are able to pivot to new avenues of growth when existing means of revenue seem to slow down. However, not all startups and small business owners learn or reflect on their strategies, often signing themselves up for failure. With that, let's discuss the 17 biggest mistakes new business owners make.17 Biggest Mistakes New Business Owners MakeOur MethodologyFor the article, 17 biggest mistakes new business owners make, we employed a consensus approach. Since it is a very subjective topic, it was quite challenging to rank our list. We sourced our data from 6 sources. These include LinkedIn, Shopify, The Guardian, and three reports by Forbes published separately. Extracting information from all six sources brought our total count to 70. Of the 70, the common mistakes were selected and ranked based on the number of times an item appeared across the 6 sources. If an item appeared in all six sources, it was awarded with an insider monkey score of 6. The list is in ascending order of the aforementioned metric.It is to be noted that items with a similar score are ranked back to back in our list.17 Biggest Mistakes New Business Owners Make17. Neglecting Overall ManagementInsider Monkey Score: 3Based on our methodology, neglecting the overall management of the business is one of the biggest mistakes a new business owner can make. Micro-managing every function of the business leaves little time for overlooking business functions, strategizing, and establishing quarterly goals for each function. Some of the most prominent companies that have come a long way since going public include Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH).16. Refusing to Pivot or InnovateInsider Monkey Score: 3Continuing to invest in a business idea or industry no longer providing an opportunity for growth is one of the biggest mistakes a business owner can make. Businesses should be able to pivot and innovate when the current opportunity stops offering growth.15. Not Designating a Budget for MarketingInsider Monkey Score: 3Not allocating a budget for marketing is one of the biggest mistakes a new business owner can make. In today's digital world, the marketing expense for business is not limited to creating advertisements, in fact, there are smarter ways to go about it through digital marketing. Small businesses need to set aside enough budget for social media, content creation, search engine ads, and SEO to name a few. 14. No Clarity on Long Term GoalsInsider Monkey Score: 4Not establishing attainable and clear long-term goals for business is one of the biggest mistakes a new business owner can make. These long-term goals must be reflected in the corporate goals a company sets in the short run. A business owner who is unclear on where to take the new business in the next five years or ten, lacks vision. 13. Fear of FailureInsider Monkey Score: 4Taking a pessimistic approach toward a new business is one of the biggest mistakes a new business owner can make. An optimistic outlook is essential when it comes to setting up and executing a new business. Business owners must be prepared to face roadblocks during the journey but must move forward with a solution-oriented approach. 12. Huge Focus on the Product Insider Monkey Score: 4Business owners with unique product ideas often dismiss the possibility that the customer may not even want the product. An immense focus on the product rather than the customer as a new business often results in a huge risk of customers not wanting or liking the product, no matter how unique or useful it is. 11. Lack of Focus  Insider Monkey Score: 4The euphoria that comes with setting up a new business often results in owners making big mistakes. One of the most common mistakes new business owners make is a lack of focus. While testing and experimenting with different things is key, companies should be able to define the parameters within which they are to operate, or experiment. Setting foot into every domain as a small business is not wise and may be counterproductive.10. Unclear Goals &amp; Objectives  Insider Monkey Score: 4Stemming from a lack of planning, new business owners often set unclear business goals and objectives. These goals may lack focus, specificity, a basis for measurement, a defined time frame, and business relevance. At times, the goals set by owners may be unattainable or unrealistic to achieve as a small business or startup. Goals for each function should reflect the long-term goals and corporate objectives of a business. 9. Limited Focus on Profit Insider Monkey Score: 4While sales revenue is integral to the running of a business, a lack of focus on profit results in businesses going bankrupt. Moreover, a company not offering enough returns to its shareholders is not a good sign for investors and other stakeholders alike. A high sales revenue does not necessarily translate to a high profit. Companies must ensure that a high sales revenue does not come at the expense of high costs. Instead, a focus on earning a profit or increasing margins should be vital. 8. Poor Hiring DecisionsInsider Monkey Score: 4Poor hiring decisions or hiring without a plan is one of the biggest mistakes new business owners can make. Moving forward with key human resource decisions without sufficient planning is a key issue resulting in long-term adverse impacts. New businesses often under hire or over hire, neglecting the growth and revenue potential of the company. This not only adds costs to the business but it also wastes sufficient time for the HR function.7. Doing Everything on Your OwnInsider Monkey Score: 4While information technology, automation, and artificial intelligence eliminate the need for companies to hire a plethora of workers, owners often end up doing everything on their own. Strategizing and overlooking all the business functions is tiresome on its own, and attempting to take care of minuscule tasks results in owners feeling unmotivated and lost. 6. Overspending Insider Monkey Score: 4Overspending is a common mistake new business owners make. In all the glitz and glamor of a new business, owners often end up spending more than they can afford. Overspending could stem from hiring professionals demanding high salaries or overdoing the office space setup. Moreover, without prior testing, businesses often end up producing way more than the market demand, often resulting in a lack of funds or revenue to pay for the expense. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) are some of the top businesses that have grown immensely by taking key strategic decisions at the right time.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Biggest Mistakes New Business Owners Make.Suggested Articles:15 Most Innovative Startups in Sports20 Best-Funded AI Startups in 202330 Most Profitable Businesses With Low Startup CostsDisclosure: None. 17 Biggest Mistakes New Business Owners Make is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model (LLM) and uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Einstein GPT is the world’s first generative AI CRM technology, which delivers AI-created content across every sales, services, marketing, commerce and IT interaction at hyperscale. With Einstein GPT, the company will transform customer experience with generative AI.Upping its ante in the space, CRM launched its AI Cloud service in June 2023, which is the company’s one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across CRM’s products, including the Einstein service, data analysis software, Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Investing Big on Generative AIIn March 2023, CRM raised its venture capital fund for generative AI to $500 million from $250 million. With this enhanced fund, Salesforce Ventures, the company’s global investment arm, will support the generative AI ecosystem and promote the development of responsible and trusted technology.Last week, Salesforce announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Airkit.ai, a startup that develops AI-powered customer service applications. However, the company didn’t disclose the financial terms of the agreement but expects to close the transaction during the second half of fiscal 2024.Story continuesFounded in 2017, Airkit.ai is a low-code platform that helps e-commerce companies build AI-powered customer engagement applications that can be deployed across multiple channels, including web, mobile and messaging apps.Other Companies Integrating Generative AIGenerative AI technology is finding applications in marketing, advertising, drug development, legal contracts, video gaming, customer support and digital art. This has sparked AI competition among the world’s biggest tech players, including Intuit INTU, ServiceNow NOW and Adobe ADBE.In June 2023, Intuit expanded its platform architecture with the introduction of a proprietary generative AI operating system — GenOS. This will enable the company to design, build and deploy breakthrough generative AI experiences for millions of customers, including small businesses. It will also help customers solve their financial challenges.Intuit’s GenOS features custom-trained financial LLMs that specialize in solving tax, accounting, marketing, cash flow and personal finance challenges. The LLMs, combined with the company’s network of domain experts and data protection controls, intend to provide actionable insights and invoke actions like contacting human experts.Earlier this year, ServiceNow launched generative AI capabilities — ServiceNow Generative AI Controller and Now Assist for Search — for the Now platform that helps deliver faster and more intelligent workflow automation.The digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly will offer more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It will let users create high-quality images and stunning text effects.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.The Federal Reserve’s September meeting and Jerome Powell’s tone afterwards has dampened hopes of a soft landing. The central bank’s battle against inflation is far from over and there are many other challenges that are coming to hit the economy in the coming months. According to a report by Fortune, Jesse Wheeler, senior economist at the decision intelligence firm MorningConsult, recently warned that the market could face several challenges as the analyst sees “storm clouds out there forming.”One of these storms could be the threat of government shutdown (yet again). Some other challenges highlighted by analysts include rising oil prices and the UAW strike that is hitting major automakers in the US. The Fortune report cited Wells Fargo senior economist Mike Pugliese, who said that the impact of a possible government shutdown would be severe.“While there is never a good time for the federal government to shut down, the potential for one in the current economic environment is more concerning. Not only would a shutdown reduce economic growth modestly, but it would create a data vacuum at a time when the path ahead for the economy is highly uncertain,” Pugliese said.But markets are almost always facing some sort of storms. For beginner investors, it all boils down to finding solid companies and waiting it out.MethodologyFor this article, we first listed all the holding of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and then gauged hedge fund sentiment for all these stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We then picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We skipped companies that are cyclical, are about to acquired or are going through a lot of volatility and uncertainties. Analysts and experts recommend beginner investors to have exposure to broader market ETFs to have a safety cushion and almost guaranteed gains (albeit small) over longer periods of time. That’s why we decided to use the holdings data of the SPY ETF.Story continuesBest Stocks for BeginnersPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashBest Beginner Stocks To Buy Now15. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 15th in our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has strong growth catalysts on the back of its AI offerings. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) earlier this year introduced an AI product suite and is also integrating several generative AI features in its existing products.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company. The biggest stakeholder of Adobe during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $658 million stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”14. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the safest stocks out there. The healthcare services company is operating in an industry that is resilient and does not feel drastic effects of broader market downturns. The company has increased its dividends consistently for the last 14 years now.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 111 hedge funds reported owning stakes in UNH. The most significant stakeholder of the firm during this period was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Mairs &amp; Power Growth Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”13. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy for long-term growth. Analysts believe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will launch several new products to grab the lucrative generative AI market in the coming weeks and months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) would be the biggest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chips market.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AMD. The most significant stakeholder of the company was Philippe Laffont’s  Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the June 2023 quarter the AI bubble continued to inflate. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as a key challenger to Nvidia, will benefit from increased demand for its next generation semiconductor chips. AMD’s share price is reflecting very bullish sentiment and the share price has run ahead of a reasonable base case valuation. Accordingly, we divested our entire position and moved AMD to our Bench.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is a strong dividend-paying bank stock with stability and strong fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) shares have gained about 38% over the past 12 months. Thanks to its size and dominance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) usually does not feel any effects of banking sector jitters since depositors flock to major banks like JPMorgan when small banks falter.11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks to buy for beginners. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) earlier this year launched several new features for its CRM platform. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) recently held its Dreamforce conference and investment firm Baird praised the event. Baird analyst Rob Oliver said he came out of the event feeling positive about the company’s AI offerings. The analyst has a $220 price target and a Neutral rating on the stock.Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff in Q2 earnings call talked about Salesforce’s generative AI initiatives in detail and said:“We’re democratizing generative AI, making it very easy for our customers to implement every job, every business in every industry. And I will just say that in the last few months, we’ve injected a new layer of generative AI assistance across all of the Customer 360. And you can see it with our salespeople who are now using our Sales Cloud GPT, which has been incredible, what we’ve released this quarter to all of our customers and here inside Salesforce. And then when we see that, they all say to themselves, you know what, in this new world, everyone can now be in Einstein. But democratizing generative AI at scale for the biggest brands in the world requires more than — that’s just these large language models and deep learning algorithms, and we all know that because a lot of our customers kind of think and they have tried and they go and they pull something off a Hugging Face, it is an amazing company.We just invested in their new round and grab a model and put some data in it and nothing happens. And then they don’t understand and they call us and say, hey, what’s happening here? I thought that this AI was so amazing and it’s like, well, it takes a lot to actually get this intelligence to occur. And that’s what I think that’s the value that Salesforce is bringing is that we’re really able to help our customers achieve this kind of technological superiority right out of the box just using our products in a low code, no code way. It’s really just democratization of generative AI at scale. And that is really what we’re trying to achieve that at the heart of every one of these AI transformations becomes our intelligent, integrated and incredible Salesforce platform, and we’re going to show all of that at Dreamforce.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”10.

These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 5/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 1/10Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned PG&amp;E Corp the GF Score of 54 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.PG&amp;E Corp Business OverviewPG&amp;E Corp, with a market cap of $38.83 billion, is a holding company whose main subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric. This regulated utility operates in Central and Northern California, serving 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties. PG&amp;E operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020. In 2004, PG&amp;E sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier post-bankruptcy reorganization. The company's sales stand at $22.26 billion with an operating margin of 9.35%.Story continuesPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.89 positions it worse than 94.65% of 430 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.43, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.35, which is worse than 90.27% of 452 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 8.18, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.37% of 439 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Profitability AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. PG&amp;E Corp's Operating Margin has declined over the past five years ((-22.59%)), as shown by the following data: 2018: 12.36; 2019: 7.83; 2020: 10.86; 2021: 10.37; 2022: 9.57; .Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where PG&amp;E Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -32.1 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 98.54% of 481 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Lastly, PG&amp;E Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.PG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven PG&amp;E Corp's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a rich history and a significant market presence, its current financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance levels. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This comprehensive analysis will delve into PG&amp;E's valuation and financial performance to provide an answer. Continue reading to gain valuable insights.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PCG. Click here to check it out. PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E Corp (NYSE:PCG) is a holding company whose main subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric, is a regulated utility operating in Central and Northern California. Serving 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties, PG&amp;E has a significant presence in the utilities sector. The company operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020, and in 2004, sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier post-bankruptcy reorganization. Currently, PG&amp;E's stock price stands at $15.54, while the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $12.57. This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's intrinsic value.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesAt its current price of $15.54 per share, PG&amp;E has a market cap of $38.90 billion. Given this, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) is believed to be modestly overvalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Hence, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. PG&amp;E has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, which ranks worse than 95.42% of 480 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks PG&amp;E's financial strength as 3 out of 10, suggesting a poor balance sheet.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationProfitability and GrowthIt is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. PG&amp;E has been profitable 6 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $22.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.91. Its operating margin is 9.35%, which ranks worse than 56.89% of 501 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Overall, the profitability of PG&amp;E is ranked 5 out of 10, which indicates fair profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth, according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of PG&amp;E is -32.1%, which ranks worse than 98.54% of 481 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 0%, which ranks worse than 0% of 455 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, PG&amp;E's ROIC is 7.59 while its WACC came in at 6.35.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationConclusionOverall, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) stock is believed to be modestly overvalued. The company's financial condition is poor and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 0% of 455 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.

49,73187dcf-a31b-3e83-ab16-4f59ace4e868,PCG,2023-10-03,Ticking Time Bombs: 3 Energy Stocks to Dump Before the Damage Is Done,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ticking-time-bombs-3-energy-220014572.html,1695765614,STORY,"['CVX', 'PCG', 'XOM']","[The energy market in 2023 is facing a paradoxical situation. On one hand, oil and gas prices have largely rebounded from their historic lows in 2020 and 2021, thanks to geopolitics around the Russian-Ukrainian war and the supply constraints imposed by OPEC and its allies. On the other hand, not all oil and gas companies have been able to capitalize on this favorable trend, as they face multiple secular headwinds or company-specific obstacles that limit their growth prospects as well as profitability.With all that said, below are three energy stocks public equities investors should avoid before more damage is done to their shares.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest oil and gas companies in the U.S., Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), has been lagging behind its peers in investing in renewable energy and reducing its carbon footprint. Moreover, the oil and gas company has been embroiled in lawsuits, protests and divestments from shareholders and activists who have accused the U.S.-based oil giant of misleading the public about the risks of climate change. Exxon Mobil’s profits have suffered from lower oil and gas prices compared to last year, as well as higher production costs and declining reserves. Its liquified natural gas (LNG) business, which was previously affected by oil prices, just started to recover in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe company’s quarterly revenue and earnings in 2023 are still below pre-pandemic levels, and ExxonMobil’s dividend yield has decreased. As oil prices continue to etch upward, public equities investors are perhaps better off investing in other energy stocks.PG&amp;E (PCG)the PG&amp;E logo on the front of a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) a California-based utility company, has been plagued by wildfires, blackouts and bankruptcy. The company has been held responsible for several devastating fires caused by its faulty equipment and poor maintenance. PG&amp;E has also been struggling to meet the state’s renewable energy targets and to upgrade its aging infrastructure.Story continuesThe utility company has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection twice in the past two decades and has agreed to pay billions of dollars in settlements and fines. PG&amp;E’s stock price has plummeted over 75% since its $71.00/share high in 2017. With the utilities company’s outlook remaining cloudy due to its tarnished reputation and slowing year-over-year revenue growth in 2023, I believe investors should continue to avoid this one.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is also one of the largest oil and gas companies in the United States. This oil and gas giant has also been slow to embrace the transition to renewable energy and to address its environmental impact. Furthermore, the company has faced criticism for its involvement in controversial projects, such as the Keystone XL pipeline and the Ecuadorian Amazon litigation.Outside of the controversies, the oil and gas company’s earnings have also been in limbo. For their second quarter earning print in 2023, Chevron posted a slump in bottom-line profits for its upstream business, which deals with the production of crude oil and natural gas, due to lower domestic oil and natural gas prices. These factors could change as these commodities are expected to rise in price in the second half of 2023. However, I am still not convinced Chevron, riddled with controversy, is the best play for energy stocks right now.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, both stocks look poised for a sharp rebound considering their strengthening outlook amid higher oil prices.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCompelling MomentumInvestors should be on the lookout for energy companies with rising earnings estimates as Q3 results approach. This will largely correlate with energy stocks that could rip higher and have benefited from the surge in oil prices over the last quarter.Considering this scenario, Marathon Oil and Viper Energy are very compelling. Notably, Marathon Oil’s fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have climbed 15% in the last 60 days with FY24 EPS estimates soaring 21%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Viper Energy, in the last two months its FY23 and FY24 earnings estimates have skyrocketed 51% and 35% respectively.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESPAdding fuel to Marathon Oil and Viper Energy’s momentum is the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 3.17, this article aims to answer the question: is Marathon Oil fairly valued? In the following analysis, we'll delve into the company's valuation, financial strength, profitability, and growth to provide an informed perspective.Company OverviewMRO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MROMarathon Oil is an independent exploration and production company, primarily focusing on unconventional resources in the United States. As of the end of 2022, the company reported net proved reserves of 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net production averaged 343 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, with a ratio of 70% oil and NGLs and 30% natural gas. With a current stock price of $25.84 and a GF Value of $28.45, Marathon Oil has a market cap of $15.60 billion, indicating that the stock is fairly valued.Marathon Oil (MRO)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at.Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is estimated to be fairly valued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. Because Marathon Oil is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Marathon Oil (MRO)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Marathon Oil has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.04, ranking worse than 87.91% of 1026 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Marathon Oil's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Story continuesMarathon Oil (MRO)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Marathon Oil has been profitable for 6 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $6.70 billion and an EPS of $3.17. Its operating margin is 36.6%, which ranks better than 80.08% of 979 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Marathon Oil is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is one of the most crucial factors in a company's valuation. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Marathon Oil is 20.6%, which ranks better than 71.86% of 860 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 30.3%, which ranks better than 67.55% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.Comparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also evaluate profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Marathon Oil's ROIC was 10.67 while its WACC came in at 12.01.Marathon Oil (MRO)'s True Worth: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is estimated to be fairly valued.

In the latest one, Britain's media regulator asked the country's antitrust authority to investigate U.S. tech giants Amazon and Microsoft's dominance of the UK cloud market.Here are some of the actions taken by European watchdogs to keep a tab on big technology companies:EUROPEAN UNIONMicrosoft said in August it would unbundle chat and video app Teams from its Office product in a bid to avoid a possible EU antitrust fine, a month after the European Commission launched an investigation into its Office and Teams tie-up.Meta Platforms offered in July to curb the use of competitors' advertising data for its Facebook Marketplace online classified service in an attempt to settle an EU antitrust investigation but regulators rebuffed it, people familiar with the matter said.In May, Meta was hit with a record 1.2-billion euro ($1.27 billion) fine by the EU's lead privacy regulator for its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the United States.EU regulators said in June that Alphabet's Google may have to sell part of its adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices, threatening the company with its harshest regulatory penalty to date.The EU competition watchdog last year accused Apple of restricting rivals' access to its tap-and-go technology, NFC, used for mobile wallets, making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices. The regulators have since continued their investigation.In December 2022, Amazon settled three antitrust probes after it addressed the EU's concerns over its use of sellers' data.In September, the EU picked out 22 so-called ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of its wide-ranging Digital Markets Act (DMA).Story continuesBRITAINBritain's media regulator on Oct. 5 asked the country's antitrust authority CMA to investigate Amazon and Microsoft's dominance of the UK cloud market, citing features that made it more difficult for businesses to switch or mix and match cloud providers. CMA will complete its investigation by April 2025.FRANCEThe French competition authority raided Nvidia's local offices in the last week of September, the Wall Street Journal reported. The watchdog disclosed the raid on Sept. 27, but did not name the company beyond saying it was in the ""graphics cards sector"".Nvidia declined to comment.The antitrust authority in July said Apple may have violated regulations related to the utilisation of iPhone user data in advertising and could potentially misuse its dominant market position by imposing biased, unclear, and unfair conditions to handle user data.The country's privacy watchdog said in July it was aware of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin crypto project and that the legality of its biometric data collection ""seems questionable as do the conditions for storing biometric data"".GERMANYGoogle has agreed to change its user data practices to end a German antitrust investigation aimed at curbing its data-driven market power, the German cartel office said on Oct. 5. Google's commitments will give users more choice on how their data is used across the company's platforms, the regulator said.A German data watchdog has been investigating Worldcoin since late 2022. Worldcoin, which launched in July 2023, requires users to give their iris scans in exchange for a digital ID and, in some countries, free cryptocurrency.ITALYItaly's antitrust agency said in May it had opened a probe into Apple for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the apps market.In April, the watchdog took measures against Meta over an alleged abuse of its position in the country, in a probe involving the rights to music posted on the group's platforms.OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot was temporarily banned in Italy in March over concerns by the national data protection authority, but was made available to users again in April.The antitrust authority said in March it had opened an investigation into TikTok for allegedly breaching its rules by allowing the publication of ""dangerous content"" inciting suicide, self-harm and poor nutrition.NETHERLANDSThe Dutch competition regulator on Oct. 2 said it had rejected Apple's objections against fines of 50 million euros it had given the company over failure to comply with regulations aimed at limiting the dominant position of Apple's App Store. Apple will appeal the decision in Dutch courts.POLANDA Polish watchdog said in September it was investigating OpenAI over a complaint that ChatGPT breaks European Union data protection laws.Poland's competition and consumer protection authority in February accused Amazon's European arm of misleading sales and delivery practices.SPAINSpain's antitrust watchdog in July fined Amazon and Apple for colluding to limit the online sale of devices from Apple and competitors in the country.($1 = 0.9458 euros)(Reporting by Alessandro Parodi, Victor Goury-Laffont, Olivier Cherfan and Paolo Laudani in Gdansk; editing by Milla Nissi and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

Though costs associated with these innovations pose a threat to profits, the company’s justified pricing actions have been offering relief.Focus on Frozen and Snacks DivisionsConagra's innovation efforts have been concentrated on the frozen and snacks categories, both of which have shown remarkable growth over the past four years. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management stated that the frozen and snacks categories have improved 9% and 8%, respectively, over the past four years. Together, these categories form about 70% of the company’s domestic retail dollar sales.Growth in the frozen category reflects the strength of the company’s brands and the effective execution of the Conagra Way playbook. In the fourth quarter, Conagra saw an improved share in multi-serve meals, frozen sides and frozen breakfast sausages. During fiscal 2023 (a year of considerable pricing), seven out of the company’s top 10 frozen product categories either held or increased unit share.Moving to snacks, Conagra’s two biggest snacking platforms — meat snacks and microwave popcorn — witnessed increased unit share in fiscal 2023. Management expects fiscal 2024 results to benefit from the company’s investments in innovation in these categories.Cost Woes, an Industry ChallengeConagra faced cost inflation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The adjusted gross margin was adversely affected by the increased costs of goods sold, including unfavorable commodity positions, and an unfavorable operating leverage. Management anticipates the net cost of goods sold inflation of nearly 3% in fiscal 2024.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, excluding advertising and promotional costs, surged 24.3% to $301 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher incentive compensations and increased investments in the supply chain and technology. Advertising and promotional costs also increased substantially, reaching $69 million, up by 49.7% compared to the year-ago quarter. Management foresees continued investments in advertising and promotional activities and SG&amp;A in fiscal 2024 to support ongoing innovation efforts.Other players like McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, Sysco Corporation SYY and Flowers Foods, Inc. FLO have also been grappling with cost inflation.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, McCormick’s adjusted gross margin was somewhat offset by escalated cost inflation. Further, MKC’s SG&amp;A expenses increased year over year due to elevated employee incentive compensation expenses and increased distribution costs. McCormick also witnessed a spike in brand marketing costs in the second quarter and expects an even greater year-over-year rise in brand marketing costs in the third quarter.Sysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, SYY witnessed product cost inflation of 2.1% for the overall company, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the frozen, canned and dry categories. Apart from this, adjusted operating expenses rose 1.9%. Sysco anticipates its International segment to remain inflationary in fiscal 2024.Flowers Foods continued to be impacted by input cost inflation, reduced production volumes, higher product returns and elevated maintenance costs in the second quarter of 2023. FLO expects inflation to persist in 2024. Additionally, FLO witnessed a rise in marketing expenses in the second quarter of 2023. The company’s adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative expenses expanded 70 basis points to 38.2% of sales. Flowers Foods’ increased focus on marketing and innovation behind brands is likely to increase its cost burden in the near term.Story continuesPricing Offers Respite to ConagraConagra has successfully navigated cost challenges through its pricing initiatives. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed a 9.9% improvement in the price/mix, which contributed to 2.2% growth in organic sales. This was attributed to Conagra's strategic pricing actions in response to inflation.Across various segments, the price/mix exhibited strong growth, with increases of 9.1%, 10.4%, 13.8% and 9.3% in the Grocery &amp; Snacks, Refrigerated &amp; Frozen, International and Foodservice sectors, respectively. The continuation of these strategies is expected to benefit Conagra going forward, with fiscal 2024 organic net sales projected to rise around 1% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.86 billion, up 14.74% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.54 per share and revenue of $7.17 billion. These totals would mark changes of +37.5% and +13.66%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Monster Beverage should also be noted by investors.

Also, product launches and innovation, as well as pricing actions, bode well.Pricing increases, along with lower freight-in costs and reduced aluminum can costs, contributed to the company’s margins in second-quarter 2023. The gross margin expanded 540 basis points (bps) year over year to 52.5%, beating our estimate of 47.3%. Operating income of $523.8 million rose 40% year over year and beat our estimate of $429.2 million. The upside was driven by an increased gross margin. The operating margin expanded 570 bps year over year to 28.2% in the reported quarter, which surpassed our estimate of 23.3%.Strength in its energy drinks category acts as a key growth driver. In second-quarter 2023, the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales increased 9.7% year over year to $1.7 billion and met our estimate. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 12%.The company is committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In second-quarter 2023, it launched many products and expanded distribution in the international markets. In the quarter, it continued with the roll-out of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed, in the United States and received positive feedback.Consequently, MNST is on track with the expansion of the distribution of The Beast Unleashed into additional markets, with nationwide distribution plans by the end of the year.Monster Beverages continued to implement price hikes in the second quarter of 2023, with additional price hikes planned in a number of other markets through the remainder of the year. In some markets, this rise was in addition to price increases implemented in 2022. In the United States, management implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 oz and 24 oz energy drinks, effective Apr 1, 2023.These factors led to year-over-year sales growth of 12% on a reported basis and 14.4% on a currency-adjusted basis in second-quarter 2023. Sales to customers outside the United States rose 10%, representing about 39% of the total net sales. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to customers outside the United States improved 16%.However, it has been witnessing rising costs due to increased payroll expenses.  The cost of sales was $880.7 million, up 0.6% year over year. Operating expenses grew 10.7% year over year to $450.4 million and surpassed our estimate of $443.7 million. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, expanded 20 bps year over year to 9.3%. The company has also been witnessing supply-chain headwinds.Similarly, other Consumer-Staples stocks, including AB InBev BUD, The Clorox Company CLX and Constellation Brands STZ, have been witnessing rising costs and supply-chain challenges.AB InBev continued to witness higher costs and soft margin trends in second-quarter 2023. The cost of sales increased 3.3% on a reported basis and 9.2% on an organic basis to $7,019 million in the second quarter.SG&amp;A expenses increased 9.4% on an organic basis due to elevated supply-chain costs. Also, commodity cost headwinds, and increased sales and marketing investments are concerning.Clorox’s selling and administrative expenses rose 35% year over year to $329 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. The metric, as a percentage of sales, expanded 280 bps from the prior-year figure at 16.3%, attributable to investments to enhance digital capabilities.Going into fiscal 2024, CLX expects selling and administrative expenses to be 15-16% of sales, including 1.5 points of impact from its strategic investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. Clorox anticipates advertising and sales promotion spending to be 11% of sales, driven by its commitment to investing in its brand portfolio. For fiscal 2024, management earlier expected a supply-chain inflation of $200 million.Constellation Brands has been witnessing higher packaging and raw material costs stemming from continued inflationary pressures. Moving on, higher overhead costs related to its brewery expansion, as well as increased logistics costs related to higher shipment volumes, act as deterrents.As a result, COGS rose 13.4% year over year to $1,257.1 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2024, the company expects higher packaging and raw materials, freight and overhead costs.Story continuesConclusionMonster Beverages appears well-placed for growth despite rising costs, driven by the introduction of innovative products across the Monster family to meet consumers’ needs, and strength in its energy drinks category.The PEG ratio for MNST is just 1.50, a level far lower than the industry average of 2.39. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that considers the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, MNST is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $7.2 billion and $1.54, suggesting respective growth of 13.7% and 37.5% from the year-ago reported figures.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:LUV) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 80% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-co-nyse-luv-175548350.html,1696269348,STORY,['LUV'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Southwest Airlines' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 11 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Southwest Airlines. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southwest Airlines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Southwest Airlines. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Southwest Airlines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Southwest Airlines. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 7.4% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 11 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Southwest AirlinesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Southwest Airlines Co. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$60m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Southwest Airlines. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Southwest Airlines  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NYSE:PM) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.6bUS$11.2bUS$11.5bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.4bUS$13.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.30%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.5kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.9kUS$7.6kUS$7.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$87bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$317bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$317b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$168bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$255b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$91.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.884. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Philip Morris International, we've put together three essential items you should further research:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Philip Morris International we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does PM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Of course you do — and rightly so!In a recent study conducted by Mike Wilson, Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley, the analysis focused on the performance of dividend-paying stocks compared to non-dividend-paying stocks since the year 2000. The historical data underscores a compelling trend: dividend-paying stocks consistently outperform non-dividend stocks over the medium to long term.That outperformance has even been more pronounced in times of uncertainty and market retreats. “Specifically,” Wilson noted, “the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020.”With uncertainty currently prevailing, Wilson believes it might be the right time to seriously consider loading up on these classic defensive plays.Against this backdrop, the analysts at Morgan Stanley have pinpointed an opportunity in a pair of dividend stocks with enticing attributes: a high dividend yield to outpace the current inflation rate, an attractive valuation, and the potential for future share price growth.In fact, it’s not only Morgan Stanley who favors these names. Using the TipRanks database, we found that both are also rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look.Philip Morris International (PM)We’ll start with one of the best-known names in the ‘sin sector,’ Philip Morris International. This is a leader in the tobacco industry, and the owner, with full production and marketing rights, of the Marlboro cigarette brand’s international footprint. Some of the company’s other brand names include L&amp;M, Chesterfield, and Next, along with – you guessed it – Philip Morris. The company has a presence in over 175 global markets, and can boast that, in most of them, it holds the first- or second-place market share for cigarettes and other tobacco products.Those leading market shares are solid assets, because even with the growing social pressures against smoking, the tobacco industry totaled some $867 billion in 2022 – and by the end of this decade, the industry is expected to hit a value of $1.05 trillion.Story continuesOne of the chief effects of anti-smoking pressure, be they social or political, has been to push Philip Morris toward increased diversification of its product lines. The company is a leader not just in cigarettes but also in the expanding market for smokeless tobacco products. Over the past few years, PM has invested over $10.5 billion into such products, and the company has seen smokeless non-nicotine products increase their share of total revenue from 29.1% in 2021 to nearly 35% in 2022. The company is targeting 50% of revenues from smoke-free products by 2025. PM’s portfolio of smokeless products includes the growing line of iQOS heated tobacco products, multiple e-vape products, and a range of oral smokeless tobaccos.Philip Morris will release its financial results for 3Q23 later this month, but we can look back at Q2 and get an idea of just where the company stands. The second quarter top-line came in at a hair under $9 billion, growing 14.5% year-over-year and beating the forecast by more than $259 million. The firm’s bottom line figure, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.60, was 12 cents per share better than had been anticipated.Looking ahead, the Street expects to see revenues of $9.31 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.61 when PM releases its Q3 results on October 19.Rising revenues and earnings are supporting a solid dividend, which PM raised in its last declaration. The announcement, on Sept 13, set the common share quarterly dividend at $1.30 per share, for a 2.4% increase from the previous payout. The annualized rate of $5.20 gives a yield of 5.6%, well above the last reported annualized inflation rate, of 3.67% in August.Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, analyst Pamela Kaufman focuses on the company’s shift from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco as the key point for investors to consider going forward. She writes, “PM is our Top Pick as its peer-leading growth outlook is supported by its successful transition to smoke-free products and reflects: 1) accelerating HTU (heated tobacco units) share from IQOS ILUMA rollout; 2) continued rapid Zyn growth in the US; 3) a large and attractive US growth opportunity for IQOS with moderate investment needs; and 4) opportunity for EBIT margin expansion. We believe valuation at 11x 2024 EV/EBITDA is attractive.”Kaufman’s bullish stance supports her Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, while her $113 price target indicates her confidence in ~24% one-year upside potential for the shares. Adding in the dividend, and the total return on this stock is ~29% for the year ahead. (To watch Kaufman’s track record, click here)Overall, all 6 of the recent analyst reviews on this tobacco company are positive, making for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. PM shares are priced at $91.41, and their $113 average price target implies ~24% upside heading out to the one-year horizon. (See PM stock forecast)Bridge Investment Group (BRDG)Next up, Bridge Investment Group, is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, a class of companies long known as ‘dividend champs.’ Bridge is a vertically integrated real estate manager, and its portfolio contains a wide range of financial instruments and properties. These include real-estate-backed credit, along with residential properties, offices spaces, logistics properties, and industrial-use net leased real estate.Not only is Bridge’s portfolio diverse in its broad categories, but the company also works hard to develop diversified holdings within each category. The logistic properties, for example, include warehouses and transport hubs, and the company’s developments include EV charging, LED lighting, and solar power installations whenever feasible. Bridge’s residential properties include single-family rentals, senior housing, and multi-family apartments. And in the credit space, Bridge uses a variety of strategies to assemble a diverse set of MBS assets.At the bottom line, all of this added up to distributable earnings of 20 cents per share in the company’s 2Q23 financial release, based on a net total of $35 million. This was in-line with expectations. Dividend investors should note that Bridge has a history of adjusting its payout to keep it in-line with distributable earnings. The current dividend, of 17 cents per share, annualizes to 68 cents per common share, and gives a yield of 7.4%, more than enough to ensure a real rate of return in today’s environment.This company’s dividend is attractive, but Morgan Stanley’s Michael Cyprys takes a closer look at Bridge’s exposure to commercial real estate (CRE). This is a serious concern, as CRE is flashing danger signs in multiple important urban areas, but Cyprys sees reason to believe that Bridge can weather this storm and continue to deliver returns to investors. He writes, “Private markets real estate manager trading at depressed valuation due to blanket negativity that stems from rising CRE risks around debt refi and valuations. We think the market should be more discerning given BRDG has limited principal &amp; redemption risk and instead earns fees on locked-up, committed 3rd party capital. While growth slows near-term (slower fundraising and transactional activity), we still expect mid-teens growth in assets and FRE. Fed pause could catalyze pickup in activity later in ’23/into ’24, particularly if rates volatility is dampened.”These comments back up Cyprys’ Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock with his $15 price target suggesting a gain of ~66% in the year ahead. (To watch Cyprys’ track record, click here)Overall, this stock gets a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 5 reviews that include 4 to Buy and 1 to Hold. Shares are trading for $9.01 with an average target price of $14.30 to imply ~59% one-year upside potential.

The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target TGT, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.Eric Bunyan, the senior vice president of Leasing, East Region, for Macerich, emphasized the significance of these developments. He stated, “The tremendous success of the new Target at Kings Plaza, combined with strong performance for Primark, Zara and Burlington, each of which have been open since 2018 in the former Sears location, demonstrates the power and promise of Kings Plaza, Macerich’s well-located, fully enclosed retail center in Brooklyn.”Bunyan's enthusiasm is well-founded as these national brands selecting Kings Plaza underscore its appeal to diverse demographics, including affluent shoppers from the dynamic trade area.Macerich's approach to leasing, which focuses on creating properties that cater to a broader range of consumer needs, has proven effective. The addition of popular brands like Shake Shack and Ashley Furniture further enhances the shopping experience. Moreover, Macerich is exploring opportunities for a 50,000-square-foot location at the prime corner of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Recent improvements, such as brightening and lightening the attached parking deck, along with upgrades to lighting, furnishings and flooring on the center's second level, have further solidified Kings Plaza as one of the most successful shopping centers in the market.Kings Plaza, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and dining destination with a 10-level parking garage, has an impressive lineup of tenants, including Target, Primark, Zara, Burlington, Lowe's, Ashley Furniture, Sephora and many others. This diverse mix of retailers caters to a wide range of consumer preferences, making Kings Plaza a go-to destination for shopping and dining.Nevertheless, dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

89,4deb166e-0277-3873-98c4-bde991d8bf4b,PPG,2023-10-03,Should You Be Adding PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-ppg-industries-nyse-ppg-150028834.html,1696258828,STORY,['PPG'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide PPG Industries with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries How Fast Is PPG Industries Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years PPG Industries grew its EPS by 9.8% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. This approach makes PPG Industries look pretty good, on balance; although revenue is flattish, EBIT margins improved from 9.2% to 12% in the last year. Which is a great look for the company.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of PPG Industries' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre PPG Industries Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of PPG Industries, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$56m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like PPG Industries, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.PPG Industries' CEO took home a total compensation package of US$2.9m in the year prior to December 2022. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add PPG Industries To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, PPG Industries is a growing business, which is encouraging. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for PPG Industries, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for PPG Industries that you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

PPG recently collaborated with the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands to develop the Stella Terra, which is anticipated to be the world's first off-road car powered by solar energy, making it independent of charging stations and paved roads.PPG, which is among the prominent players in the chemical space along with Dow Inc. DOW, Eastman Chemical Company EMN and Celanese Corporation CE, is donating $37,000 to the Solar Team Eindhoven as part of its recent $5 million commitment to environmental sustainability education. PPG CoraChar fire protection coating is also being supplied by the company to protect the vehicle's lithium (Li)-ion battery pack. The Stella Terra has been engineered to resist the rigors of off-roading, and the crew will depart for Morocco in October to do extensive testing, including in the Sahara desert.PPG CoraChar battery fire protection coatings are intumescent, which means they expand in the presence of strong heat or fire to form an insulating layer that protects against thermal damage. PPG's knowledge of industrial and commercial fire protection is leveraged in the coatings, which improve light-weighting, increase battery performance and support passenger and first-responder safety in the event of a fire.The project contributes to PPG's goals of producing environmentally friendly solutions and promoting sustainability education. It intends to use this investment to support educational programs relating to sustainable energy and the future of mobility, as well as to train the next generation of leaders to comprehend the effects of climate change.The company, on its second-quarter call, said that it expects third-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, PPG raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.Another prominent chemical maker, Dow, delivered forecast-topping earnings performance in the second quarter. DOW’s EPS of 75 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. The company expects net sales in the band of $10.25-$10.75 billion for the third quarter.Eastman Chemical’s second-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.99 also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95. It expects EPS for 2023 to be between $6.50 and $7.00. Furthermore, EMN expects to deliver $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in 2023.Celanese, however, missed earnings estimates in the second quarter. Its adjusted earnings of $2.17 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46. Celanese sees adjusted earnings in the range of $2-$2.50 per share for the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Ensuring that a storage site is both safer and economical is crucial for the speed, scale and investment needed to meaningfully drive CCUS growth for a low carbon energy ecosystem.""The screening and ranking solution uses both technical and nontechnical data to provide a detailed assessment of the capacity and economic viability of storage sites, while identifying potential risks. A benchmark comparison, pulling from successful storage projects globally, is created to provide a relative basis for ranking each site.SLB uses proprietary tools, augmented by advanced digitally enabled workflows, to provide a fast, traceable and consistent process to validate the data, with an emphasis on risk identification using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.In Trinidad and Tobago, SLB collaborated with a customer to screen and rank potential storage sites, ahead of a scheduled offshore exploration and production and carbon storage licensing round. SLB evaluated storage sites in three geographic provinces, using 67 key criteria from SLB's proprietary workflow to evaluate potential sites. It then performed a sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of varied attributes and site properties on the ranking outcomes. The sites’ performance was benchmarked against the attributes of carbon storage basins in the United States and Europe.Story continuesUsing Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate more than 2,000 iterations, SLB ranked the sites for the customer from best to worst. The process empowered the customer to prioritize areas with prime subsurface and surface characteristics, as well as high grading zones for more detailed evaluation and investment.Today’s announcement was made as part of ADIPEC, an international platform uniting industry to accelerate urgent, collective and responsible action to decarbonize quicker and future-proof our energy system, taking place in Abu Dhabi through October 5.For more information about the carbon storage and ranking solution, visit slb.com/carbon-storage-screening-ranking.About SLBSLB (NYSE: SLB) is a global technology company that drives energy innovation for a balanced planet. With a global footprint in more than 100 countries and employees representing almost twice as many nationalities, we work each day on innovating oil and gas, delivering digital at scale, decarbonizing industries, and developing and scaling new energy systems that accelerate the energy transition.

The streaming giant is selling action figures and apparel inspired by a new show based on a popular Japanese manga called One Piece.The move breaks new ground for the company, which has sold merchandise for its shows in the past, including Stranger Things, Sex Education, and The Witcher, but only after they had proven themselves successful. Here, Netflix put all its eggs in its One Piece basket before it knew whether the show would be a hit.This is the company’s latest effort to wring more dollars from its subscribers, from raising subscription prices and cracking down on password-sharing, to hosting Bridgerton-themed balls and Squid Game virtual reality experiences.One Piece tells the story of a young pirate who sets off on an adventure to find the ultimate treasure known as the “One Piece.” The series is wildly popular: More than 516 million copies of the manga have been sold worldwide since it was released in July 1997, and last year, One Piece Film: Red, an animated movie adaptation of the manga, hit No. 1 in the Japanese box office, outperforming blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick by over 6 billion yen (or over $40 million).The new live-action adaptation made its Netflix debut on August 31, and it's already a huge success. But Netflix took a gamble by creating merchandise months before it knew whether fans would even like the show.“It’s a way for us to continue a conversation with a fan base that’s really into a show, that really wants to purchase something to show their love for characters,” Marian Lee, Netflix’s chief marketing officer, told the Wall Street Journal.What Wednesday Addams taught NetflixAfter sunsetting its DVD mailing system on Friday—the company’s original business, started 25 years ago, that was eventually overshadowed by the streaming boom—Netflix is looking for other ways to wring every last dollar out of its customers. Since May, Netflix has successfully cracked down on sharing account passwords. And in July, it raised its monthly subscription prices and eliminated its cheapest ad-free subscription tier.Story continuesUtilizing merchandise and experiences to keep fans engaged between seasons of shows is a relatively new strategy for the company. It indicates Netflix is taking a page from the book of its new streaming competitor, Disney, whose popular theme parks and cruises that bring its content to life and create revenue streams outside box-office results. Before it started producing its own pipeline of original shows and movies, Netflix lacked the rights to sell show-inspired products as it licensed other studios’ content for years.Just look at what happened with Jenna Ortega’s goth-inspired dance to The Cramps’ “Goo Goo Muck” in Wednesday: The scene went viral as people recreated the dance on social media and the tag #wednesdaydance amassed over 2.3 billion views on TikTok. But Netflix didn’t own the merchandising rights to the show, the Wall Street Journal reported, so fans of the Tim Burton show instead bought unofficial merchandise inspired by the Addams Family character from third-party retailers. Netflix has since partnered with MGM, the studio that owns the intellectual property rights to the franchise, on goods, according to the Journal.But now that Netflix has original hits on its hands, the company has been building out its array of experiences. For example, the events series The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience invites fans of the romance hit to dress up and attend a Regency-era-inspired ball. Similarly, Netflix created a virtual reality experience mimicking the Korean survival drama Squid Game. Since 2021, over four million people have attended Netflix’s various pop-up events, the Journal reported.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

(WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.Prior to Monday's meeting, SAG AFTRA and the AMPTP had not held official talks since the strike first began.📢 Rise and shine #SagAftraMembers! As we return to negotiations, remember that our fight isn't over. Join us on the picket lines or at an event near you TODAY and let's keep pushing until we win what we deserve! 🎭💫 #SagAftraStrong pic.twitter.com/e5PBTfEhC2— SAG-AFTRA (@sagaftra) October 2, 2023The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Story continuesIndustry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Wage increases will be a likely sticking point as the union is currently demanding an 11% general wage increase in year one, a 4% increase in year two, and another 4% boost in year three.To compare, the WGA achieved a 5% wage increase this year followed by a 4% jump in 2024 and a 3.5% boost in 2025.SAG-AFTRA member John Schmitt, second from right, and others carry signs on the picket line outside Netflix on Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2023, in Los Angeles. Hollywood's writers strike was declared over Tuesday night when board members from the union approved a contract agreement with studios, bringing the industry at least partly back from a historic halt in production. The actors strike continues in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Chris Pizzello/AP Photo) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE:TJX). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$93.59 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$81.72. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether TJX Companies' current trading price of US$88.68 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TJX Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies What's The Opportunity In TJX Companies?According to my valuation model, TJX Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TJX Companies today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $99.65, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, TJX Companies’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.Can we expect growth from TJX Companies?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TJX Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TJX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TJX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

For the fiscal year, it expects overall comparable store sales growth of 3-4%, excluding sales from the 53rd week. The consolidated sales are envisioned in the band of $53.5-$53.8 billion, suggesting 7-8% year-over-year growth. For the third quarter, comparable store sales are expected to rise by 3-4% and consolidated sales are expected to increase by 6-7% to $12.9-$13.1 billion.With the growing popularity of online shopping among consumers, The TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. In 2022, the company added several new categories and brands to all its online banners. It also plans to add nearly 125 net new stores in fiscal 2024, taking its year-end total to roughly 5,000 stores.TJX believes in rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. In the fiscal second quarter, it repurchased shares worth $550 million and paid out dividends of $382 million. The company plans to repurchase shares worth $2-$2.5 billion in fiscal 2024.Despite the positives, TJX has been grappling with high costs and operating expenses. For instance, in the fiscal second quarter, its cost of sales increased by 4% and selling, general and administrative expenses rose by 17.7%. In the fiscal first quarter, its cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.8% and 6.9%, respectively. The company expects high wage and supply-chain costs to remain hurdles in fiscal 2024.Its high debt profile also remains a concern. Exiting second-quarter fiscal 2024, its long-term debt (including long-term operating lease liabilities) was nearly $11 billion. The metric reflects an increase from $10.7 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2024. An increase in debt levels can raise its financial obligations and hurt profitability.Given its extensive presence across international markets, TJX is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations. Incidentally, foreign currency movements had a 1 percentage point adverse impact on net sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.The TJX Companies also operates in the highly competitive retail apparel and home fashion industry. The company, which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry faces stiff competition from several competitors like Target Corporation TGT, Ross Stores, Inc.

""The choice between doing so and weathering the ... massive fines and taxes is no choice at all""At least seven of the drugmakers have sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Medicare agency, calling the process unconstitutional price setting.On Friday, a federal judge rejected an attempt by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to block the program in a lawsuit. Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk filed its own lawsuit on Friday in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.The U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), did not immediately comment.CMS chose the drugs based on certain criteria set out by Medicare. They must be sold in pharmacies, not have substantial generic competition, and have been on the market for at least nine years - 13 for more complex biotech drugs.The drugs involved in the first round of price talks are: blood thinner Eliquis from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer; Merck &amp; Co's diabetes drug Januvia; Eliquis rival Xarelto as well as arthritis and Crohn's disease medicine Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson; AbbVie's leukemia treatment Imbruvica; Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel; Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance; and insulin from Novo Nordisk.Story continuesOnly the nine primary manufacturers of the 10 drugs were required to sign off on the deal with CMS.The new prices, which will be required to be at least 25% lower than their current list, would take effect in 2026. The program aims to save $25 billion per year on drug prices by 2031.The companies will have a chance to meet with CMS later this autumn and the regulator will send them a proposal for its ""maximum fair price"" for the drugs by Feb. 1, 2024.Keep up with the latest medical breakthroughs and healthcare trends with our newsletter Reuters Health Rounds.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 6/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 4/10GF Value rank: 8/10Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Newmont Corp the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Newmont Corp's BusinessNewmont Corp, with a market cap of $28.27 billion, is the world's largest gold miner, producing about 6 million attributable ounces of gold in 2022, good for about 5% of global mined output. The company also produced 1.3 million attributable gold equivalent ounces from the sale of byproducts, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead in 2022. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at end 2022.

Over the past five years, Newmont Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -28.4, while the five-year growth rate is at -5.9. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, Newmont Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of Newmont Corp (NEM): A Deep Dive into Its GF ScoreConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Newmont Corp has a rich history and significant market presence, its current financial and growth indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Callon Petroleum How Fast Is Callon Petroleum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, Callon Petroleum has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Callon Petroleum's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$13.16 to US$15.07. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 14% gain.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Despite consistency in EBIT margins year on year, Callon Petroleum has actually recorded a dip in revenue. This does not bode too well for short term growth prospects and so understanding the reasons for these results is of great importance.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Callon Petroleum?Story continuesAre Callon Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.The good news is that Callon Petroleum insiders spent a whopping US$2.1m on stock in just one year, without so much as a single sale. Knowing this, Callon Petroleum will have have all eyes on them in anticipation for the what could happen in the near future. We also note that it was the Independent Director, Steven Webster, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$1.5m for shares at about US$31.63 each.Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Callon Petroleum is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. To be specific, they have US$46m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 1.7% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Shareholders have more to smile about than just insiders adding more shares to their already sizeable holdings. The cherry on top is that the CEO, Joe Gatto is paid comparatively modestly to CEOs at similar sized companies. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Callon Petroleum with market caps between US$2.0b and US$6.4b is about US$6.8m.Callon Petroleum offered total compensation worth US$4.2m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Callon Petroleum Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Callon Petroleum is that it is growing profits. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 3 warning signs for Callon Petroleum (1 is concerning!) that you need to be mindful of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of Callon Petroleum, you'll probably love this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Even though The Institute for Supply Management's factory index remains in contractionary territory overall - the longest stretch since the 2007-2009 Great Recession - activity is clearly building again.The good news for inflation worriers is that the prices paid by those businesses fell by more than 5 points during the month.What's more, the recent spike in crude oil prices appears to be going into reverse again.Ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Wednesday, crude oil prices fell back to their lowest in three weeks - dipping back below $88 per barrel and dragging year-on-year gains down to just 5%.Story continuesBut in another pivotal week for U.S. labor data culminating in the September employment report on Friday, attention will flip to August job openings numbers later on Tuesday for clues about the ongoing tightness of the jobs market - central to the Fed's deliberations.Fed hawkishness, however, has kept futures markets pricing a 50-50 chance of another quarter point rate hike to the 5.50-5.75% range by year-end.Whether the weekend's stopgap measure to keep U.S. government open until Nov. 17 just builds more uncertainty into that year-end period leaves markets on edge entering the final quarter.Rising 10-year nominal and real yields grind on regardless - as the Fed view combines with a rethink of a more high pressured economy longer-term as well as negative market dynamics and positioning.A so-called 'bear steepening' of the 2-10 year yield curve to its least inverted in five months is an aggravator for bond funds, as is hedge fund activity that sees these speculators reluctant to cover huge short positions in Treasury futures.Bond volatility captured by the MOVE index hit its highest in almost six weeks on Monday.The dollar continues to be the big beneficiary - hitting its highest level of the year against the euro and only balking at a one-year high at 150 yen due to wariness of Bank of Japan intervention.The Australian dollar skidded to its lowest level of the year after the Reserve Bank of Australia left its key policy rate unchanged at 4.10% overnight.For U.S. stocks, the picture is harder to parse - as investors juggle the better U.S. growth projections with the higher-for-longer rate squeeze.As the third-quarter earnings season hoves into view this month, the S&amp;P500 held the line on Monday despite climbing long-term borrowing rates and Big Tech stocks, typically most sensitive to interest rates, outperformed.And futures were a smidgen higher again ahead of Tuesday's bell.In company news, Birkenstock - the German premium footwear brand backed by private-equity firm L Catterton - targeted a fully diluted valuation of about $10 billion in its highly anticipated U.S. initial public offering, according to filings.And British online fashion retailer Boohoo dropped 10% after it said revenue fell 17% in the six months to August and warned of a similar decline for the full year.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:* US Aug job openings data* Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic speaks* U.S. Treasury auctions 12-month bills* U.S. corporate earnings: McCormick(Reporting by Mike Dolan; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the sports betting market, you can go directly to 5 States Where Sports Betting Is Legal.In one of our previous articles about the biggest gambling cities, we mentioned that the US has the most casinos in the world. The gambling market contributes greatly to the economy every year while also creating jobs across the country.Similarly, the sports betting market can have a positive impact on the economy. According to a study by Williams Honors College at The University of Akron, legalizing sports gambling online can boost the real GDP per capita of a state in the US by $1,073.28. Where sports gambling is legalized fully, online and retail, the GDP per capita of a state can grow by an average of $2,845.88.The sports betting market is thriving and expected to reach new highs in the coming years. Before we take a look at 24 states where sports betting is legal, let’s take a look at the sports betting market and what some of the key market players are up to.The Global Sports Betting Market: A Bright OutlookAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global sports betting market was valued at $83.65 billion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3% during 2023-2030, and reach a value of around $182 billion by the end of the forecast period. The growing popularity of smartphones and internet services, and the evolving regulatory landscape of gambling markets around the world, all contribute to the increased demand for sports betting. Improvements in AI as well as technological advancements that enhance the prediction algorithms in betting apps and software are expected to further augment market growth. The online segment of the sports betting market is projected to experience explosive growth in the coming years.Moreover, the growing number of sporting events, leagues, and competitions around the world such as FIFA World Cup, NFL, UEFA Europa Conference League, and UEFA Champions League, among others, are expected to positively influence market growth during the forecast period. On August 16, Reuters reported that with a record number of women globally placing bets, British bookmakers have reported a significant surge in bets on the Women's World Cup, compared to previous years. Britain's William Hill, now a subsidiary of 888 Holdings plc (LON:888), said it had already taken 900,000 bets on the Women’s World Cup, the pinnacle of women's soccer which was then being hosted by Australia and New Zealand. While the US is the most successful nation in Women's World Cup history, Spain went on to win the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, beating England 1-0 in the final.Story continuesHowever, strict rules governing sports betting in different regions can hamper market growth. The regulation of sports betting varies from country to country, and state to state in the US. On August 11, Reuters reported that Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) announced that they are closing up WynnBET, its online sports betting and iGaming platform, in a number of states in the US due to a lack of transparency in the regulatory environment and rising costs to attract new customers. WynnBET operations are closing in eight US states, including West Virginia, where it launched just a few months ago. Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) ranks among the biggest betting companies in the world, and develops and operates high-end hotels and casinos.A Look at Some of the Other Biggest Companies in the Sports Betting MarketMarket players are looking to increase their market presence and utilize the increased number of sporting events around the world to boost their revenues. On June 16, CNBC reported that a major sports betting company, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), made an all-cash offer worth $195 million for the Australian company Pointsbet Holdings Ltd’s (ASX:PBH) US assets, topping an earlier bid of $150 million by Fanatics. However, as DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a major sports betting company in the US with a huge market share, the report mentions that regulatory challenges could get in the way of the deal. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) CEO Jason Robins said:“While we continue to focus on operating more efficiently and driving substantial organic revenue growth in the United States, we will also look to prudently capitalize on compelling opportunities at attractive valuations, as is the case with PointsBet’s U.S. business.”On June 13, Reuters reported that Entain Plc (LON:ENT) announced that it will be acquiring STS Holding S.A. (WSE:STH), a Poland-based sports betting operator, for around $946 million in an effort to increase their business in Europe. Entain Plc (LON:ENT) is an international sports betting and gambling company that has been rapidly expanding in Europe through acquisitions. Currently, Entain Plc (LON:ENT) owns the Coral chain of betting shops in the UK as well as brands like Ladbrokes, bwin, PartyPoker, and Sportingbet, among other subsidiaries.In other news, The Walt Disney Company’s (NYSE:DIS) ESPN and the casino gambling company Penn Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) have joined forces to establish a sports betting business under the name of ESPN Bet, as reported by Reuters on August 8. Under the agreement, Penn Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) will make a cash payment of $1.5 billion as well as offer about $500 million worth of warrants to ESPN. Penn Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) will rebrand its sportsbook service across 16 US states, where it has licenses, and relaunch it as ESPN Bet.On August 9, Penn Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.48, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.01. The company reported a revenue of $1.67 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $11.47 million.Now that we have looked at what some of the major players in the global sports betting market are up to, let’s take a look at 24 states where sports betting is legal.24 States Where Sports Betting Is LegalREDPIXEL.PL/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn this article, we have listed 24 states where sports betting is legal.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.NRG Energy in FocusNRG Energy (NRG) is headquartered in Houston, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 21.06% since the start of the year. The power company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.38 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.92%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.74% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.51 is up 7.9% from last year. Over the last 5 years, NRG Energy has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 88.27%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. NRG's current payout ratio is 39%. This means it paid out 39% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.NRG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.51 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 72.14%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, NRG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a filing, the credit card issuer disclosed agreeing to improve its customer compliance and related corporate governance. I believe at one point it was the best performer in the S&amp;P 500, although gave up some of those gains at day's end. So basically, this is a consent decree with the FDIC in order to improve some of its customer and consumer interactions. According to analysts, they were concerned that there would be a more onerous remedy here in this case, and so that's why we're seeing a bit of a relief being expressed in the shares.- Yeah, exactly. So analysts apparently seeing it as a positive. No fines or penalties. In other words, regulatory overhang lifting here. For example, Wolfe Research saying, no smoking gun. I think that pretty much sums up a lot of the feelings from the traders and investors today.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, back in July when the company said that this whole back and forth was going on with the FDIC, a couple of other things were weighing on the stock. It said basically that it had done a review after some incorrectly classified credit card accounts from around mid 2007. That was unrelated to the FDIC decree, but still, that was something weighing on the shares. At the same time, it also paused its share repurchases, so we'll see if we get a restart now that this portion has been resolved.Story continues- And moving on, Gamestop shares remain under pressure, sliding in today's trading session, hitting its lowest level this year. Company last week, remember, named Ryan Cohen as CEO amid the company's turnaround push, and you remember, Julie, I think we discussed some analysts, including our friend Michael Pachter of Wedbush, not fans of that move.JULIE HYMAN: No, not fans of the move, but it looks like shareholders, interestingly, are not necessarily fans of that move either, and this is a switch, right? For the period of time in which Gamestop could sort of do no wrong, no matter what, you know, people outside the company might have been saying about it, and that has definitely changed and sentiment has indeed soured on Gamestop.It's interesting that, you know, the sort of slip in the company. I think it's probably a coincidence, but the release of ""Dumb Money"", the movie that sort of examined the-- right, the the meme stock-- meme stock craze coincides with this drop in the shares of Gamestop. Maybe people taking another look at the stock. Who knows, as we see this switch over.- $15, by the way. $15. At one point, $4.80.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I remember.- You remember those days.JULIE HYMAN: I do remember those days. It wasn't that long ago, interestingly. There's the longer term chart. And let's take a look at NextEra Energy Partners. It's hit with a downgrade over at Wells Fargo. The stock cut to equal weight from overweight. The bank also slashing its price target. Shares of parent company NextEra Energy also sliding in today's trading session.Now, I think this is a really interesting story, because last week, NextEra, the parent company, cut its targets, got a bunch of downgrades. This is just the latest six day that we've seen declines for these companies here, and basically NextEra Energy cut the growth goal for NextEra Energy Partners, and that's what started this whole slide here. The worst performer, NextEra Energy that is, in the S&amp;P 500 on the day.- Yeah, and I think you'd be-- you know, the broader question are these higher interest rates as they begin to pose these headwinds, these challenges for the wind stocks, right, the solar stocks, the clean energy stocks. You begin as a trader, investor to wonder, OK, where's the next shoe dropping?JULIE HYMAN: Well, and it's not just the renewable energy stocks. It's the traditional utility companies as well. If you take a look inside the Yahoo Finance Interactive, looking at the sectors on the day, utilities, in part led by NextEra, down the most in the S&amp;P 500. Energy stocks as well, but the XLU, that's that ETF that tracks those, down by more than 4.5%.And traditionally there are a number of reasons that higher interest rates weigh on power companies. They tend to have high debt loads, right? And so they're paying higher energy servicing costs. They also have relatively high dividend yields, and so when energy-- when treasury yields creep up and up and up, that provides some competition. If I can buy a treasury, that's seen as a very safe return versus a utility. You know, you see some yield competition in that case.- Might not be the last headline we see like this.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We'll have to keep an eye on it. XLU down 11% over the past five sessions.- Wow.]"

133,2983f372-9dc4-3053-86a8-d7fd737cc3c1,MAS,2023-10-03,Ticking Time Bombs: 3 Homebuilder Stocks to Dump Before the Damage Is Done,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ticking-time-bombs-3-homebuilder-100259246.html,1695808979,STORY,"['DHI', 'MAS', 'TOL']","[The housing market is in a tricky spot right now. Higher interest rates are causing problems and distortions in the market. With the average interest rate charged on a home mortgage in the U.S. now above 7%, existing home sales have all but collapsed. However, new home construction is booming right now, having risen more than 20% in June of this year from the same month in 2022.  This is because existing homeowners are reluctant to sell and give up the locked-in interest rate on their house that is much lower than current rates. That sounds like good news for homebuilder stocks right?But will the boom in new home construction last? There are growing concerns that interest rates staying higher for longer will push the U.S. economy into a recession, dragging both the residential and commercial real estate markets down with it. Here are some homebuilder stocks that are ticking time bombs. Its time to dump them from your portfolio before the damage is done.Toll Brothers (TOL)Toll Brothers Home construction company logo seen displayed on smart phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThere’s a couple of reasons to proceed with caution regarding Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). First of all, the company both builds and arranges the financing of residential and commercial properties in the U.S. It’s wide exposure across the entire home building and construction process makes it especially vulnerable should the market head south. If history has taught us anything it’s that financing and mortgage lenders tend to take it on the chin when the housing market goes into recession or crashes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe second area of concern should be the fact that TOL stock has been on a monster run over the last year. In the past 12 months, Toll Brothers’ share price has increased 80%, driven largely by accelerating demand for the new properties it sees through from initial design to the construction and financing. The red hot rally should make investors weary of getting in at the top only to see the share price plunge should the bottom fall out of the residential and commercial real estate markets.Story continuesMasco Corp. (MAS)A photo of a black faucet and sink next to a window.Source: Elena Podrezenko / Shutterstock.comIn business since 1929, Masco Corp. (NYSE:MAS) manufacturers popular products used in new home construction throughout the U.S. These products include faucets, showerheads, cabinet hardware and toilets, among other items. As one might expect, right now is boom times at Masco and the company’s stock has gained 14% in the last 12 months. Over five years, the share price is up 43%. But, the company is vulnerable to boom-bust cycles.Masco has certainly been here before. The company’s share price collapsed and was trading in penny stock territory in 2009 after the last U.S. housing bubble burst and we entered the Great Recession. While the company and its stock have clawed their way back over the last decade, they could be negatively impacted if interest rates push the housing sector and broader economy into a recession in 2024. The company also has massive overhead with more than 25,000 employees and 90 manufacturing facilities worldwide.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett might have taken a position in D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), but does that mean you should? DHI is highly exposed should demand for new home construction falter. And since it was disclosed that Buffett has taken a shine to homebuilders, DHI stock has declined 6%. The company’s share price is still up nearly 60% over the last 12 months, but signs are emerging that the stock is cooling off after a hot streak.It’s also notable that Buffett’s stake in DHI stock is comparatively small, comprising just 0.2% of his portfolio and worth a total of $645 million. Anything under $1 billion is a pretty small investment for the Oracle of Omaha. With home construction activity in 29 states, D.R. Horton will no doubt be seriously impacted should the housing market swoon. The company also just named Paul Romanowski as its new president and CEO. It is risky undertaking a leadership transition at the highest levels during a sensitive time for the economy and markets. This is among homebuilder stocks where it is wise to proceed with caution.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnderstanding the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.5. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.What is the Altman Z-score?Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The company's cryptocurrency machines are located in the United States.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapKey Drivers of Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) might be a potential value trap due to its low Altman Z-Score and declining financial health. Thorough due diligence and careful consideration of these risk factors are crucial before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

QCOM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of QCOMInsider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's President QTL &amp; Global Affairs Alexander Rogers Sells 6,001 SharesAlexander Rogers is a key figure at Qualcomm Inc, serving as the President of QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) &amp; Global Affairs. His role involves overseeing the company's global licensing business and managing relationships with regulators, governments, and customers worldwide. His recent sell-off of shares could be indicative of his personal investment strategy or a reflection of his perspective on the company's future prospects.Qualcomm Inc is a world leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry. The company's portfolio includes products and services for mobile devices and infrastructure, including semiconductors, system software, and related applications. Qualcomm's technologies are used in various industries, including automotive, computing, IoT, and healthcare.The insider's recent sell-off is part of a broader trend within Qualcomm Inc. Over the past year, there have been 10 insider sells and no insider buys. This could potentially signal a bearish sentiment within the company's upper echelons. However, it's important to note that insider selling does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for the company. Insiders may sell shares for personal reasons unrelated to the company's performance or prospects.Insider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's President QTL &amp; Global Affairs Alexander Rogers Sells 6,001 SharesOn the day of the insider's recent sell, Qualcomm Inc's shares were trading at $110.4 each, giving the company a market cap of $123.99 billion. The stock's price-earnings ratio stands at 14.43, lower than both the industry median of 23.68 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical performance.Story continuesFurthermore, with a price of $110.4 and a GuruFocus Value of $149.93, Qualcomm Inc has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.74. This indicates that the stock is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell-off may raise eyebrows, the stock's valuation metrics suggest that Qualcomm Inc may still present a good investment opportunity.

While such ups and downs are part of a stock’s progression, the sudden turn of events often tests the stock's inherent strength to withstand the storm and its ability to come up trumps. We believe that Qualcomm has the requisite wherewithal to emerge victorious from the apparent upheaval and strike the right chords in the near future.  Early this month, Qualcomm and BMW Group extended their technology partnership to redefine the automotive landscape. The collaboration is set to power BMW's new vehicles with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis Solution. It aims to provide drivers and passengers with safer, smarter and more sophisticated in-vehicle experiences. BMW has chosen Qualcomm as its systems solution provider, incorporating the latest Snapdragon Cockpit Platform and Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platforms for 5G connectivity.One key aspect of this partnership is the integration of Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms into new BMW vehicles and MINI's New Family vehicles. These platforms enhance the user experience by offering high-definition graphics, premium audio, crystal-clear voice communication and AI-driven features. As Qualcomm continues to innovate and collaborate, it is poised to reap the rewards of a dynamic and evolving automotive landscape.During the month, Qualcomm inked an agreement with Manchester United plc MANU to be the official shirt sponsor from next season. Per the deal, effective from the start of the 2024-25 season, the Snapdragon brand of Qualcomm will be put in front of the iconic jerseys of the English Premier League (“EPL”) club. Snapdragon will feature on all the home, away and third kits of the men’s and women’s teams of Manchester United, replacing Germany-based software firm TeamViewer. Although no official deal value is currently available, people familiar with the proceedings have billed it to be one of the largest jersey deals in soccer.The three-year agreement with one of the premier EPL soccer clubs with a dedicated fanbase is likely to prove beneficial for Qualcomm and augment its global exposure. Manchester United historically sells around 2 million shirts each year on average, with the club maintaining a rich legacy and huge fan-following base across the globe. This, in turn, is likely to provide additional mileage for upcoming Snapdragon models with top-of-the-mind recall and boost its brand presence.The deal gains further significance as Qualcomm chips will be featured in the upcoming iPhone models with a renewed deal inked with Apple Inc. AAPL. The chipmaker entered into a multi-year agreement with Apple to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF systems for forthcoming iPhones.In addition to incremental revenues, the deal augments QCOM's leadership position across 5G technologies and products. It also gains weightage as the chipmaker is expected to record softer revenues from China owing to strict restrictions on iPhone usage. Per various media reports, Beijing is mulling to impose a ban on the use of iPhones in government offices and state-backed entities as part of its concerted effort toward self-reliance. The restrictions on Apple are likely to have a profound effect on Qualcomm, which is one of the leading suppliers to the iPhone manufacturing firm.Over the years, China has been one of the primary markets for Apple. As the news of the purported ban spread like wildfire, Apple’s shares slumped and wiped nearly $200 billion in market capitalization. This further affected its suppliers like Qualcomm, among others. Qualcomm modems have been a key feature in iPhone models, connecting the device to cellular networks for fast web browsing and instant app access. Built on indigenous technology that requires specialized engineering expertise and broad industry know-how, these modems have been the hallmark of impeccable performance standards.Moreover, as China accounts for the lion’s share of Qualcomm’s revenues, any disruption in local operation is bound to have a ripple effect across the company. The chip-making firm has a significant presence in more than 12 cities in China, aiming to drive advancements in semiconductors and mobile telecommunications for the larger benefit. The company has been a key supplier of chips and other related components to local smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei and its spin-off brand Honor. However, it appears that Qualcomm is increasingly finding it difficult to maintain its operations in China.Much of these hardships can be attributed to the continued Sino-U.S. trade spat. The U.S. Commerce Department has long imposed various trade restrictions against China that banned the sale of high-tech equipment, chips, components and related technology to develop high-end smartphones and AI-enabled chips. Despite adding China-based Huawei to the ‘Entity List,’ the newly developed Huawei Mate 60 smartphone is believed to have violated the U.S. trade sanctions. This has forced the U.S. watchdog to enforce stricter trade restrictions while conducting the authenticity of the trade violations.Qualcomm is reportedly undertaking job cuts and retrenchments to sustain its business in China. Local media reports claim that the company has laid off dozens of people from its research and development facility in Shanghai, raising questions about its long-term viability plans.In the backdrop of these events, we believe that the company will strive to maintain an optimum balance between its China operations and conforming to the national interests of both countries. Although shares did have a knee-jerk reaction triggered by the sudden developments, we expect the company to retrace its growth trajectory in the near future.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge Funds.The augmented reality market has promising growth prospects given the tech industry’s massive shift towards immersive reality, metaverse, Internet of Things and AI. A Mordor Intelligence report estimates that the overall size of the augmented reality market was expected to grow from $29.84 billion in 2023 to $174.47 billion by 2028. This would be a CAGR of 42.36%.While AI takes all the media hype, major companies are continuously launching new AR/VR products that are changing the way we interact with the physical world. For example, earlier this year, Google launched Geospatial Creator, a set of tools powered by ARCore and Google Maps Platform. The tools will allow developers to build and “scale AR immersive experiences easily and accurately using various technologies, such as Photorealistic 3D Tiles, Rooftop anchors, Streetscape Geometry, and Scene Semantics.”Apple earlier this year upped the ante in the AR/VR race by revealing its Vision Pro headset, which would have a hefty price tag of $3,499. The mixed-reality headset is scheduled for release in early 2024.Many other companies are jumping in the race to compete with bigger companies. The company behind Pokemon Go, Ninantic, is making its own “visual positioning system” (VPS) to compete with Google.In this backdrop it'd be interesting to see which augmented reality stocks smart money investors are piling into. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds and picked 16 augmented reality stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Top Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge FundsPhoto by David Grandmougin on UnsplashTop 16 Augmented Reality (AR) Stocks Among Hedge Funds16. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 7Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) sells wearable display technology and augmented reality products. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) is down about 40% over the past one year. In August Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) posted strong Q2 results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at -$0.14 beating estimates by $0.03. Revenue in the quarter jumped about 56.3% year over year to $4.69 million, beating estimates by $0.42 million.Story continuesOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 7 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI). The most significant stakeholder of Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) was ARK Investment Management of Catherine D. Wood which owns a $33 million stake in the company.15. Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14California-based Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) makes haptic technology that is used in AR and VR devices. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR). The biggest stakeholder of Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) during this period was Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates which owns a $7.4 million stake in the company.Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) is also a dividend-paying stock. Earlier in September Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) declared a dividend of $0.03 per share, in-line with the previous dividend. The dividend is payable on October 27 for shareholders of record as of October 16.14. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Snap is one of the most notable AR companies in the world. The company offers AR lenses and spectacles, along with several filters and in-app AR features. Earlier this year Snap introduced ray tracing technology to its AR Lens Studio for developers. The company said this technology will allow realistic renderings of light and shine on AR artifacts.Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“SNAP shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth, while announcing a broadbased cost restructuring.Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”13. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Gaming company Unity software stands to benefit from the AR revolution as more and more companies hire AR and VR experts to develop immersive reality games.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 30 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company.12. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) shares have gained about 25% over the past one year. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) sells OLED Micro-display products that are used in immersive products like VR and AR headsets and glasses. Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) also sells controllers for haptic feedback and immersive experiences for games, virtual reality and other applications.A total of 31 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) as of the end of the second quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) was Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors which owns a $138 million stake in the company.Aristotle Capital made the following comment about Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”11. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Online gaming platform Roblox allows gamers and developers build virtual worlds. The company could gain on the back of the upcoming VR revolution. The stock is currently in the spotlight after SoMA Partners’ Gil Simon said in an interview with CNBC that Roblox stock could double.""We think the next few years is a nice trajectory for them to increase those margins by as much as 300 basis points a year. We think next year will be an up year, this year will be the trough and we are looking out to 2025 and 2026 and we think those margins could be back into the 20s,” Simon said.Artisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated new GardenSM positions in Keysight, Roblox and Liberty Media Corp–Liberty Formula One during the quarter. Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is an online platform that allows users to play games created by other users and to create their own games using the Roblox Studio, a robust suite of development and coding tools. The company’s model is similar to a social network in that user-generated content scales with user growth on the platform and benefits from viral adoption. While the graphics, user interface and general gameplay currently appeal more to younger people, Roblox is pursuing a strategy of investing heavily to accelerate its technological capabilities so that it can provide experiences that appeal to an older demographic. We believe the valuation is justifiable given the stickiness of the core platform (the average user spends 2.4 hours per day on Roblox), its attractive business model and a potential bull case where Roblox becomes a leading place to create and consume social 3D experiences for the general population.Roblox is another (there are more) example of a company that is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI advancements. As discussed earlier, Roblox is a social gaming platform that relies on user-generated content. This content is enabled by the platform’s robustyet-simple tools for relatively novice developers. AI has the potential to turbocharge this tool set—with AI-assisted code building and generative artwork creation. Over time, this should enable a deeper pool of user-generated content that attracts an expanding set of game players.”10. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that would gain both directly and indirectly from the AR market.

The most significant stakeholder of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) was David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management which owns a $777 million stake in the company.9. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Gaming company Take Two is expected to gain from the rise of AR games. The company is expected to roll out next-gen games in the coming months and weeks that will have immersive reality features.Diamond Hill All Cap Select Strategy made the following comment about Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Video game developer Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) has faced weakness in the mobile gaming market, in addition to game-launching delays. The company reported underwhelming quarterly results in Q4 and lowered its full-year guidance. After reexamining our long-term thesis, we decided to exit our position in favor of more attractive opportunities.”8. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Technologies, platforms and products made by QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) play a key role in enabling companies in developing next-generation AR systems.

(NASDAQ:ADBE)’s research team is also working to develop various AR and VR photography tools and technologies.One of the biggest growth catalysts for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) could be AI. Recently, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and upped its price target on the stock to $625 from $550, citing growth opportunities from generative AI.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.22%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.67%.Coming into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 8.75% in the past month. In that same time, the Aerospace sector lost 7.95%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.45%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Lockheed Martin as it approaches its next earnings report date.

These results would represent year-over-year changes of -0.26% and +1%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $305.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will procure long-lead time materials to support the low-rate initial production of the 18th lot of F135 propulsion systems, for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.Work related to this deal will be carried out in various locations within as well as outside the continental U.S.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.RTX’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 421 jets in the backlog as of Jun 25, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster RTX’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed and RTX, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 have been discussed below.Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. Northrop Grumman is part of the international partnership involved in building three variants of the F-35 jets.It is engaged in the design and production of the AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite, which can be dynamically programmed to arm the F-35 pilot with multiple-mission capabilities, engineered for seamless transition from one mission phase to the next.BAE Systems BAESY: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.In 2023, BAE Systems celebrated the delivery of its 1000th rear fuselage to Lockheed from its facilities in the North West of the U.K. In the United States, BAE Systems’ test pilots and engineers are working to get the aircraft ready to meet the needs of its customers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This leads to increased order inflows for LMT to manufacture such missiles for the military, like the latest one. This tends to boost its revenue generation prospects.Growth ProspectsPer a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the missile and missile defense systems market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4.8% during the 2023-2028 period. This unfolds immense opportunities for LMT as the company is a pioneer of high-performance missiles and missile defense successfully delivering these capabilities to military forces globally.Other prominent players in the defense landscape poised to gain from the growing missile market are as follows:RTX Corporation RTX: Raytheon offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), AIM-9X missiles, Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Story continuesIn September 2023, RTX secured a modification contract to boost capacity for the production of AIM-9X missiles, the most advanced infrared-tracking, short-range, air-to-air and surface-to-air missile in the world.Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC: Northrop manufactures a variety of air, sea and land-based missile systems’ propulsion control systems that support the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Dominican Republic's economic growth and foreign investments, you may go to the 5 Best Places to Retire in Dominican Republic.Dominican Republic's Economic Growth and Foreign InvestmentsAccording to the World Bank, the Dominican Republic has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America over the past 50 years. In 2022, real GDP in the country grew by 4.9%, primarily driven by services. In the same period, the hotels, bars, and restaurants sector grew by a remarkable 24%. A resurgence in global tourism and an effective government vaccination campaign have been responsible for this growth. Following this development, there has been a decline in poverty levels, while the middle class has witnessed a notable swing. Despite all these positive aspects, growth sectors have failed to expand economic opportunities for the country or even improve the quality of life for its people to a great extent. For this reason, efforts are being made to attract foreign direct investment to the country that can help achieve the same.Many American companies have already chosen to establish an industrial presence in the Dominican Republic. Companies such as Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) are few such companies that have made the country an industrial hub for their operations. While it is true that these companies have been making the most out of the Dominican Republic, the country's actual offerings in terms of quality, connectivity, and productivity can be finely highlighted through its relationship with Jabil Inc. (NYSE:JBL). Jabil Inc. (NYSE:JBL) is an American worldwide manufacturing company that specializes in outsourcing manufacturing for companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Only recently, Jabil Inc. (NYSE:JBL)'s site in the Dominican Republic is the first to achieve MedAccred accreditation for Plastics Mechanical Assembly. This accreditation meets the audit requirements set by MedAccred subscribing members – including Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), BD, Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Medtronic, and Philips, etc. Through this accreditation, critical manufacturing processes will be able to meet industry consensus requirements, thereby leading to the production of high-quality end products that ultimately enhance patient safety. Jabil’s Dominican Republic operations support Jabil Healthcare, a division of Jabil, which aims to provide expertise in manufacturing and supply chain solutions.Story continuesAs such, it is safe to say that the Dominican Republic has successfully attracted medical device manufacturing to the country due to its free trade zones, an initiative that provides a specialized logistics launching platform, and attractive tax incentives to companies. These companies are not only contributing to the economic growth of the Dominican Republic, but are also actively participating in community initiatives aimed at reducing crime rates and cultivating a skilled technical workforce. In particular, the USAID has been partnering with a free trade zone called PIISA Industrial Park, whose tenants include Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), to recruit and retain at-risk youth and boost their workforce skills.Since the Dominican Republic has been actively welcoming foreign investments in the country to enhance economic opportunities and raise the quality of life for its people, it is no wonder that more and more expats are attracted to the country. It is already one of the cheapest countries for retirement, and expats love to come here to stretch their retirement savings further than they can in their home countries.Retiring to the Dominican RepublicKnown for being one of the best retirement destinations in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic stands out as an attractive choice for retirees. Its appeal is bolstered by its natural beauty, affordability, and delightful climate. As of 2022, 5,217 Social Security Benefits were claimed from within the country, reaffirming the country’s status as one of the most popular overseas retirement destinations.There are many pros and cons of retiring in the Dominican Republic. As discussed, the country has one of the most affordable living costs, and living off social security is very much possible in the country. Even large cities such as Santo Domingo have much lower costs than the United States. Moreover, delicious food isn't all that expensive here, either. Traditionally, a typical meal costs only a few dollars in the Caribbean. Street food and even high-end restaurant food are all reasonably affordable as well. Beaches are only short drives away, which means lots of relaxation and activities to enjoy. Last but not the least, healthcare in the country is highly affordable.However, there are also some disadvantages to living in the Dominican Republic. For instance, the quality of healthcare is low. Public hospitals are not preferable for treatment for expats, and it's best to avail private healthcare that is decent, although it is not as good as it is in the States. Expats may also be at risk of theft or robberies, so it's best to stay in safe communities and cities only.For this reason, we have developed a list of the best places to live in the Dominican Republic, so retirees can explore their options and decide which one is best suited to them. Many retirees often get confused between Panama, Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica when choosing where to retire. When deciding between Panama vs the Dominican Republic for retirement, or even Costa Rica vs. Dominican Republic for retirement, retirees should know that Panama offers financial stability, modern amenities, and diverse landscapes. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic is revered for its low cost of living, natural beauty, and rich cultural experience. Moreover, retirees prefer Costa Rica for its excellent healthcare, stunning natural beauty, and stable political environment.

Tagrisso is AZN’s third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with proven clinical activity in NSCLC.AstraZeneca received the FDA approval for Tagrisso in March 2017 for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.JNJ’s Rybrevant is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.The MARIPOSA study met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving Rybrevant plus lazertinib compared with AZN’s Tagrisso, demonstrating statistical significance and clinically meaningful improvement.Furthermore, an interim analysis of the overall survival (OS), one of the secondary endpoints of the study, also favored the treatment arm receiving the combination therapy of Rybrevant and lazertinib compared with Tagrisso. However, the statistical and clinical significance of OS data has not been determined yet.Other secondary endpoints in the MARIPOSA study include objective response rate, duration of response, intracranial PFS, PFS after first subsequent therapy and time to symptomatic progression.The safety profile of the Rybrevant/lazertinib combo was also consistent with that observed in previously reported data of the combo drug.Management claims that the current standard-of-care EFGR TKIs in the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC often lead to resistance and disease progression when used as monotherapy, representing a serious unmet medical need. The combination therapy of Rybrevant and lazertinib, subject to successful development, has the potential to advance treatment beyond TKI monotherapy in this indication.Story continuesThe data readout from the MARIPOSA study marks the third late-stage study on Rybrevant to be announced in 2023, following results from the PAPILLON and MARIPOSA-2 studies.JNJ plans to present results from MARIPOSA, PAPILLON and MARIPOSA-2 studies at an upcoming medical conference, which will include additional details on select secondary endpoints.Johnson and Johnson is also currently evaluating Rybrevant in multiple other studies in NSCLC indication.Currently, the standard of care in the frontline treatment of metastatic NSCLC is Merck’s MRK Keytruda. Notably, Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, is MRK’s blockbuster oncology drug and approved for several types of cancer, accounting alone for around 40% of Merck’s pharmaceutical sales.Keytruda is presently approved to treat seven indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale Now.Warren Buffett stands out as the most successful investor after nearly six decades of making waves in the investment world. Even though he turned 93 this year, he is still at the top of his game with sharp mental acuity that is the envy of most investors. Together with his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, they are not showing any signs of slowing down as they remain focused on generating respectable returns for their investors.With a net worth of over $110 billion, Buffett is one of the highest-paid hedge fund managers owing to the solid returns his investment affirms Berkshire Hathaway has always generated. The legendary investor boasts an impressive track record with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway, having delivered a compound annual gain of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. That is nearly double the 9.9% compound annual gain of the S&amp;P 500.The impressive returns also amount to an overall total return of 3,787,464% dwarfing the 24,708% gain for the S&amp;P 500. Thus, it is not surprising that investors stuck with Buffett's investment strategies have generated millions of dollars. The high returns explain why investors are always watching Berkshire Hathaway to get a glimpse of the direction the market is likely to move and ideal investment opportunities.Buffett has made a name for himself as a value-oriented investor who takes out positions in companies he feels are highly undervalued and misunderstood. The value investing strategy focuses on the intrinsic value of a particular stock rather than technical indicators. In this case, he focuses on understanding the company’s financials, focusing on earnings and income statements, underlying fundamentals, and long-term prospects.He is best known as a buy-and-hold investor not interested in buying and selling stocks in the near term for quick profits. Instead, he settles on stocks he feels offer solid long-term prospects for moderate but reliable growth. In the second quarter, Buffett's portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway was worth $348 billion, an increase from $325 billion in the first quarter.Story continuesThe Berkshire Hathaway manager has been ramping up his position in his favorite stock, Apple, which now accounts for 40% of the holding company's 13F equity portfolio. Buffett has always been bullish on Apple owing to its lucrative buyback program that has made the investment firm over $100 billion since 2016. Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and American Express are some of his other top picks.Recently, Buffett has been one of the most aggressive hedge fund managers, taking advantage of the high-interest rate environment. Backed by a mountain of cash, $147 billion at the end of June, the legendary investor has been pursuing investments that can generate substantial returns with short-term rates topping 5%.The legendary investor has already started betting on the housing market amid the rising mortgage rates, having bought more than $700 million worth of homebuilder DR Horton stock. He has also taken out stakes in fellow builders Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR).15 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale NowWhile the focus has always been Buffett's stellar market performance, it’s becoming increasingly clear that gurus are not immune to mistakes or bad investments.

160,477f27d2-ede6-3a5d-8ad8-a298a71fce7b,MDT,2023-10-03,Don’t Miss the Boom: 7 Dividend Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-boom-7-161511477.html,1695744911,STORY,"['O', 'XOM', 'MDT', 'ESS', 'SWK', 'BF-B', 'HRL']","[The economic outlook is increasingly uncertain. Between inflation, high-interest rates, and an aggressive Federal Reserve, there is plenty that could hamper the market’s returns over the next year. However, there is one area of the market with a steadier outlook: High-quality dividend stocks. In particular, the Dividend Aristocrats are a great place to go hunting for stable firms that can provide generous income through all economic climates.That’s because these companies have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years, proving their trustworthiness on a grand scale. These are the seven best dividend stocks to buy for consistent income and tantalizing share price upside.Dividend Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. It also has chemical and refining assets, which have proven invaluable in recent years. Especially as refining margins have soared and chemical prices turned higher amid the current inflationary wave.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBetter, Exxon has continued to grow in its core oil production business as well. Unlike many firms that have pivoted to renewable energy, Exxon Mobil has remained focused on increasing production from traditional oil fields. That has paid off in spades recently with the price of oil skyrocketing. Exxon’s new offshore field in Guyana, in particular, has proven to be a gusher.Exxon’s massive business produces tremendous cash flows and has delivered steadily increasing dividends for decades now. And the current macroeconomic and geopolitical instability seems likely to support higher commodity prices, and, as such, further gains for XOM stock.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a leading power tools company that has enjoyed a tremendous run-up during the early days of the pandemic. People were stuck at home and decided to invest in tools for home maintenance and renovation projects. As a result, Stanley Black &amp; Decker enjoyed record sales and profits. Since then, however, sales have fallen back to normal. As a result, profits fell even further as the company got stuck with excess inventory. Most people don’t need to buy new power tools every year, and as such, a lot of folks who bought new equipment in 2020 or 2021 will be set for a while.Story continuesHowever, the negativity is dramatically overblown. SWK stock fell from a peak of more than $200/share to just $83 today. Furthermore, shares went for about $160 prior to the onset of COVID-19. All this speaks to a company where sharp near-term negativity has caused its shares to slump beyond any reasonable valuation. With the drop, SWK stock now yields 3.9%.Dividend Stocks: Hormel Foods (HRL)Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company focused on proteins. The company was founded more than a century ago and originally focused on commodity meat goods along with its SPAM canned pork product.However, the Hormel of today is a wholly different animal. Now Hormel has best-selling brands within varied fields including organic deli meats, bacon and pepperoni, almonds and nut butter, and ready-to-eat guacamole. Hormel has evolved with the times and now has a leading brand portfolio that is squarely focused on appealing to millennial and Gen Z consumers.Hormel’s profitability has slipped over the past two years. That comes due to supply chain and labor issues which have driven up Hormel’s production costs. However, as livestock and grain prices have slipped and supply chains have started to catch back up, that is relieving much of the problems on the cost side.All this sets up for Hormel to deliver sharply higher profits as its business gets back to regular operations. Meanwhile, thanks to the near-term dip in Hormel’s earnings and stock price, the company is now offering a solid 2.8% starting dividend yield.Essex Property Trust (ESS)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockEssex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) is a leading West Coast multifamily apartment owner. Its portfolio consists of more than 62,000 apartments spread across 252 different communities. Essex believes its apartments are well-situated as they are in cities with high growth, and which are home to attractive high-paying industries such as technology.Most real estate investment trusts (REITs), including Essex, have slumped this year. The industry is dealing with higher interest rates, which cause a firm’s debt to cost more upon refinancing. In addition, investors have demanded higher dividends from stocks to compensate for the rise in interest rates on risk-free bonds and certificates of deposit.This selling has created a buy-the-dip opportunity in ESS stock. As high interest rates make home mortgages more expensive, we will see that serve as a structural driver that boosts demand for apartments. And, in the longer term, rents have a tendency to keep rising at a steady clip, which will grow Essex’s cash flows considerably over time.Dividend Stocks: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is another REIT that has sold off this year. The firm is a triple net lease REIT, which is a type of rental arrangement where the tenants — rather than the landlord — pay for key expenses such as maintenance and utilities.O stock has slumped due to higher interest rates and economic concerns. Much of Realty Income’s business is in renting properties to industrial and retail firms, and folks are understandably cautious about the outlook given the possibility of a recession. However, these worries have pushed Realty Income shares into bargain territory. Now offering a 6% yield, Realty Income is near its lowest valuation in many years. Adding to the attraction for income investors, Realty Income pays its dividend in monthly installments.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a medical device company that is known for its cardiology products. Over the years, however, it has grown and now addresses a wide range of other conditions such as diabetes and neurology.Medtronic has been a massive winner historically. However, after decades of outperformance, MDT stock has hit a pause. Shares are at $80 today; that’s the same price they were at back in 2016. The underperformance is in large part because of the pandemic. There were many delays around elective surgeries at that time. And supply chain and clinical disruptions made it harder to research and bring new products to market. It likely won’t be until at least mid-2024 before Medtronic gets fully back on track operationally.However, the long-term opportunity remains tremendous; analysts believe the global market will reach nearly $1 trillion in revenue by 2030. Medtronic stock is a relative bargain today at 16 times earnings and with a 3.4% dividend yield.Brown-Forman (BF-B)a close up of Jack Daniels WhiskeySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) is a leading alcoholic spirits company. It is primarily known for its Jack Daniels whiskey. That brand was so powerful that the firm survived even the U.S. prohibition without going bust. In more recent years, in addition to growing Jack Daniels into an international franchise, Brown-Forman has also made a heavy push into the booming tequila market.Brown-Forman shares have underperformed recently. Like other consumer staples companies such as Hormel, Brown-Forman faces margin pressure. The cost of product inputs such as agave (for tequila) and bottles and packaging material soared during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the temporary closure of bars and restaurants pressured on-premise demand.As these issues clear up and the industry returns to regular conditions, however, Brown-Forman will see its profitability pick back up. In the long run, spirits companies have tremendous brands, and wonderful profit margins, and operate in an industry with minimal risk of technological disruption. All this makes Brown-Forman a great dividend stock for the long haul that is currently undervalued due to temporary market conditions.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HRL, MDT, BF.A, SWK, and XOM stock.

""The choice between doing so and weathering the ... massive fines and taxes is no choice at all""At least seven of the drugmakers have sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Medicare agency, calling the process unconstitutional price setting.On Friday, a federal judge rejected an attempt by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to block the program in a lawsuit. Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk filed its own lawsuit on Friday in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey.The U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), did not immediately comment.CMS chose the drugs based on certain criteria set out by Medicare. They must be sold in pharmacies, not have substantial generic competition, and have been on the market for at least nine years - 13 for more complex biotech drugs.The drugs involved in the first round of price talks are: blood thinner Eliquis from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer; Merck &amp; Co's diabetes drug Januvia; Eliquis rival Xarelto as well as arthritis and Crohn's disease medicine Stelara from Johnson &amp; Johnson; AbbVie's leukemia treatment Imbruvica; Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel; Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance; and insulin from Novo Nordisk.Story continuesOnly the nine primary manufacturers of the 10 drugs were required to sign off on the deal with CMS.The new prices, which will be required to be at least 25% lower than their current list, would take effect in 2026. The program aims to save $25 billion per year on drug prices by 2031.The companies will have a chance to meet with CMS later this autumn and the regulator will send them a proposal for its ""maximum fair price"" for the drugs by Feb. 1, 2024.Keep up with the latest medical breakthroughs and healthcare trends with our newsletter Reuters Health Rounds.

A final decision is expected by Mar 26, 2024.If approved, Merck’s sotatercept will provide a new treatment option for patients and bring a novel approach to PAH treatment.The BLA filing is based on data from the phase III STELLAR study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotatercept against placebo as an add-on to the current standard of care for adults with PAH. The study achieved its primary endpoint of sotatercept exhibiting significant improvement in exercise capacity, as measured by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and eight of nine key secondary outcome measures.PAH is a rare, progressive blood vessel disorder that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart, resulting in elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. It exerts significant strain on the heart, causing limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. The five-year mortality rate for patients with this disease is around 43%. Per Merck, around 40,000 people in the United States suffer from PAH.Sotatercept is designed to target cellular signaling associated with vascular hyperproliferation and pathological remodeling to treat PAH. The FDA has granted the drug breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations for PAH treatment.Merck added sotatercept following its acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. The drug is the subject of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb BMY. Following the acquisition of Acceleron, Merck also added the anemia drug Reblozyl to its portfolio of marketed drugs. Reblozyl is being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.Story continuesMerck receives milestone and royalty payments on Reblozyl product sales from Bristol Myers as part of the collaboration. Bristol Myers generated $440 million from Reblozyl product sales in first-half 2023, up 34% year over year, driven by higher demand.A significant player in the target market is United Therapeutics UTHR which markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States – Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca.UTHR markets Tyvaso, which is an inhaled formulation of treprostinil while Remodulin is an injectable formulation. United Therapeutics also markets Orenitram, the oral version of treprostinil and Adcirca (tadalafil) tablets.Last year in May, the FDA approved United Therapeutics’ new drug application (“NDA”) for the dry powder inhalation (“DPI”) formulation for Tyvaso. The NDA also included a device for the administration of the new formulation. As a result of this approval, UTHR has generated $557.3 million from Tyvaso sales in first-half 2023, up 49% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There's no doubt about it,"" Calhoun said in a July earnings call.Story continuesThe Boeing CEO added the second half of 2024 would be a key moment for the company to prove it could keep its supply chain stable and maintain its ramp up plan.""If we get through that well and we execute well, then we'll be talking to all of you about 60 deliveries,"" Calhoun said at the time.

ERJ signed a Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SIA Engineering (Philippines) Corporation (“SIAEP”), a subsidiary of SIA Engineering Company Limited. This partnership will enable SIAEP to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for Embraer's E-Jets E2 family of aircraft.Since 2017, SIAEP has been serving as Embraer’s authorized Asia-Pacific E-Jet service center. In addition to the existing E-Jet presence in APAC, this MoU provides a good starting point for ERJ in terms of discussing additional support for the expanding E-Jet E2 fleet within the region.Growth ProspectsEmbraer continues to witness strong market demand for its E-jets worldwide. E2 is the second generation of the E-jet family of commercial aircraft. The company had seven E2 deliveries in the second quarter, up more than 100% from the year-ago quarter’s level. As of Jun 30, 2023, Embraer’s E-Jets E2 had 281 orders in the backlog, along with strong sales performance in Executive Aviation.Per a report by the International Air Transport Association, published in June 2023, the demand for air travel is expected to double by 2040, growing at an annual average rate of 3.4%.To duly reap the benefits of such abounding growth prospects offered by the commercial aerospace, Embraer is making valuable partnerships, like the latest one, in addition to upgrading its aircraft.Notably, in August 2023, Embraer announced the expansion of its partnership with CAE Inc. CAE to promote pilot training services for its E-Jet E2 family of commercial aircraft. Embraer-CAE Training Services (“ECTS”) was created through this joint venture to provide pilot and cabin crew training for E-Jet E2 family of jets.  Considering the fact that the E-Jet services and support are available to more than 940 customers in 70 countries, we may expect ECTS to become available in other parts of the world in the coming years. This, in turn, should boost growth prospects for both Embraer and CAE.Story continuesPeer MovesApart from Embraer, other jet companies that may benefit from the growing commercial aerospace industry have been discussed below.Boeing BA: Boeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. During the second quarter, the Boeing Commercial Airplanes segment observed a solid 12.4% year-over-year surge in commercial jet deliveries, buoyed by higher 787 jet deliveries. This, in turn, resulted in a 41% increase in the unit’s revenues.In second-quarter 2023, Boeing delivered 136 commercial airplanes and received 460 net orders. With the new airplanes, which are yet to be delivered, the company should benefit from the trending air travel demand trail.Airbus EADSY: In the first half of 2023, Airbus delivered 316 commercial aircraft and targets to deliver 720 in 2023.  In August 2023, Wizz Air signed a contract for an additional 75 A321 neo Family aircraft, taking its total order for the largest member of the Airbus single-aisle to 434.Airbus boasts an order backlog of 7,967 commercial aircraft as of Jun 30, 2023. Such solid delivery and backlog count reflects the strong demand that Airbus enjoys in the commercial aerospace market.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In second-quarter 2023, KBR received $2.2 billion in bookings and options in highly strategic areas with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.1x.Government Solutions Business – Growth DriverAs of Jun 30, 2023, nearly 70% of the backlog represents work in the Government Solutions (GS) unit (which accounted for 81% of 2022 revenues). This notable increase is primarily due to the favorable defense, space, and military budgets, which have driven higher demand for the company's GS services. It's important to note that the majority of these projects are long-term reimbursable service contracts with annuity-like characteristics, significantly reducing the inherent risks compared to some other projects.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $305.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by July 2026. Per the terms of the deal, RTX will procure long-lead time materials to support the low-rate initial production of the 18th lot of F135 propulsion systems, for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.Work related to this deal will be carried out in various locations within as well as outside the continental U.S.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-U.S. Department of Defense participants.RTX’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 421 jets in the backlog as of Jun 25, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster RTX’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed and RTX, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 have been discussed below.Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. Northrop Grumman is part of the international partnership involved in building three variants of the F-35 jets.It is engaged in the design and production of the AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation and Identification avionics suite, which can be dynamically programmed to arm the F-35 pilot with multiple-mission capabilities, engineered for seamless transition from one mission phase to the next.BAE Systems BAESY: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment, supports F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.In 2023, BAE Systems celebrated the delivery of its 1000th rear fuselage to Lockheed from its facilities in the North West of the U.K. In the United States, BAE Systems’ test pilots and engineers are working to get the aircraft ready to meet the needs of its customers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earlier this year, investors also saw England-based tech company Arm (ARM), Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava (CAVA), and grocery delivery service company Instacart (CART) go public, among others.According to Ben Laidler, eToro global markets strategist, Birkenstock could be the ""real test"" for the IPO market recovery.""It hasn't been publicly listed [before] like Arm, is less well known, and it doesn't have the obvious valuation discount that Instacart had, so maybe this is the real test as to whether the IPO market is reopening for real or whether this was a false storm,"" Laidler said.A nearly 250-year-old company goes publicSo far this year, IPOs have received mixed reactions.Instacart stock is down 35.8% from its IPO price as of Monday after a choppy initial reaction from investors. Shares of the England-based tech company Arm (ARM) are also down nearly 12% from its IPO debut. And Cava stock (CAVA), which soared in its IPO debut earlier this summer, is down 30%.""It just shows that IPO investors are still not totally convinced that the IPO market is back,"" Renaissance Capital research director Nick Einhorn told Yahoo Finance Live. ""They're a little jittery. Maybe some of them are taking gains early once these companies priced up.""Laidler also noted that this reaction should be expected for companies that are willing to test the waters.Story continues""These are the trailblazers after the IPO winter that we've lived through for the last 18 months,"" Laidler said. ""So I think they [were] always going to face a lot of scrutiny.""Birkenstock models stand in a retail store of the shoe manufacturer on Sept. 13, 2023, in Berlin, Germany, as the company prepares its US IPO. (Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)As the next big IPO, Birkenstock will have to work to win over US investors.""I would say it puts the onus on them to have a very good story ... to persuade investors that there are great things coming that are worth paying out for,"" Laidler said.Founded in 1774, the sandal maker has a long history, something the company's CEO Oliver Reichert, who has led the company since 2013, addressed in a letter to proposed shareholders.""Despite this heritage, Birkenstock remains empowered by a youthful energy level, with all the freshness and creative versatility of an inspired Silicon Valley start-up,"" Reichert wrote. ""We have retained the original spirit of our forefathers who laid the foundation of a global business that is more relevant than ever before.""In fiscal 2022, the company brought in 1.24 billion euros in revenue, up from 727.9 million euros in fiscal 2020, at an annual growth rate of 31%. Despite its European origins, its strongest market is the Americas, representing 54% of its revenue in fiscal 2022, followed by Europe at 36%.Laidler noted that half of the companies that listed in the US this year have been foreign companies, which ""speaks to the strength [and] attractiveness of the US as an IPO destination.""The US footwear market has also been ""surprisingly strong,"" Laidler said.

Even so, Nike EVP and CFO Matthew Friend said the company saw “high single-digit to low double-digit retail sales growth and strong inventory management” with several of its wholesale partners, including Dick’s Sporting Goods and speciality stores in North America. Nike also highlighted retailers such as JD Sports, Zalando and Sports Direct in EMEA and Topsports and Pou Sheng in Greater China.More from Footwear NewsManolo Blahnik Marks Milestone Year With 1M Euro Bonus for StaffNike Motiva Shoes Review: These New Walking Sneakers Are One of the Best Self-Care Purchases I've Made This YearIn the wake of the announcement on Thursday, several retail stocks — including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and Academy Sports and Outdoors — rallied on Friday morning, Seeking Alpha reported.“Overall, Nike’s results speak to an athletic footwear industry that is getting progressively healthier,” wrote BTIG analyst Janine Stichter in a note to investors last week.While DTC has been a top priority for Nike over the last few years, inventory excesses in prior quarters have led to an outsized growth in the wholesale channel as it offloads merchandise. Now, the company is narrowing its wholesale focus to specific retailers that connect members digitally and offer an elevated retail experience, Nike CEO John Donahoe said in a call with investors last week. For example, Nike will launch a connected membership program with Hibbett in October and the company touted a similar program it currently runs with Dick’s.“We think there’s a lot of growth opportunity with those strategic wholesale partners,” Donahoe said.Story continuesHowever, despite recent growth in these channels, Friend said that no single retailer makes up more than “a mid-single digit of Nike’s total business.”Notably, Nike also spotlighted its renewed partnership with Foot Locker, but said the brand expects “near-term sales declines as it invests in consumer-right concepts for the future.” According to Stichter, reduced Nike allocations to Foot Locker will put the company under pressure, but the retailer will likely benefit from Nike’s strong basketball shoe pipeline.“Basketball is where Foot Locker excels, and we expect Foot Locker’s Nike strategy go-forward to look to leverage its core competencies, with a deeper focus on basketball, kids, and ‘sneaker culture,'” Stichter wrote.Nike also highlighted its renewed focus on the running category, which appeared to bode well for competing footwear stocks like Deckers (which owns the fast growing Hoka brand) and On, the popular Swiss Running brand; both of those stocks also rallied after Nike’s earnings report last week.“We need to drive more meaningful consumer connections among everyday runners and scale these innovations more effectively across the marketplace,” Donahoe said in a call with investors.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Skechers has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Nike has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that SKX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics.

Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength AnalysisVF Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.35, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.9, which is worse than 95.13% of 903 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 15.63, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.19% of 768 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry.

One such stock that merits attention is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). The stock, which is currently priced at 16.99, recorded a loss of 3.85% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 6.51%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.8, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2, Altman Z-score of 1.35. These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Delving Into the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Snapshot of VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)VF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of VF's' ProfitabilityLet's delve deeper into VF's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 7.66; 2022: 7.45; 2023: 0.84, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Observing the financials of VF, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-133.9 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $117.12 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining VF's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.49; 2022: 1.33; 2023: 1.37, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that VF's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles.VF's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of VF's Altman Z-score reveals VF's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating VF's historical data, 2021: 0.02; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.00, we observe a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. This downward movement indicates VF's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of VF's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.11; 2023: 0.02) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that VF might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for VF is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in VF's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite the attractive valuation of VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) according to its GF Value, a deeper analysis of its financial health reveals several red flags. The company's low Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-score, along with declining profitability, increasing leverage, and deteriorating operational efficiency, suggest that VF may be a potential value trap. As such, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 3.76, the question arises: Is this stock significantly undervalued? This article aims to provide an in-depth valuation analysis of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), encouraging readers to delve deeper into the company's financial health and prospects.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PFE. Click here to check it out. PFE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PFEPfizer is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical firms, with annual sales close to $50 billion, excluding COVID-19 product sales. Historically, Pfizer sold many types of healthcare products and chemicals. However, prescription drugs and vaccines now account for the majority of sales. Top sellers include pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13, cancer drug Ibrance, and cardiovascular treatment Eliquis. Pfizer operates globally, with international sales representing close to 50% of its total sales. Within international sales, emerging markets are a major contributor.Unveiling Pfizer (PFE)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideSummarizing GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesThe stock of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is believed to be significantly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $ 33.94 per share, Pfizer stock is believed to be significantly undervalued.Because Pfizer is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Unveiling Pfizer (PFE)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid permanent capital loss, an investor must do their research and review a company's financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. Pfizer has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.69, which ranks worse than 55.05% of 1039 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The overall financial strength of Pfizer is 6 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Pfizer is fair.This is the debt and cash of Pfizer over the past years:Unveiling Pfizer (PFE)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthIt poses less risk to invest in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Pfizer has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $77.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.76. Its operating margin is 30.09%, which ranks better than 94.86% of 1031 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Pfizer at 9 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Pfizer is 34.4%, which ranks better than 90.61% of 916 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 29.6%, which ranks better than 76.65% of 878 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Pfizer's return on invested capital is 13.17, and its cost of capital is 7.22.The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of Pfizer is shown below:Unveiling Pfizer (PFE)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is believed to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 76.65% of 878 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

194,6b15c66b-df4c-39f0-89fd-ec2429c236df,PFE,2023-10-03,Years of research laid the groundwork for speedy COVID-19 shots,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/years-research-laid-groundwork-speedy-162407505.html,1696263847,STORY,"['MRNA', 'PFE', 'BNTX']","[The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded Monday to two scientists whose work led to the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.As countries prepared to roll out those shots, The Associated Press took a look at how the vaccines were developed so quickly. Below follows the original story, first published on Dec. 7, 2020.___How could scientists race out COVID-19 vaccines so fast without cutting corners? A head start helped -- over a decade of behind-the-scenes research that had new vaccine technology poised for a challenge just as the coronavirus erupted.“The speed is a reflection of years of work that went before,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, told The Associated Press. “That’s what the public has to understand.”Creating vaccines and having results from rigorous studies less than a year after the world discovered a never-before-seen disease is incredible, cutting years off normal development. But the two U.S. frontrunners are made in a way that promises speedier development may become the norm — especially if they prove to work long-term as well as early testing suggests.“Abject giddiness,” is how Dr. C. Buddy Creech, a Vanderbilt University vaccine expert, described scientists’ reactions when separate studies showed the two candidates were about 95% effective.“I think we enter into a golden age of vaccinology by having these types of new technologies,” Creech said at a briefing of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Both shots — one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, the other by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health — are so-called messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines, a brand-new technology. U.S. regulators are set to decide this month whether to allow emergency use, paving the way for rationed shots that will start with health workers and nursing home residents.Billions in company and government funding certainly sped up vaccine development — and the unfortunately huge number of infections meant scientists didn't have to wait long to learn the shots appeared to be working.Story continuesBut long before COVID-19 was on the radar, the groundwork was laid in large part by two different streams of research, one at the NIH and the other at the University of Pennsylvania — and because scientists had learned a bit about other coronaviruses from prior SARS and MERS outbreaks.“When the pandemic started, we were on a strong footing both in terms of the science"" and experience handling mRNA, said Dr. Tal Zaks, chief medical officer of Massachusetts-based Moderna.Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses — often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs — and then purifying them before next steps in brewing shots.The mRNA approach is radically different. It starts with a snippet of genetic code that carries instructions for making proteins. Pick the right virus protein to target, and the body turns into a mini vaccine factory.“Instead of growing up a virus in a 50,000-liter drum and inactivating it, we could deliver RNA and our bodies make the protein, which starts the immune response,” said Penn’s Dr. Drew Weissman.Fifteen years ago, Weissman’s lab was trying to harness mRNA to make a variety of drugs and vaccines. But researchers found simply injecting the genetic code into animals caused harmful inflammation.Weissman and a Penn colleague now at BioNTech, Katalin Kariko, figured out a tiny modification to a building block of lab-grown RNA that let it slip undetected past inflammation-triggering sentinels.“They could essentially make a stealth RNA,” said Pfizer chief scientific officer Dr. Philip Dormitzer.Other researchers added a fat coating, called lipid nanoparticles, that helped stealth RNA easily get inside cells and start production of the target protein.Meanwhile at the NIH, Dr. Barney Graham’s team figured out the right target — how to use the aptly named “spike” protein that coats the coronavirus to properly prime the immune system.The right design is critical. It turns out the surface proteins that let a variety of viruses latch onto human cells are shape-shifters — rearranging their form before and after they've fused into place. Brew a vaccine using the wrong shape and it won’t block infection.“You could put the same molecule in one way and the same molecule in another way and get an entirely different response,” Fauci explained.That was a discovery in 2013, when Graham, deputy director of NIH’s Vaccine Research Center, and colleague Jason McLellan were investigating a decades-old failed vaccine against RSV, a childhood respiratory illness.They homed in on the right structure for an RSV protein and learned genetic tweaks that stabilized the protein in the correct shape for vaccine development. They went on to apply that lesson to other viruses, including researching a vaccine for MERS, a COVID-19 cousin, although it hadn't gotten far when the pandemic began.“That's what put us in a position to do this rapidly,” Graham told the AP in February before the NIH’s vaccine was first tested in people. “Once you have that atomic-level detail, you can engineer the protein to be stable.""Likewise, Germany’s BioNTech in 2018 had partnered with New York-based Pfizer to develop a more modern mRNA-based flu vaccine, giving both companies some early knowledge about how to handle the technology.“This was all brewing. This didn’t come out of nowhere,” said Pfizer’s Dormitzer.Last January, shortly after the new coronavirus was reported in China, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin switched gears and used the same method to create a COVID-19 vaccine.Moderna also was using mRNA to develop vaccines against other germs including the mosquito-borne Zika virus -- research showing promise but that wasn’t moving rapidly since the Zika outbreak had fizzled.Then at the NIH, Graham woke up on Saturday Jan. 11 to see Chinese scientists had shared the genetic map of the new coronavirus. His team got to work on the right-shaped spike protein. Days later, they sent Moderna that recipe -- and the vaccine race was on.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

It expedites the development and review of drugs, and also grants seven years of post-approval marketing exclusivity.In June 2022, the FDA approved an investigational new drug application (IND), seeking to initiate a clinical study on TI-168 to treat hemophilia A patients with inhibitors. Following the approval, BXRX plans to initiate phase I/IIa study on TI-168 by early 2024.Hemophilia A is a rare genetic blood disorder which is caused by a missing clotting protein known as FVIII. The protein prevents normal blood from clotting. If the blood doesn’t clot properly, it can lead to painful bleeding inside the joints that can cause scarring and damage.Several other companies like Genentech (subsidiary of Roche [RHHBY]), Sanofi SNY and Pfizer PFE have developed or are developing treatment for hemophilia A.Roche’s Hemlibra (emicizumab) was the first approved treatment for the disease. Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody mimicking the action of FVIII. It is administered subcutaneously. Hemlibra continues to perform well and the drug is one of the top contributors to Roche’s sales growth. In the first half of 2023, RHHBY generated revenues of CHF 2.1 billion from the drug, indicating 20% growth year over year.Sanofi’sAltuviiio (efanesoctocog alfa), a new class of FVIII therapy for hemophilia A, was approved by the FDA in February 2023. The drug was launched in the United States in March 2023. Sanofi generated sales of 19 million euros from Altuviiio in the first half of 2023.Pfizer is developing its investigational anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, marstacimab, as a treatment for hemophilia A or B patients, without inhibitors to FVIII or Factor IX. In May, the company reported upbeat data from the phase III BASIS study that evaluated marstacimab for hemophilia A or B patients. The study met its primary endpoints, which showed that those treated with marstacimab achieved a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rate compared with the current standard-of-care treatment for hemophilia patients.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

197,f9db4dd8-9273-312a-8113-aca16b01436d,PFE,2023-10-03,ACM Research and Advance Auto Parts have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acm-research-advance-auto-parts-122500501.html,1696249500,STORY,"['AAP', 'ACMR', 'NVO', 'LLY', 'PFE']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 2, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares ACM Research ACMR as the Bull of the Day and Advance Auto Parts AAP as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Novo Nordisk NVO, Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:ACM Research, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), develops cleaning equipment that assists semiconductor companies in removing particles, contaminants, and other random defects during the manufacturing process. ACMR shares are widely outperforming the market this year with the backing of a leading industry group. The stock is hitting a series of 52-week highs and displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.The technology company is part of the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment – Material Services industry group, which ranks in the top 1% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. This industry has been steadily outperforming the market in 2023:Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionACM Research produces and sells single-wafer wet cleaning equipment for enhancing the manufacturing process and yield of integrated semiconductor chips. Its technology delivers megasonic energy at a microscopic level, providing cleaning for 2D and 3D patterned wavers.Story continuesThe company’s cleaning process uses less sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, providing more efficient performance for advanced metal plating. ACM Research sells its products under the Ultra C brand name through direct sales forces and third-party representatives.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesACMR has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in each of the last eight quarters. Back in August, the Fremont, California-based company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.48/share, a staggering 380% surprise over the $0.10/share consensus estimate. Earnings grew 118% year-over-year, while revenues of $144.58 million improved 38.5% from the year-ago quarter. ACMR has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 210.26%.Analysts covering ACMR are in agreement and have been increasing their earnings estimates as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have increased earnings estimates by 36.26% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.24/share, reflecting potential growth of 49.4% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to surge 44.39% to $561.4 million.Let’s Get TechnicalACMR shares have advanced nearly 135% this year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, ACMR is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, ACM Research has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and ACMR continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.Bottom LineThe future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. Momentum has picked up in recent months, even as the general market experienced a pullback. Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.Bear of the Day:Advance Auto Parts provides automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries, and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars, vans, utility vehicles, and trucks. The company offers a variety of products such as brakes and brake pads, engines and related parts, antifreeze and washer fluids, wiper blades, and tire repair accessories.Furthermore, Advance Auto Parts provides services such as battery installation, electrical system testing, and engine light scanning. The company serves do-it-yourself customers and professional installers through its website as well as retail stores in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and throughout the Caribbean. The Zacks RundownAdvance Auto Parts, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Automotive – Retail and Wholesale – Parts industry group, which ranks in the bottom 12% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the course of the year.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Despite the underperformance this year, stocks in this group remain relatively overvalued.As a part of this group, AAP stock has experienced considerable volatility in 2023. Shares recently hit a 52-week low following a disappointing earnings report and represent a compelling short or hedge opportunity.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating OutlookAAP has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the last three quarters. The auto parts company most recently reported second-quarter earnings back in August of $1.43/share, missing the $1.72/share consensus EPS estimate by 16.86%. Earnings plunged 61.8% from the same quarter in the prior year.Advance Auto Parts has missed earnings estimates by an average of 21.03% over the past four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and AAP is no exception.The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current quarter, analysts have decreased estimates by 28.36% in the past 60 days. The third-quarter Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.44/share, translating to negative growth of -49.3% relative to the same quarter last year.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAAP stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.While not the most accurate indicator, AAP stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Advance Auto Parts would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. AAP shares have fallen more than 64% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to go into overdrive anytime soon. The fact that AAP stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Shares continue to experience substantial volatility and have widely underperformed this year. With negative earnings estimate revisions continuing to pile up, this stock should be avoided as there are plenty of better alternatives in the current market environment.Additional content:3 Stocks to Focus on as Demand for Obesity Drugs BoomsThe market for obesity and weight management drugs is attracting a lot of interest lately in the United States. Patients are gradually understanding the benefits of obesity drugs like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide) — already approved for diabetes — could be the second drug for treating obesity, if it is approved for the indication by the FDA this year.The obesity drugs are designed in such a way that they suppress appetite so you eat less and eventually lose weight.According to the World Health Organization, over one billion people worldwide are obese. Obese people have a body mass index (BMI) above 30 while a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight. Obesity has become a global health problem as it can cause other diseases like heart disease, diabetes and stroke. This resulted in an exponential increase in demand for these obesity medicines. Also, social media has somewhat hyped the benefits of these medications.According to a Morgan Stanley report, the market for obesity drugs could reach $77 billion by 2030. Though supply issues may affect sales growth of these drugs in the near term, with the obesity market gaining popularity, analysts are expecting sales to increase. Pharma companies are rushing to enter the marketHere, we discuss three large drugmakers expected to gain the largest share of this fiercely growing market.Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk’s popular GLP-1 receptor agonist, Wegovy (semaglutide – 2.5 mg), is an anti-obesity injection. Wegovy is seeing strong prescription trends and is generating impressive revenues and profits for Novo Nordisk. In clinical studies, patients taking Wegovy have experienced an average loss of 15% of their body weight over a 68-week period. Wegovy sales were up 363% at a constant exchange rate (“CER”) in the first half of 2023.In August, Novo Nordisk reported positive data from the phase III SELECT study, which evaluated Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg) as an adjunctive treatment for preventing cardiovascular (“CV”) diseases in adults with overweight or obesity. Data from the study showed that Wegovy reduced the risk of major adverse CV events by 20%. Obesity is one of the major risk factors responsible for CV diseases. A weight-loss drug like Wegovy, which also has CV benefits, is expected to see increase in sales and demand.In addition, the CV benefit could probably make Wegovy eligible for insurance coverage. Currently, obesity drugs like Wegovy are considered lifestyle drugs and not eligible for coverage under Medicare health plans.Novo Nordisk is also evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with a potential FDA filing expected later this year. Novo Nordisk is also developing PYY 1875 for weight management in phase II studies.In August, Novo Nordisk also announced plans to acquire Canada’s private company Inversago Pharma, which makes CB1 receptor blocker therapies for obesity, diabetes and other serious metabolic diseases. CB1 is a cannabinoid receptor that plays an important role in appetite regulation and other cardiometabolic pathways. Inversago Pharma’s lead pipeline candidate, INV-202, an oral CB1 inverse agonist, demonstrated weight loss potential in an early-stage study.Eli LillyLilly reported strong data from obesity studies of its new drug Mounjaro (tirzepatide), a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Mounjaro is already approved for type II diabetes and is generating impressive sales. Mounjaro sales totaled $1.55 billion in the first half of 2023.Mounjaro showed a superior weight-loss reduction in clinical studies for the obesity indication. Regulatory applications have already been filed for Mounjaro for the obesity indication in the United States and EU. In the United States, the FDA has assigned priority review to the regulatory filing, with a decision expected by year-end.In addition, Lilly’s pipeline also includes retatrutide (GGG tri-agonist) and orforglipron, which are being developed, in late-stage studies, for type II diabetes and obesity.In August, Lilly acquired private biotech Versanis, which is expected to strengthen its position in the obesity market. Versanis’ lead pipeline candidate is bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody being developed in a phase IIb study alone and in combination with semaglutide in adults who are overweight or obese. Bimagrumab has the potential to show better quality weight loss by reducing fat mass while preserving muscle mass in people who are obese or have obesity-related complications.PfizerPfizer also has candidates for obesity in its pipeline even though it is behind competition. Pfizer is currently evaluating its oral, small molecule GLP-1-RA candidate danuglipron in a phase II study in patients with obesity and type II diabetes. Data from the phase II study is expected by the end of the year. If this study is successful, it will enable Pfizer to finalize the phase III plan.While Pfizer and Eli Lilly sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Novo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 72%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-nasdaq-pypl-120039539.html,1696334439,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies PayPal Holdings' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PayPal Holdings. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PayPal Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PayPal Holdings. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PayPal Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. PayPal Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 6.8% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PayPal HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PayPal Holdings, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$97m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in PayPal Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The regulator has also given firms the option of applying for a three-month extension to comply with the rules.While the FCA has tried to engage crypto firms serving U.K. clients about the promotions regime, it's ""concerned about a lack of engagement from some unregulated overseas firms,” said Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the regulator.""There are some [overseas firms] that have not engaged to the standard that we would expect and the provision of information back to us has been poor,” she added.Conversely, crypto firms like ByBit, Luno and payments platform PayPal, who recently announced they were halting certain services to the U.K. market in order to comply with the rules, received a nod of approval from the watchdog.“You will appreciate we can't comment on specific firms but what we can say is that, of course, where firms are making decisions to actually get to the standards we want to see, that's really positive,” said Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA.Meanwhile, the regulator is prepared to monitor firms' compliance and has the ability to scan 100,000 websites on a daily basis, said Castledine.Story continuesWhen firms don't comply, “we will issue warnings against those particular firms. We also have the ability to issue takedown requests ... and we've been working with the other big online tech platforms to make sure that illegal promotions don't actually appear in the first place,” Castledine said, adding that companies like Google are working to ensure paid financial promotions comply with FCA rules.Unauthorized ads or promotions could mean jail time, the FCA warned in February.The regulator will also have powers against overseas companies serving U.K. clients without registering with the FCA, but how they will handle them will vary case by case Castledine added. The regulator submits information on non-compliant firms to global watchdogs like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to be added to alert lists, she said.“That international response is quite key and quite critical for us and we're working very hard on those relationships,” Castledine said.Read more: UK Crypto Incentives Ban Could Drive Firms Out of Country, Lobbyists Say]"

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-trending-130010569.html,1696251610,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share, indicating a change of +13% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.61 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $7.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8%. The $29.7 billion and $32.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.9% and +9.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.43%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.01% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.67%.Heading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 5.16% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.63% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.45% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from IBM as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.13, up 17.68% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.82 billion, up 5.02% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.43 per share and revenue of $61.49 billion. These totals would mark changes of +3.29% and +1.58%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. IBM is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Investors should also note IBM's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 14.87. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 15.72, which means IBM is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that IBM has a PEG ratio of 3.56. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Integrated Systems industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.05 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 166, which puts it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) general manager of Asia Pacific, Paul Burton, spoke today, expressing his belief that there is a $10 trillion productivity to be reaped from AI if it is leveraged correctly. IBM is more focused on upgrading business operations with AI technology as opposed to merely offering a generally accessible tool. IBM aims to empower its clients to become AI creators so that with the help of IBM, their clients can use AI in a smart and trusted way. Back in May, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna stated that he expects about 7,800 back-office jobs at IBM to be replaced by AI over the next five years but that the potential for new work and job improvement will outweigh these downsides. On September 18th, IBM committed to providing AI training for two million workers, specifically from underrepresented communities, by the end of 2026.Unfortunately for Accenture, its earnings beat was overshadowed by the revenue miss and lower than expected guidance that pressured the stock 5% on Thursday. However, its stock rose 14% over the past 12 months, bringing the company market valuation of nearly $200 billion as it paves its way forward towards responsible AI innovations.Fiscal Fourth Quarter And Annual HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on August 31st , bookings fell 10% YoY to $16.6 billion despite consulting bookings surprisingly grew 1% but managed services contracted nearly 20%.The IT consulting and outsourcing company reported revenue rose 4% but the consulting business which accounts for 51% of the revenue contracted 2% with particularly weakened demand from communications, media and tech industries with revenue dropping as much as 12%. The Dublin-based company made a net income of $2.15 per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to to $2.71 per share, translating to a 4% rise.Story continuesFor the full year, Accenture made a profit of $6.87 billion, or $10.77 per share on the back of $64.11 billion in revenue.Fiscal First Quarter Guidance And 2024 OutlookFor the undergoing November quarter, Accenture guided for revenue in the range between $15.85 billion to $16.45 billion.The fiscal 2024 did not ease concerns about the weakened IT spending with the guidance of 2% to 5% revenue growth, with the mid-range being below analyst estimates of $67.2 billion which translate to 4.6% growth. Full-year adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.32, also coming short of estimates of $12.45.Weathering The SlowdownUnlike standalone consultancies or outsourcing firms, Accenture made itself into a one-stop shop as it goes beyond making IT strategies for its clients by supporting coders, designers and marketing throughout their execution paths. Accenture continues its expansion into digital marketing, blockchain, cloud computing services and cybersecurity products, while boosting its AI with the planned $3 billion investment.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

To skip our detailed analysis of the cloud computing industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy.Cloud Computing: An Area In Tech Worth Looking IntoThe information technology sector is one that has continued to exceed investor and analyst expectations during 2023. Developments such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI has primarily spearheaded the tech rally, bringing the stock prices for tech stocks higher than ever before. However, AI isn't the only area of tech that deserves investor attention at this moment. Another exciting field of development and investment is cloud computing, as individuals, corporations, and governments worldwide shift to a more digital future.According to tech experts and concerned professionals in the cloud computing space, this area of information technology is only just starting to grow. Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, joined CNBC in June 2022 to discuss this. Here are some of his comments from back then:""We've always said that in the fullness of time, it's possible that AWS could become the largest business at Amazon. Now Amazon has other large and great businesses and so it could take a while for us to get there, but I think that possibility is there. Essentially, IT is going to move to the cloud. It's gonna take a while, you've seen maybe only, call it 10% of IT today move to cloud. So it's still day one, it's still early.""Can Cloud Computing Grow To Greater Heights?Back then, Selipsky was noting that AWS was still in the course of its growth. A Bloomberg article from June 2022 later noted that this business alone was on track to achieve a $3 trillion valuation, which was almost three times its value back then, although it did not mention when this would be achieved. This is just one example of a cloud business that is expected to hit record highs in the near future. As the world is rapidly continuing to move towards the development of digital infrastructure, and as companies are committing themselves to move their information technology operations to the cloud, we can expect to see further growth and expansion in this market.Story continuesConsidering the above, cloud computing stocks such as Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), are among the top investments in the tech space for many investors and hedge funds alike as they continue to bet on the industry's drastic growth. We have compiled a list of some of the best cloud stocks to buy today so investors have a better idea of which companies are good bets for them as they head into 2024. These include some of the best pure-play cloud stocks out there today alongside others companies with a more diverse set of businesses.15 Best Cloud Computing Stocks Heading into 2024A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution.

The rapid emergence of AI-assisted software development tools can speed innovation, allowing companies to produce more, richer apps at lower cost. In addition, companies are deploying AI tools as sales and marketing enablers—helping with both prospect targeting and client service.

The company is seeing macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown spreading from technology, social media and cryptocurrency to retail and e-commerce. The other negative disclosure and a driver of this gross margin “miss” was that Twilio’s software sales are not accelerating at the rate that we expected. We are disappointed with this lower topline and low operating margin improvement guidance. The business transformation is taking longer than expected, and there is the heightened possibility that the new software growth could be stifled by more formidable competition as Twilio has made too many missteps.”13.

Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”6.

One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”Like Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 29 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 31, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.58 a share.MPC has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.23%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.20.MPC is part of a big group of Oils-Energy stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Devon Energy (DVN) as well.Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 7, 2023.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 4/10GF Value rank: 8/10Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned The AES Corp the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding The AES Corp BusinessThe AES Corp, with a market cap of $9.77 billion and sales of $12.95 billion, operates in the global power industry.

Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownThe AES Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health.

The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 10.65, which is worse than 98.67% of 452 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where The AES Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Over the past five years, The AES Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).

If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it indicates potential overvaluation or undervaluation, affecting its future return.Is The AES (AES) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, before making an investment decision, investors need to delve deeper. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, The AES (NYSE:AES) carries certain risk factors that should not be overlooked. Reflected primarily through its low Altman Z-score of 0.51, these indicators suggest that The AES, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-scoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968. It predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany Overview: The AES Corp (NYSE:AES)AES is a global power company with a generation portfolio consisting of over 32 gigawatts of generation, including renewable energy (46%), gas (32%), coal (20%), and oil (2%).

An analysis of The AES's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.03) indicates a declining trend.

(Photo: Lordstown Motors)The soap opera that is Lordstown Motors is taking yet another unusual turn. The company founder and former CEO is paying $10 million to buy the electric pickup maker’s assets out of bankruptcy.Lordstown’s “selling entities” said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday that Steve Burns made the only qualified bid for the assets. Burns founded the company in 2019 and brought it public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in 2020.Burns and former Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez left the company in June 2021 after an internal investigation found truth to a short seller’s allegations that Burns was responsible for inflating order estimates for the Endurance commercial pickup truck.“It’s just as doomed as ever,” Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for Guidehouse Insights, told FreightWaves on Monday. “I have no more confidence that Lordstown will gain any market traction than I did yesterday.”Lordstown manufactured and sold a few dozen trucks that were involved in two safety recalls. Its hope to carve out a piece of the commercial work truck space never materialized, especially in the face of competition from legacy automakers like Ford and even GM.Burns sold tens of millions in Lordstown sharesFollowing the SPAC merger with DiamondPeak Acquisition Corp. in October 2020, Burns had about 25% of the company stock. He began selling his shares as soon as a lockup expired. Burns eventually pocketed more than $60 million from share sales, including a large sell-off days before Lordstown filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June.It is unclear what assets Burns will get since the plant complex itself is owned by Taiwan’s Foxconn. The electronics giant, best known as a maker of Apple phones, purchased the complex from Lordstown for $230 million in May 2022. Foxconn obtained contract manufacturing rights to the Endurance as part of the plant purchase.According to the SEC filing, Burns’ entity LAS Capital “agreed to acquire specified assets of the selling entities related to the design, production and sale of electric light duty vehicles focused on the commercial fleet market.”Story continuesBurns did not immediately return a call from FreightWaves seeking comment.“There’s only soft tooling there. Maybe they could build a couple hundred more trucks, but that’s it,” Abuelsamid said. “And nobody’s going to buy them.”Burns paid $1 million into an escrow fund. If the deal does not go through this month, he could be on the hook for an additional $4 million.The Lordstown Endurance electric commercial pickup truck. (Photo: Lordstown Motors)A long shot to save Lordstown plantA former CEO of Workhorse Group, Burns in 2019 persuaded General Motors Co. to effectively give him its 6.2 million-square-foot complex in the northeast Ohio town of the same name. GM had built cars there from 1966 through March 2019 when it idled the plant.The fate of Lordstown became a political football when former President Donald Trump tweeted that GM CEO Mary Barra should find a new product for the plant. Trump won Ohio in the 2016 election in part because of labor support, including Mahoning Valley autoworkers.The UAW unsuccessfully bargained to keep the plant open. It was an issue in a 40-day national strike in September and October 2019. After the strike, GM agreed to lend Burns $20 million to retool the plant and carry a mortgage for him. It later invested $25 million in Burns’ venture. GM divested its interest in Lordstown in 2022.Related articles:Lordstown Motors files for bankruptcy, sues FoxconnLordstown Motors dodges Nasdaq delisting by reverse stock splitLordstown Motors closes plant sale to Taiwan’s FoxconnClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Lordstown Motors founder buys company assets out of bankruptcy appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Ford and VW did not immediately comment.The previously unreported letter asked the Department of Energy (DOE) to reconsider its plan to revise the ""Petroleum Equivalency Factor"" that will result in ""disproportionately higher compliance costs"" for U.S. automakers.Detroit's three automakers face $2,151 per vehicles in compliance costs compared with $546 per vehicle on average sold by other automakers, the letter said, and the policy ""would reward those auto manufacturers resisting the transition to a fully electric future the most.""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July proposed hiking CAFE standards by 2032 to a fleet-wide average of 58 miles per gallon by boosting requirements 2% per year for passenger cars and 4% annually for pickup trucks and SUVs.DOE wants to significantly revise how it calculates the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs in NHTSA's CAFE program.DOE on Monday noted that on Sept. 14 it sent letters to the Detroit Three and other automakers seeking comments about concerns about the effective date and risks vehicles would have lead time challenges.Story continues""Encouraging adoption of EVs can reduce petroleum consumption but giving too much credit for that adoption can lead to increased net petroleum use because it enables lower fuel economy among conventional vehicles,"" DOE said in April.A group representing nearly all major automakers said last week the industry as a whole could face $14 billion in CAFE fines.NHTSA did not immediately comment on Monday but previously said the estimate cited by automakers is ""consistent with our statutory obligations"" adding automakers ""are free to use electric vehicles to comply and avoid penalties altogether"".Automakers buy credits or pay fines if they cannot meet CAFE requirements. In June, Reuters first reported Stellantis and GM paid a total of $363 million in CAFE fines for failing to meet U.S. fuel economy requirements for prior model years.

The technology isn't perfect yet, but there are plenty of companies working on getting it there. No One at the Wheel: Driverless Cars and the Road of the Future author Samuel Schwartz and Wedbush Senior Equity Analyst Dan Ives share their thoughts on investing in the autonomous vehicle space.Schwartz highlights Alphabet's Waymo (GOOGL, GOOG) as being a company in the lead. Schwartz also points to General Motors' Cruise (GM), and Tesla (TSLA). However, Schwartz notes that one of the big problems for the industry is the ""lack of sharing of information and data,"" which means ""we don't know enough about how these vehicles are performing."" Schwartz estimates that it could take another 20 years for driverless vehicles to handle dirt roads or mountain roads, given that these vehicles can't yet do everything that one with a driver can.Ives compares the rise of driverless vehicles to what we're seeing in AI in that there will be ""derivative plays."" Ives makes the case for Uber Technologies (UBER) as a potential play because he believes ""not just one of five, but potentially two of every five Ubers, end of decade, could be self-driving, autonomous."" Ives echoes Schwartz's comments about GM's Cruise unit, saying it is a ""significantly undervalues asset"" at the automaker.For more from this episode of NEXT:Self-Driving Cars: The Road to Autonomy (full episode)How Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer will supercharge self-driving vehicle technologyNEXT: Driverless cars go mainstreamHow May Mobility is bringing self-driving cars to the streetsVideo Transcript- What are, in your mind, some of the big companies that play in this space that people should be on the lookout for?SAMUEL SCHWARTZ: Yeah, the big companies-- of course, Waymo is probably in the lead at the moment. And GM Cruise is certainly there. As Dan mentioned, Tesla, of course.But one of the problems with a lot of this industry is the lack of sharing of information and data. And so we really don't know enough about how these vehicles are performing.Story continuesAnd while I don't disagree that perhaps one out of five by the end of the decade will have some degree of autonomy-- and many of them, in fact, have some degree of autonomy right now, with Super Cruise and others. I just think it's going to be a little tougher for the average American to take a vehicle, perhaps without a steering wheel, when in fact, it can't do everything that a driver can do.I think we're probably 20 years away from being able to go on dirt roads, going on mountain roads, and other kinds of things. But for everyday driving, I think by the end of the decade, you're going to see quite a few. And one out of five is a pretty good estimate on the road.- Yeah, we have different levels of autonomy here, from things, like you said, Super Cruise to potential of robotaxis and things like that. So, Dan, putting your investor hat on, what do you think are some of the big plays here? Is it the automakers? Or is it even chip makers, like NVIDIA and companies like that?DAN IVES: Well, I think it's similar to what we've seen with AI. I mean, there's derivative plays from the chip perspective in terms of when you look at that ecosystem from a self-driving autonomous and who plays there. That's throughout Asia as well as the US, NVIDIA and others. They are going to be going after this market.But then ultimately, I think the first derivative, it's going to be the OEMs. I think that's where you look at Tesla. I think ultimately, Uber is actually a tangential play because we believe, not just one of five, potentially two of every five Ubers in the decade could be self-driving autonomous, basically no driver. And then you're going to look at the commercial side in terms of some of these commercial players.And I think Sam brings up GM. I do think that's really important. I think Cruise is a significantly undervalued asset at GM. And for anyone that's done any sort of test drives there in San Francisco, it's eye-popping in terms of that technology.]"

In constant currency, sales also grew 6%. Both comparisons include a 1% unfavorable impact attributable to a slower economic recovery in China.Operating income was $245 million in the third quarter compared to $235 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income was $251 million, a 5% increase from $239 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share was $0.63 in the third quarter as compared to $0.82 in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 compared to $0.69 in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations through the third quarter of 2023 was $660 million compared to $250 million in the year-ago period. For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its sales and operating profit outlook and increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook.President and CEO's Remarks Brendan M. Foley, President and CEO, stated, ""We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments, reinforcing the confidence that we have in our competitive advantages and differentiation. Our results reflect strong underlying business trends that were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding our Consumer segment in APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery has been slower than anticipated. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook and in the sustained trajectory of our business.""We drove 6% sales growth in the third quarter, reflecting continued effective price realization and an improvement in our underlying business volume trends.  Our performance underscores the strength of our brands and categories, as well as the power of our marketing, category management, differentiated customer engagement, and new products. In our Consumer segment, sales growth in the Americas and EMEA regions was partially offset by an unfavorable China impact. In Flavor Solutions, our exceptional performance continued, we delivered our tenth consecutive quarter of constant currency double-digit sales growth. Across our broad portfolio, we are continuing to capitalize on strong demand and deliver on our growth plans.Story continues""We drove significant improvement in our third quarter gross margin performance relative to last year. This improvement reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation that our pricing lagged last year as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. Our focus on increasing our profit realization is driving results.""As we look ahead, we remain committed to our long-term financial algorithm and driving sustained value creation through top line growth and margin expansion. We are excited about the opportunities for future growth in both segments to advance our leadership position and differentiation. We will continue to innovate and renovate and drive industry-leading brand marketing, customer engagement and category management. We will also diligently optimize our cost structure to drive long-term profitable growth.""Importantly, we will continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to build the next generation of leaders and capabilities. This is one of our most important commitments, as our teams around the world drive our momentum and success, and I am grateful for and energized by both their ongoing contributions and the results that they are driving. Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace.""Third Quarter 2023 ResultsMcCormick reported 6% sales growth in the third quarter from the year-ago period, with minimal currency impact. Constant currency sales growth reflected an 8% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume and mix decline attributable to the impact of a slower than expected economic recovery in China, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the Consumer business in Russia, and the Company's strategic decisions to discontinue low margin business. All other volume and product mix was flat to the third quarter of the prior year.Gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. This expansion was driven by pricing actions and cost savings led by the Company's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) and Global Operating Effectiveness (GOE) programs partially offset by cost inflation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from the year-ago period driven by an increase in employee incentive compensation expense as well as higher distribution and brand marketing costs partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings.Operating income increased to $245 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $235 million in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income was $251 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $239 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 5% from the year-ago period driven by the favorable impact of higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses.Earnings per share was $0.63 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.82 in the year-ago period. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.02 in the third quarter of 2023. The net favorable impact of the gain on the sale of the Kitchen Basics business and special charges increased earnings per share by $0.13 in 2022. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.69 in the year-ago period. This decrease was driven by the net impact of lapping the benefit of an optimization of the Company's debt portfolio in the third quarter of last year and the increase in income from unconsolidated operations driven by strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico.Net cash provided by operating activities through the third quarter of 2023 was $660 million compared to $250 million through the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Outlook For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its sales and operating income outlook, despite a lower than previously expected benefit from lapping the COVID-related disruptions in China. The Company increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook, driven by the strong year-to-date and projected performance of its joint venture, McCormick de Mexico.McCormick's broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio enables the Company to meet the rising demand for flavor around the world. The Company is capitalizing on the growing consumer interests in healthy and flavorful cooking, digital engagement, valuing trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. This, coupled with the breadth and reach of McCormick's portfolio and its proven strategies, positions the Company to sustainably continue its growth trajectory.McCormick continues to expect strong underlying business performance in 2023 driven by sales growth. The Company also expects a favorable impact to operating income from its GOE program and the lapping of the negative impact of the COVID-related disruptions in China in 2022, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and an expected increase in employee incentive compensation expenses given the anticipated improvement in underlying business performance. In addition, the Company expects earnings per share growth will be tempered by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate compared to 2022. Excluding this interest and tax headwind, McCormick's operating performance growth is expected to be strong. The Company expects minimal impact on net sales, operating income, and earnings per share from currency rates in 2023.In 2023, McCormick expects to grow sales by 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The Company expects sales growth to be driven primarily by pricing actions which, in conjunction with cost savings, are expected to offset inflationary pressures. McCormick also expects to drive continued growth through the strength of its brands, as well as brand marketing, new products, category management, and differentiated customer engagement plans.Operating income in 2023 is expected to grow by 11% to 13% from $864 million in 2022. The Company anticipates approximately $55 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previously announced organizational and streamlining actions. Excluding the impact of special charges and integration expenses in 2023 and 2022, adjusted operating income is expected to increase 10% to 12%.McCormick projects 2023 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.46 to $2.51, compared to $2.52 of earnings per share in 2022. The Company expects special charges to lower earnings per share by $0.16 in 2023. Excluding special charges, the Company projects 2023 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.67, as compared to previously reported guidance of $2.60 to $2.65 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 in 2022. The increase from previous guidance reflects an updated expectation of the contribution from the Company's joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. The year-over-year expected increase of 4% to 6% reflects strong operating performance, partially offset by an 8% headwind from higher interest expense due to the higher interest-rate environment and lapping the impact of an optimization of the Company's debt portfolio last year, as well as a 1% headwind from an anticipated increase in the Company's projected adjusted effective tax rate. For fiscal 2023, the Company expects strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and anticipates returning a significant portion of cash flow to shareholders through dividends.Business Segment Results Consumer Segment(in millions)Three months endedNine months ended8/31/20238/31/20228/31/20238/31/2022Net sales$        937.1$        927.9$     2,758.7$      2,720.1Operating income, excluding special charges173.3183.7500.3475.5Consumer segment sales increased 1% from the third quarter of 2022, with minimal currency impact, reflecting a 5% increase from pricing actions partially offset by lower volume of 4%.

These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:Special charges – In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned ""Special charges"" in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses and income associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Expenses associated with the approved actions are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion.Transaction and integration expenses – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as ""Transaction and integration expenses"", include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventories.Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics - We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of the Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. As more fully described in note 17 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022, the pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million and is included in Other income, net in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2022.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures is provided below:(in millions except per share data)Three Months EndedNine Months Ended8/31/20238/31/20228/31/20238/31/2022Operating income$  245.0$ 235.2$ 665.8$ 599.3Impact of transaction and integration expenses———2.2Impact of special charges (1)6.13.447.138.0Adjusted operating income$  251.1$ 238.6$ 712.9$ 639.5% increase versus year-ago period5.2 %11.5 %Adjusted operating income margin (2)14.9 %15.0 %14.5 %13.7 %Income tax expense $    42.7$   59.3$ 117.4$ 115.4Impact of transaction and integration expenses———0.6Impact of special charges (1)1.30.711.010.7Impact of sale of Kitchen Basics—(11.6)—(11.6)Adjusted income tax expense$    44.0$   48.4$ 128.4$ 115.1Adjusted income tax rate (3)21.4 %21.2 %21.8 %20.0 %Net income$  170.1$ 222.9$ 461.3$ 496.3Impact of transaction and integration expenses———1.6Impact of special charges (1)4.82.736.127.3Impact of after-tax gain on sale of Kitchen Basics—(38.0)—(38.0)Adjusted net income$  174.9$ 187.6$ 497.4$ 487.2% increase (decrease) versus year-ago period(6.8) %2.1 %Earnings per share - diluted$    0.63$   0.82$   1.71$   1.83Impact of transaction and integration expenses———0.01Impact of special charges (1)0.020.010.130.10Impact of after-tax gain on sale of Kitchen Basics—(0.14)—(0.14)Adjusted earnings per share - diluted$    0.65$   0.69$   1.84$   1.80% increase (decrease) versus year-ago period(5.8) %2.2 %(1)Special charges for the nine months ended August 31, 2022 include a $10.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge associated with our exit of our business operations in Russia.

Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed ""on a constant currency basis"", is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

It's a big week for economic data, the September jobs report. That's on tap. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins us for a breakdown of what's to come this week and the excitement level that we should have kicking things off. Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. We'll go 7 out of 10 this week. All right? We're pretty excited. There was--BRAD SMITH: Oh, wow.JOSH SCHAFER: Of course. Well, we thought at one point we were gonna get this jobs report on Friday, or at least I thought at one point we weren't gonna get this jobs report on Friday. That's a large part of what I do here, Brad. I like being busy. And so we do have this calendar now filled out for the week.And you take a look there, you see a lot of updates on the labor market. That's really your story of the week here when you think about that jobs report on Tuesday, jobs report on Friday, also some interesting data out this morning, though, as far as ISM factory picking up. We're going to get a look at services on Wednesday.On the corporate side, not a very busy week. But I'm interested to see what we hear from Tilray on Wednesday. We know cannabis stocks have been hot with legalization maybe heating up a little bit there as far as SAFE Banking goes. And then also Levi's and Constellation will be interesting to follow on Thursday.But again, the real story of the week here is that jobs report, so I just wanna give you guys, again, the numbers at least as of Monday for what we're expecting. We're expecting nonfarm payroll additions of 168,000, unemployment rate of 3.7%, and an average hourly wages of 4.3% So that unemployment rate would come down just a little bit from 3.8% last quarter.And that's gonna be something that's interesting to watch because, remember, we had that big tick up in the unemployment rate from 3.5 to 3.8 with the August jobs report. And that was an interesting thing to see because it really what it told us if there was more people coming back to the labor market looking for work. Do we still see that developing during this report is gonna be something I'm watching for on Friday.]"

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces a potential challenge to his leadership this week, though it isn’t clear how much support there would be for such a move.Investors are turning their attention to the start of the new month and quarter and the big slate of jobs data due out this week, including the latest reading on the number of job openings, due out Tuesday morning, followed by a report on growth in private payrolls, unemployment claims data for last week, both later this week, and Friday’s jobs report for September.The jobs report comes as the Federal Reserve weighs whether to raise interest rates another time this year as it continues to battle inflation. Despite signs that prices are cooling, the labor market has held up. Analysts are expecting the economy added fewer jobs last month than the month before, but they are also anticipating a slight tick lower in the unemployment rate.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Job openingsThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey is due out at 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT). Analysts are expecting a reading of 8.8 million job openings as of the last day of August, about the same as the prior month.2.

226,d7737705-7ad8-34ee-a9a5-057016e50279,MKC,2023-10-03,"Conagra's (CAG) Frozen & Snacks Strength Aids, High Costs Ail",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conagras-cag-frozen-snacks-strength-133300301.html,1696253580,STORY,"['CAG', 'USFD', 'SYY', 'MKC-V', 'FLO']","[Conagra Brands, Inc.’s CAG frozen and snacks categories are thriving, driven by its commitment to innovation. Though costs associated with these innovations pose a threat to profits, the company’s justified pricing actions have been offering relief.Focus on Frozen and Snacks DivisionsConagra's innovation efforts have been concentrated on the frozen and snacks categories, both of which have shown remarkable growth over the past four years. On its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management stated that the frozen and snacks categories have improved 9% and 8%, respectively, over the past four years. Together, these categories form about 70% of the company’s domestic retail dollar sales.Growth in the frozen category reflects the strength of the company’s brands and the effective execution of the Conagra Way playbook. In the fourth quarter, Conagra saw an improved share in multi-serve meals, frozen sides and frozen breakfast sausages. During fiscal 2023 (a year of considerable pricing), seven out of the company’s top 10 frozen product categories either held or increased unit share.Moving to snacks, Conagra’s two biggest snacking platforms — meat snacks and microwave popcorn — witnessed increased unit share in fiscal 2023. Management expects fiscal 2024 results to benefit from the company’s investments in innovation in these categories.Cost Woes, an Industry ChallengeConagra faced cost inflation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The adjusted gross margin was adversely affected by the increased costs of goods sold, including unfavorable commodity positions, and an unfavorable operating leverage. Management anticipates the net cost of goods sold inflation of nearly 3% in fiscal 2024.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, excluding advertising and promotional costs, surged 24.3% to $301 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher incentive compensations and increased investments in the supply chain and technology. Advertising and promotional costs also increased substantially, reaching $69 million, up by 49.7% compared to the year-ago quarter. Management foresees continued investments in advertising and promotional activities and SG&amp;A in fiscal 2024 to support ongoing innovation efforts.Other players like McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, Sysco Corporation SYY and Flowers Foods, Inc. FLO have also been grappling with cost inflation.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, McCormick’s adjusted gross margin was somewhat offset by escalated cost inflation. Further, MKC’s SG&amp;A expenses increased year over year due to elevated employee incentive compensation expenses and increased distribution costs. McCormick also witnessed a spike in brand marketing costs in the second quarter and expects an even greater year-over-year rise in brand marketing costs in the third quarter.Sysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, SYY witnessed product cost inflation of 2.1% for the overall company, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the frozen, canned and dry categories. Apart from this, adjusted operating expenses rose 1.9%. Sysco anticipates its International segment to remain inflationary in fiscal 2024.Flowers Foods continued to be impacted by input cost inflation, reduced production volumes, higher product returns and elevated maintenance costs in the second quarter of 2023. FLO expects inflation to persist in 2024. Additionally, FLO witnessed a rise in marketing expenses in the second quarter of 2023. The company’s adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative expenses expanded 70 basis points to 38.2% of sales. Flowers Foods’ increased focus on marketing and innovation behind brands is likely to increase its cost burden in the near term.Story continuesPricing Offers Respite to ConagraConagra has successfully navigated cost challenges through its pricing initiatives. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed a 9.9% improvement in the price/mix, which contributed to 2.2% growth in organic sales. This was attributed to Conagra's strategic pricing actions in response to inflation.Across various segments, the price/mix exhibited strong growth, with increases of 9.1%, 10.4%, 13.8% and 9.3% in the Grocery &amp; Snacks, Refrigerated &amp; Frozen, International and Foodservice sectors, respectively. The continuation of these strategies is expected to benefit Conagra going forward, with fiscal 2024 organic net sales projected to rise around 1% year over year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

227,e142c5b6-79a9-3136-86d7-175aadefb18c,MKC,2023-10-03,Kraft Heinz (KHC) Poised on Pricing & Transformation Efforts,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kraft-heinz-khc-poised-pricing-132500991.html,1696253100,STORY,"['KHC', 'HRL', 'MKC-V', 'K-WI']","[The Kraft Heinz Company KHC is on track with undertaking sustainable pricing actions to drive growth. The iconic consumer packaged food and beverage company is focused on transforming its business to unleash its full potential. To this end, management is accelerating its strategic plan and augmenting its geographic presence.Let’s delve deeper.Pricing Actions SolidSolid pricing initiatives have been aiding Kraft Heinz for a while now. In second-quarter 2023, the company’s pricing rose 11 percentage points, reflecting higher list prices. In the North America and International segment, pricing increased 9.4 and 16.5 percentage points, respectively. Robust pricing efforts boosted the company’s quarterly net sales, which increased 2.6%. Management expects an adjusted gross margin expansion, driven by pricing and gross efficiencies, in 2023.What Else is Working Well for Kraft Heinz?Kraft Heinz is committed to accelerating its profit and enhancing the long-term shareholders’ value. As part of its next transformation phase, management unveiled AGILE@SCALE in February 2022. The strategy has been helping Kraft Heinz to enhance its agile expertise and capabilities via partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators. The company has been focused on Revenue Management initiatives via proprietary digital solutions. The company is on track to deliver solutions in its value chain to accelerate growth and drive efficiencies.  KHC is on track with managing its portfolio and accelerating its strategic plan, augmenting geographic presence and increasing focus on growth areas. Keeping this in mind, Kraft Heinz offloaded its B2B powdered cheese business to Kerry Group in the second half of 2022. In November 2021, the company concluded the sale of certain assets in the global cheese business along with the license of specific trademarks to an affiliate of Groupe Lactalis.Meanwhile, the company undertakes strategic acquisitions to increase its presence. In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Certainly, Kraft Heinz’s solid growth efforts and strategic pricing actions will certainly sustain its growth momentum.Story continuesOther Food Stocks Benefiting From BuyoutsSeveral other companies in the food space, like Kellogg Company K, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.Kellogg acquired protein bar maker Chicago Bar Company in 2017. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, considered one of the fastest-growing nutrition bar brands in the United States. K’s Pringle's buyout has been lucrative. With the Pringles deal, Kellogg transformed itself from a large U.S. snacks business to a true global snacks player.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, HRL announced its acquisition of a minority stake in Indonesia-based food and beverage company PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk. The move will likely help Hormel Foods expand its presence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. In June 2021, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz.McCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-added offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Air Canada last month purchased 18 Dreamliners and Air France-KLM ordered 50 Airbus A350s. Since the pandemic, there has also been a rise in demand for narrowbody jets, especially larger models such as the A321, which has dominated the single-aisle market.Among U.S. airlines, higher-margin international travel is the most important to United, accounting for about 39% of its passenger revenue this year - up from before the pandemic.United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said the company expects a disproportionate part of its growth in the second half of this decade to come from global long-haul flying.""In the future, United will increasingly turn to global growth to expand,"" he told reporters on a conference call.The latest order is the second major aircraft purchase by United over the past year. It unveiled a huge order of 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 100 737 MAXs in December.“United’s unprecedented commitment to the 787 Dreamliner family is a testament to the market-leading operating economics and reliability of Boeing’s widebody jets,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.Story continuesAirbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said the A321's fuel efficiency, smaller carbon footprint and lower maintenance and operating costs will be a ""game changer"" for United.BACKLOGSCarriers have been placing orders with urgency as Boeing and Airbus backlogs have grown and as jet deliveries have been pushed out toward the end of the decade.Nocella called the situation ""a bit frustrating"" as the planes ordered by the company are ""significantly"" behind schedule.Meanwhile, limitations on runways, airspace and gate capacity at the nation's largest airports have compelled airlines to cut departures.United aims to get around the problem by flying larger planes with more seats. It expects average seats per departure in North America to increase by 40% in 2027 from the pre-pandemic period.The large 787 order is likely to raise further questions about the future of outstanding United orders for 45 Airbus A350s which have already been deferred to at least 2030.Nocella said that while the A350 is a ""great machine"" and there is no change in the company's order, United is focused on its 787 fleet in the short run. It plans to deploy the 787 jets on the routes that Boeing's 767 is flying today, he said.""It's doing great for United around the globe,"" he said.The latest order comes at a time when weakening pricing power in the U.S. market has sparked concerns about the strength of travel demand.

UAL announced the launch of a new United Military Pilot Program. This industry-leading program will be giving full-time, active-duty U.S. military pilots access to conditional job offers as First Officers with the airline.Per terms of this new launch, successful candidates must first take part in an interview and then complete all required flight training and certification prior to joining the airline. An important element of UAL's program is that candidates don't need to be holders of an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP) at the time of application. Instead, they can get their ATP before joining the airline.United Airlines CEO, Scott Kirby, stated, “Launching this program is a win-win: our airline gets direct access to some of the best, most talented aviators in the world, and military pilots – and their families – get the time they need to plan their civilian career while still serving”.Currently, United Airlines has over 16,000 pilots (including over 3,000 who have served or currently serving in the United States Armed Forces). UAL employs nearly 7,700 military veterans and 1,500 actively serving personnel across various departments and functions, including many serving in leadership and executive positions.Introduction of such programs is a welcome development as it provides a secure landing place while they complete their service to the nation and work toward meeting all UAL’s hiring requirements.Zacks RankUAL currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are GATX Corporation GATX and Ryder System R.GATX, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has strengthened its railcar leasing operations.

238,c5e5c63a-0b93-3850-a1b0-50115c4db394,TGT,2023-10-03,"Student loan repayments start: Here's what you should do first, says one economist",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/student-loan-repayments-start-heres-183923272.html,1696271963,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'TGT']","[Student loan repayments resume this month and many borrowers will need to figure out how to adjust their budgets and spending habits. Thomas Simons, Jefferies U.S. Economist joins Yahoo Finance live to shed light on the next steps to take. Simons advises looking into loan services and being aware of what servicer has assumed the loan. Simons also advises looking for government assistance to find a way to “ease your way” back into loan repayment.In terms of consumer trends—Simons predicts certain “discounters” such as Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) will “pick up the slack” in terms of where borrowers will shop in order to save money.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: What should people do in terms of their first checklist of what to do if they have student loans and they really haven't thought about them over the past couple of years?THOMAS SIMONS: Yeah, I mean, that's a really significant issue. I believe I've seen statistics that are kind of all over the place on how much servicer turnover has gone on, but even some of the bigger payment processors from before are no longer handling the debt the way they were before. So absolutely, first thing to do is the check in with who you were, you know, servicing your loan through and see if there's information about who has assumed your loan, see what their terms are, and make sure that all the automatic payment drafting structure is in place.But also, on your own budgeting side, be prepared to figure out how to carve out this extra money from your monthly flow, and make sure also to take a look at what options are available from the government in order to sort of ease back into payments. This is one of the things that Biden was able to get through in the whole rigmarole over the spring with the student loan issue was that there are modification programs that are much more-- much, you know, easier to follow up with and much more successful, probably will be much more successful, I should say, than previous versions.Story continuesAnd also, if you are unable to pay for a month or two, there's-- you know, that late payment isn't going to be reported to a credit agency for a whole year. Thing to keep in mind is that if you are not paying, that you are accruing interest and your balance is going to grow. It's not like it was in 2020 and through 2022, when the interest moratorium was in place.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I mean, and people might not know that interest started kicking in and accruing September 1st, so even though student payments are coming up, that interest already continuing to accrue. I do want to ask you, though, some of the big winners. Obviously we know that as people are going to have to pull back on some of their discretionary spending, you know, won't have as much to spread around, what about some of the companies that benefit from this resuming?THOMAS SIMONS: So there was a lovely graphic that we had on a few minutes ago about a couple of the companies that we've upgraded here at Jefferies, and, really, I think for my own personal view, and I should say I'm not an equity analyst, nor am I specific to single names here, but I do think that the discounters are the ones that are probably going to pick up most of the slack, right? So, I mean, it's Walmart, Target, TJ Maxx like you have there. They will benefit in that big trade down.You know, Costco is an interesting one, because I know that their membership tends to be mostly college graduates. You know, they-- for whatever reason, they just tend to like shopping there, but, you know, I don't know if that means that there's maybe some risk within their customers, but certainly, if they're just trading down brands, you know, discounter and bulk shopping should be doing better as well, I would think.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you would think so, especially the timing of still have high interest rates, people trying to save for homes, certainly a whole perfect storm here of issues here for consumers and borrowers. I appreciate you taking the time to join us. Thomas Simons, Jefferies US economist. Thanks so much.THOMAS SIMONS: Of course. Thank you.]"

The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target TGT, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.Eric Bunyan, the senior vice president of Leasing, East Region, for Macerich, emphasized the significance of these developments. He stated, “The tremendous success of the new Target at Kings Plaza, combined with strong performance for Primark, Zara and Burlington, each of which have been open since 2018 in the former Sears location, demonstrates the power and promise of Kings Plaza, Macerich’s well-located, fully enclosed retail center in Brooklyn.”Bunyan's enthusiasm is well-founded as these national brands selecting Kings Plaza underscore its appeal to diverse demographics, including affluent shoppers from the dynamic trade area.Macerich's approach to leasing, which focuses on creating properties that cater to a broader range of consumer needs, has proven effective. The addition of popular brands like Shake Shack and Ashley Furniture further enhances the shopping experience. Moreover, Macerich is exploring opportunities for a 50,000-square-foot location at the prime corner of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Recent improvements, such as brightening and lightening the attached parking deck, along with upgrades to lighting, furnishings and flooring on the center's second level, have further solidified Kings Plaza as one of the most successful shopping centers in the market.Kings Plaza, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and dining destination with a 10-level parking garage, has an impressive lineup of tenants, including Target, Primark, Zara, Burlington, Lowe's, Ashley Furniture, Sephora and many others. This diverse mix of retailers caters to a wide range of consumer preferences, making Kings Plaza a go-to destination for shopping and dining.Nevertheless, dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

These initiatives have played a pivotal role in driving membership signups and renewals, leading to a surge in membership fee income.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, membership fee income witnessed a year-over-year increase of 5%, fueled by strong renewal rates and successful membership acquisition. We foresee a sustained improvement in membership fee income as new club openings ramp up.BJ's Wholesale Club has been directing resources toward expanding digital capabilities to better engage with members and provide them with a convenient way to shop, including same-day delivery, curbside pick-up and buy online, pick up in-club.

It also rolled out Same-Day Select, through which members, on payment of an upfront fee, can avail of either unlimited or a set number of same-day grocery deliveries delivered in as little as two hours.Management believes that digitally engaged members have higher average baskets and make more trips per year than members who shop in-club only. Digitally enabled comparable sales rose 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Clubs fulfill approximately 90% of digitally enabled sales.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that BJ's Wholesale Club’s growth strategies, better price management, decent membership trends and digitization should keep supporting comparable sales trends.As part of its long-term financial targets, BJ’s Wholesale Club projected a low-to-mid-single-digit-percentage increase in comparable club sales, excluding the impact of gasoline sales. The company, which shares space with Costco COST, Walmart WMT and Target TGT, guided total revenue growth of a mid-single-digit percentage. It expects a high-single-to-low-double-digit-percentage increase in earnings per share in the long run.A Synopsis of Other StocksCostco continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. A customer-centric approach, strategic pricing, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have helped Costco post consistent sales growth.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: On Semiconductor ON, Ross Stores ROST and Constellation Energy Corp. CEG.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:A Nonfarm Payroll Week: Global Week AheadOn Friday, we get closely-watched U.S. jobs data.In the Global Week Ahead, thankfully, there won’t be a U.S. federal gov’t shutdown, led by the U.S House of Representatives. But a Ukraine military funding bill must still pass.In the Asia-Pacific region, real estate developer China Evergrande remains on the brink.Also helping to kick off the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, there are central bank meetings in Australia, New Zealand and Poland.This happens while stock and bond markets still adjust to central banks' higher-for-longer rates mantra.Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) The third quarter ends, and the fourth quarter begins.Markets kick off the all-important final quarter of the year after a game-changer of a last few months, driven largely by a +30% surge in oil prices.Higher rates mean U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds — often the main ballast of portfolios — have cost investors between 5.5% and 6.5% in Q3.Even gold has lost its shine, meaning that the U.S. dollar has really been the only safety play in town.Equity bulls have also been biffed. World stocks are still up a respectable +8% for the year but have given back almost -5% in September with even the global tech giants reversing.Q4, though, will bring another earnings season, and while the AI boom still matters, analysts will be ultra-focused on the what the traditional economy players say about the cost pain or lack of it that their customers are now feeling.Story continues(2) Will the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reach 5.0%?Just how high government bond yields climb is on the watch list after yet another market sell-off.The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen to 4.6%, its highest level since the October 2007, as investors absorb the Federal Reserve message that rates will stay high until inflation is quashed.That has also steepened yield curves sharply, as long-dated bond yields are rising much faster than shorter-dated ones.The yield surge has hammered stocks and helped push the dollar to its highest in almost a year.INGreckons a 5.0% handle on U.S. Treasury yields and 3.0% for 10-year German Bunds are ""looking more probable by the day.”At around 2.9%, German yields are near their highest levels since 2011.(3) Political damages to assess from Washington DC?The world's No.1 economy was on the brink of another possible government shutdown.That could have damaged its credit rating further, exacerbated stock market volatility, and delayed economic releases, including the key Oct. 6th jobs report.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would have been furloughed, and a wide range of services would have paused, if Congress had not passed this 45-day funding legislation. Democratic President Joe Biden signed it into law by midnight on Saturday Sept. 30th.Still, the lack of Ukrainian funding in the stopgap bill is further evidence of how political polarization in Washington is weakening fiscal policymaking, Moody's says.Investors will now get timely updates on the economy from the U.S. Federal government.Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy has created +150K jobs in September versus +187K in August.Stronger-than-expected data would likely bolster the 'higher for longer' rates stance that is hurting bonds and stocks.(4) A new Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor.The Reserve Bank of Australia's new governor, Michele Bullock — the first woman to head the bank — chairs her first meeting on Tuesday.Investors will be looking for signals from Bullock, known as a straight-talker, on whether the RBA is done with hikes or if more might be coming after some signs of inflation smoldering in the services sector.The consensus is for a pause.China is another risk for Australia's economy, of course: a property sector teetering on the edge of collapse flashes red lights for Australian raw material exports.The window into what Beijing is doing to prop up the sector — if anything — will basically be shut next week, given the Golden Week holiday.Meanwhile, New Zealand's Reserve Bank meets on Wednesday. Despite a hawkish bias, a hike is viewed as a long shot.The focus is on any signals for a possible November move.(5) The Polish central bank meets.In early September, Poland's central bank governor Adam Glapinski stunned markets.He delivered a much larger than expected 75-basis point rate cut to 6% for emerging Europe's biggest economy, where inflation is still in double digits.The move sent the zloty sharply lower and came at a tense time for Poland, which heads to the polls on Oct. 15th.With the cost of living a key election battleground, the drastic cut brings relief to those struggling with mortgage repayments.But it also adds to pressure on the fiscal side combined with a deluge of election promises featuring generous spending commitments across the political spectrum, fanning concerns over the outlook for inflation.On Wednesday, policy makers meet to decide the next step in interest rates.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks(1) On Semiconductor: This is a $94 stock in the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry.

This company, which is in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this global payments processor has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.23%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Visa was expected to post earnings of $2.11 per share, but it reported $2.16 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.37%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.97 per share, while it actually produced $2.09 per share, a surprise of 6.09%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Visa lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Visa currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.02%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

V provided an update to its dispute program for first-party fraud or friendly fraud, for card-not-present transactions. The move is expected to help merchants fight first-party misuse, saving small businesses more than billions in losses worldwide in the next half a decade. The improvement is expected to benefit the consumer-merchant ecosystem.In current market conditions, small businesses are fighting hard for their margins. As such, the rule change is expected to provide them some impetus, helping them keep their rightfully earned money. With rising digital transactions over the past few years, fraud activities have dramatically surged. First-party misuse is just one universe in the multiverse of fraud activities.The move highlights Visa’s focus on minimizing the impact of fraud and protecting consumers and merchants. The company’s investments in ensuring the security of payment solutions are enabling it to advance its digital platform. This has been spotlighted by the company in multiple instances over the past few months as the regulators and legislators have been talking about increasing competition in the payment space (Credit Card Competition Act bill).Visa and Mastercard Incorporated MA are right at the center of this debate. The primary argument against increasing competition has been that it can affect the level of security. The supply of better and more effective security technologies and related R&amp;D comes with expensive price tags, which will likely be difficult for smaller rivals to cough up right from the beginning.There are other competitors in the payments space providing digital banking products and credit payment services, including American Express Company AXP and Discover Financial Services DFS, with comparatively lower market share. These companies provide their respective unique financial products to capture market share.American Express offers lines of credit to small businesses and invests in technological improvements to bring in more customers and boost volumes. Discover Financial uses in-house resources and third-party vendors to pursue technology advancements. It is witnessing volume growth in its Payment Services business, which is supporting its results.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnderstanding the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.5. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.What is the Altman Z-score?Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewMarathon Digital Holdings Inc focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. The company's cryptocurrency machines are located in the United States.Is Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapKey Drivers of Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals Marathon Digital Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The first factor we need to consider is a measure of short-term liquidity. This is calculated as the working capital divided by total assets. When we evaluate the data provided: 2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00, it's clear that Marathon Digital Holdings has experienced a declining trend in its Working Capital to Total Assets ratio over the past few years. This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. The ratio is strikingly low, which unfavorably influences the overall Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Marathon Digital Holdings's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates a recent dip following an initial rise. This reduction suggests that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) might be a potential value trap due to its low Altman Z-Score and declining financial health. Thorough due diligence and careful consideration of these risk factors are crucial before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But in 2022 — when the benchmark S&amp;P 500 tumbled nearly 20% — many investors learned the hard way that stocks don't always go up.In the unpredictable stock market, investors may find solace in the steady rhythm of dividends.With the right dividend stocks, investors can bypass the stress and uncertainty associated with attempting to time the market, all while benefiting from a passive income stream.Business magnate John D. Rockefeller once said, ""Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It's to see my dividends coming in.""Don’t Miss:Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.But most companies don't pay much these days. The average dividend yield of S&amp;P 500 companies is now just 1.6%.Still, some companies offer a far more generous yield. Here's a look at two stocks Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) finds especially appealing — both boasting yields of over 8%.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Telecommunications is an essential service, meaning demand remains relatively consistent regardless of economic conditions.Verizon is one of the biggest players in the telecom arena, generating $136.8 billion in revenue in 2022. The company also has a track record of paying dividends consistently and increasing them over time.In the first half of 2023, Verizon paid shareholders $5.5 billion in dividends.Last month, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66.5 cents per share, representing a 1.9% increase from its previous payout. This marked Verizon's 17th consecutive annual dividend hike.Story continuesAt the current share price, the new dividend rate translates to an annual yield of 8.2%.Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery has an Overweight rating on Verizon and a price target of $44. Considering that shares were trading at $32.41 last week, the price target implies a potential upside of 36%.Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)Energy Transfer owns one of the largest portfolios of energy assets in the U.S.With approximately 125,000 miles of pipelines and associated energy infrastructure, the partnership has a strategic network that spans 41 states and all of the major production basins in the country.In July, Energy Transfer announced a quarterly cash distribution of 31 cents per unit. At the current unit price, the amount comes out to an annual yield of 8.9%.In the second quarter, Energy Transfer's distributable cash flow (DCF) attributable to its partners totaled $1.55 billion. In the earnings conference call, Energy Transfer Co-CEO Tom Long pointed out that the amount ""resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $579 million.""The stock has climbed 20% in 2023, and Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Kad sees further upside on the horizon.

259,477f27d2-ede6-3a5d-8ad8-a298a71fce7b,SWK,2023-10-03,Don’t Miss the Boom: 7 Dividend Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-miss-boom-7-161511477.html,1695744911,STORY,"['O', 'XOM', 'MDT', 'ESS', 'SWK', 'BF-B', 'HRL']","[The economic outlook is increasingly uncertain. Between inflation, high-interest rates, and an aggressive Federal Reserve, there is plenty that could hamper the market’s returns over the next year. However, there is one area of the market with a steadier outlook: High-quality dividend stocks. In particular, the Dividend Aristocrats are a great place to go hunting for stable firms that can provide generous income through all economic climates.That’s because these companies have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years, proving their trustworthiness on a grand scale. These are the seven best dividend stocks to buy for consistent income and tantalizing share price upside.Dividend Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. It also has chemical and refining assets, which have proven invaluable in recent years. Especially as refining margins have soared and chemical prices turned higher amid the current inflationary wave.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBetter, Exxon has continued to grow in its core oil production business as well. Unlike many firms that have pivoted to renewable energy, Exxon Mobil has remained focused on increasing production from traditional oil fields. That has paid off in spades recently with the price of oil skyrocketing. Exxon’s new offshore field in Guyana, in particular, has proven to be a gusher.Exxon’s massive business produces tremendous cash flows and has delivered steadily increasing dividends for decades now. And the current macroeconomic and geopolitical instability seems likely to support higher commodity prices, and, as such, further gains for XOM stock.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a leading power tools company that has enjoyed a tremendous run-up during the early days of the pandemic. People were stuck at home and decided to invest in tools for home maintenance and renovation projects. As a result, Stanley Black &amp; Decker enjoyed record sales and profits. Since then, however, sales have fallen back to normal. As a result, profits fell even further as the company got stuck with excess inventory. Most people don’t need to buy new power tools every year, and as such, a lot of folks who bought new equipment in 2020 or 2021 will be set for a while.Story continuesHowever, the negativity is dramatically overblown. SWK stock fell from a peak of more than $200/share to just $83 today. Furthermore, shares went for about $160 prior to the onset of COVID-19. All this speaks to a company where sharp near-term negativity has caused its shares to slump beyond any reasonable valuation. With the drop, SWK stock now yields 3.9%.Dividend Stocks: Hormel Foods (HRL)Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockHormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is a packaged foods company focused on proteins. The company was founded more than a century ago and originally focused on commodity meat goods along with its SPAM canned pork product.However, the Hormel of today is a wholly different animal. Now Hormel has best-selling brands within varied fields including organic deli meats, bacon and pepperoni, almonds and nut butter, and ready-to-eat guacamole. Hormel has evolved with the times and now has a leading brand portfolio that is squarely focused on appealing to millennial and Gen Z consumers.Hormel’s profitability has slipped over the past two years. That comes due to supply chain and labor issues which have driven up Hormel’s production costs. However, as livestock and grain prices have slipped and supply chains have started to catch back up, that is relieving much of the problems on the cost side.All this sets up for Hormel to deliver sharply higher profits as its business gets back to regular operations. Meanwhile, thanks to the near-term dip in Hormel’s earnings and stock price, the company is now offering a solid 2.8% starting dividend yield.Essex Property Trust (ESS)EU Modern european complex of apartment buildings. Apartment buildingsSource: Roman Babakin / ShutterstockEssex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) is a leading West Coast multifamily apartment owner. Its portfolio consists of more than 62,000 apartments spread across 252 different communities. Essex believes its apartments are well-situated as they are in cities with high growth, and which are home to attractive high-paying industries such as technology.Most real estate investment trusts (REITs), including Essex, have slumped this year. The industry is dealing with higher interest rates, which cause a firm’s debt to cost more upon refinancing. In addition, investors have demanded higher dividends from stocks to compensate for the rise in interest rates on risk-free bonds and certificates of deposit.This selling has created a buy-the-dip opportunity in ESS stock. As high interest rates make home mortgages more expensive, we will see that serve as a structural driver that boosts demand for apartments. And, in the longer term, rents have a tendency to keep rising at a steady clip, which will grow Essex’s cash flows considerably over time.Dividend Stocks: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is another REIT that has sold off this year. The firm is a triple net lease REIT, which is a type of rental arrangement where the tenants — rather than the landlord — pay for key expenses such as maintenance and utilities.O stock has slumped due to higher interest rates and economic concerns. Much of Realty Income’s business is in renting properties to industrial and retail firms, and folks are understandably cautious about the outlook given the possibility of a recession. However, these worries have pushed Realty Income shares into bargain territory. Now offering a 6% yield, Realty Income is near its lowest valuation in many years. Adding to the attraction for income investors, Realty Income pays its dividend in monthly installments.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a medical device company that is known for its cardiology products. Over the years, however, it has grown and now addresses a wide range of other conditions such as diabetes and neurology.Medtronic has been a massive winner historically. However, after decades of outperformance, MDT stock has hit a pause. Shares are at $80 today; that’s the same price they were at back in 2016. The underperformance is in large part because of the pandemic. There were many delays around elective surgeries at that time. And supply chain and clinical disruptions made it harder to research and bring new products to market. It likely won’t be until at least mid-2024 before Medtronic gets fully back on track operationally.However, the long-term opportunity remains tremendous; analysts believe the global market will reach nearly $1 trillion in revenue by 2030. Medtronic stock is a relative bargain today at 16 times earnings and with a 3.4% dividend yield.Brown-Forman (BF-B)a close up of Jack Daniels WhiskeySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) is a leading alcoholic spirits company. It is primarily known for its Jack Daniels whiskey. That brand was so powerful that the firm survived even the U.S. prohibition without going bust. In more recent years, in addition to growing Jack Daniels into an international franchise, Brown-Forman has also made a heavy push into the booming tequila market.Brown-Forman shares have underperformed recently. Like other consumer staples companies such as Hormel, Brown-Forman faces margin pressure. The cost of product inputs such as agave (for tequila) and bottles and packaging material soared during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the temporary closure of bars and restaurants pressured on-premise demand.As these issues clear up and the industry returns to regular conditions, however, Brown-Forman will see its profitability pick back up. In the long run, spirits companies have tremendous brands, and wonderful profit margins, and operate in an industry with minimal risk of technological disruption. All this makes Brown-Forman a great dividend stock for the long haul that is currently undervalued due to temporary market conditions.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HRL, MDT, BF.A, SWK, and XOM stock.

In the latest one, Britain's media regulator asked the country's antitrust authority to investigate U.S. tech giants Amazon and Microsoft's dominance of the UK cloud market.Here are some of the actions taken by European watchdogs to keep a tab on big technology companies:EUROPEAN UNIONMicrosoft said in August it would unbundle chat and video app Teams from its Office product in a bid to avoid a possible EU antitrust fine, a month after the European Commission launched an investigation into its Office and Teams tie-up.Meta Platforms offered in July to curb the use of competitors' advertising data for its Facebook Marketplace online classified service in an attempt to settle an EU antitrust investigation but regulators rebuffed it, people familiar with the matter said.In May, Meta was hit with a record 1.2-billion euro ($1.27 billion) fine by the EU's lead privacy regulator for its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the United States.EU regulators said in June that Alphabet's Google may have to sell part of its adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices, threatening the company with its harshest regulatory penalty to date.The EU competition watchdog last year accused Apple of restricting rivals' access to its tap-and-go technology, NFC, used for mobile wallets, making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices. The regulators have since continued their investigation.In December 2022, Amazon settled three antitrust probes after it addressed the EU's concerns over its use of sellers' data.In September, the EU picked out 22 so-called ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of its wide-ranging Digital Markets Act (DMA).Story continuesBRITAINBritain's media regulator on Oct. 5 asked the country's antitrust authority CMA to investigate Amazon and Microsoft's dominance of the UK cloud market, citing features that made it more difficult for businesses to switch or mix and match cloud providers. CMA will complete its investigation by April 2025.FRANCEThe French competition authority raided Nvidia's local offices in the last week of September, the Wall Street Journal reported. The watchdog disclosed the raid on Sept. 27, but did not name the company beyond saying it was in the ""graphics cards sector"".Nvidia declined to comment.The antitrust authority in July said Apple may have violated regulations related to the utilisation of iPhone user data in advertising and could potentially misuse its dominant market position by imposing biased, unclear, and unfair conditions to handle user data.The country's privacy watchdog said in July it was aware of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin crypto project and that the legality of its biometric data collection ""seems questionable as do the conditions for storing biometric data"".GERMANYGoogle has agreed to change its user data practices to end a German antitrust investigation aimed at curbing its data-driven market power, the German cartel office said on Oct. 5. Google's commitments will give users more choice on how their data is used across the company's platforms, the regulator said.A German data watchdog has been investigating Worldcoin since late 2022. Worldcoin, which launched in July 2023, requires users to give their iris scans in exchange for a digital ID and, in some countries, free cryptocurrency.ITALYItaly's antitrust agency said in May it had opened a probe into Apple for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the apps market.In April, the watchdog took measures against Meta over an alleged abuse of its position in the country, in a probe involving the rights to music posted on the group's platforms.OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot was temporarily banned in Italy in March over concerns by the national data protection authority, but was made available to users again in April.The antitrust authority said in March it had opened an investigation into TikTok for allegedly breaching its rules by allowing the publication of ""dangerous content"" inciting suicide, self-harm and poor nutrition.NETHERLANDSThe Dutch competition regulator on Oct. 2 said it had rejected Apple's objections against fines of 50 million euros it had given the company over failure to comply with regulations aimed at limiting the dominant position of Apple's App Store. Apple will appeal the decision in Dutch courts.POLANDA Polish watchdog said in September it was investigating OpenAI over a complaint that ChatGPT breaks European Union data protection laws.Poland's competition and consumer protection authority in February accused Amazon's European arm of misleading sales and delivery practices.SPAINSpain's antitrust watchdog in July fined Amazon and Apple for colluding to limit the online sale of devices from Apple and competitors in the country.($1 = 0.9458 euros)(Reporting by Alessandro Parodi, Victor Goury-Laffont, Olivier Cherfan and Paolo Laudani in Gdansk; editing by Milla Nissi and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.McKesson (MCK)San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation is a health care services and information technology company. McKesson operates through two segments:MCK sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite gained less than 0.1%.Concerns about high treasury yields, the possibility of a further rate hike by the Fed in 2023 and the strengthening U.S. dollar influenced trade last week. A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports costlier, impacting international trade. Consumer confidence for the month came in much lower than expected, and investors continued to worry about the direction the Fed would be taking the economy toward with its monetary policy decisions. Currently, an interest rate cut is not expected before September 2024.For the quarter, the S&amp;P 500 dropped about 3.6%, the Dow lost 2.6% and the Nasdaq fell 4.1%.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story continuesThis stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned +10.8% this year (through July 3) versus +16.1% for the S&amp;P 500 Index and +7.7% for the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 Index. The set of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the strong recent performance of mega-cap stocks.We are not trying to cherry-pick here.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Genuine Parts in FocusGenuine Parts (GPC) is headquartered in Atlanta, and is in the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The stock has seen a price change of -16.79% since the start of the year. The auto and industrial parts distributor is paying out a dividend of $0.95 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.63% compared to the Automotive - Replacement Parts industry's yield of 1.11% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.80 is up 6.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Genuine Parts has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.62%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Genuine Parts's payout ratio is 43%, which means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, GPC expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $9.25 per share, with earnings expected to increase 10.91% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that GPC is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $21.33 billion, up 5.83% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Walt Disney. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.7% higher within the past month. Walt Disney currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Walt Disney is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 21.86. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.93.It is also worth noting that DIS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.62. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

(WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.Prior to Monday's meeting, SAG AFTRA and the AMPTP had not held official talks since the strike first began.📢 Rise and shine #SagAftraMembers! As we return to negotiations, remember that our fight isn't over. Join us on the picket lines or at an event near you TODAY and let's keep pushing until we win what we deserve! 🎭💫 #SagAftraStrong pic.twitter.com/e5PBTfEhC2— SAG-AFTRA (@sagaftra) October 2, 2023The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Story continuesIndustry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Wage increases will be a likely sticking point as the union is currently demanding an 11% general wage increase in year one, a 4% increase in year two, and another 4% boost in year three.To compare, the WGA achieved a 5% wage increase this year followed by a 4% jump in 2024 and a 3.5% boost in 2025.SAG-AFTRA member John Schmitt, second from right, and others carry signs on the picket line outside Netflix on Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2023, in Los Angeles. Hollywood's writers strike was declared over Tuesday night when board members from the union approved a contract agreement with studios, bringing the industry at least partly back from a historic halt in production. The actors strike continues in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Chris Pizzello/AP Photo)Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The company said the move will allow it to continue investing in content for the streaming service.“We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers,” the company said.Amazon added that it will not change the price of Prime Membership in 2024.The ads are set to be rolled out in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Canada in early 2024, followed by France, Italy, Spain, Mexico and Australia later in the year. Prime members will be emailed several weeks before ads are introduced with information on how to sign up for the ad-free option, Amazon said.“Since we launched Prime in 2005, we’ve continued to improve the program and add to the list of benefits our members enjoy,” the company said. “You can expect us to continue to add benefits and features over time.”The news follows other streaming services announcing new or updated ad-free pricing. These include Disney, which earlier this year said it would hike ad-free Disney Plus Premium prices to $13.99, up from $10.99, beginning October 12. However, the company said its Disney Plus with ads version will remain at the current price of $7.99 per month.With so many streaming choices, it’s tempting to load up on subscriptions and leave them running, as Kiplinger recently reported. Costs can add up quickly unless you take proactive steps to reduce them such as, for example, canceling the ones that you use the least — you can always re-subscribe when there’s a new show or movie that you want to watch. You can also try pay-per-view to manage a single show, which sometimes can be cheaper than subscribing to a service. Check out Kiplinger's guide to how to save on streaming services which has a number of tips on cutting your streaming costs.RELATED CONTENTHow To Save On Streaming Services and Find Streaming Deals33 Best Amazon Prime Benefits to Use in 202321 Things You Can't Return to Amazon]"

""As we move toward a cleaner energy future, we need to build a tech-savvy workforce. We hope that programs like ComEd STEM Labs will inspire larger numbers of diverse students to pursue a STEM-focused career.""The event, part of ComEd’s STEM Labs program, engaged seventy-five Latino high school students from across Chicagoland and northern Illinois on Saturday, Sept. 30, at ComEd’s Chicago North facility. The students worked with ComEd mentors and special guest, Dr. Kate Biberdorf, a renowned author, chemist and science educator to explore a variety of STEM activities including learning about batteries and building their own Bluetooth speakers. In addition to building Bluetooth speakers and networking with ComEd mentors and executives, each student received a $250 scholarship upon completing the program.Latino Americans make up 17% of the U.S. workforce, but only 8% of STEM workers. Studies show that despite being as interested in STEM as other ethnic groups, Latino students are less likely to take STEM courses in high school, which decreases he likelihood they will pursue opportunities that lead to careers in STEM, according to the Student Research Foundation.Story continuesComEd STEM Labs is one example of how ComEd is preparing more students of color and women to become leaders in the clean-energy transition. Additional STEM and scholarship programs include the ComEd EV Rally, Power of STEM, Future of Energy Scholarships and Drop Me In. These programs all focus on giving diverse groups of students greater exposure to the possibilities of STEM.

Additionally, Comcast acquired Sky in 2018, the dominant television provider in the U.K. and a significant pay-television provider in Italy, Germany, and Austria.Analyzing Comcast Corp's Dividend Performance and SustainabilityComcast Corp's Consistent Dividend HistoryComcast Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2008, distributed on a quarterly basis.

Over the past decade, Comcast Corp's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 12.80%.Story continuesAnalyzing Comcast Corp's Dividend Performance and SustainabilityAssessing Dividend Sustainability: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityComcast Corp's dividend payout ratio as of 2023-06-30 is 0.70, suggesting that the company's dividend may not be sustainable. However, Comcast Corp's profitability rank of 8 out of 10 suggests good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Looking at Growth Metrics for Future ProspectsComcast Corp's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Marathon Petroleum (MPC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 29 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 31, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.58 a share.MPC has an Earnings ESP figure of 5.23%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.20.MPC is part of a big group of Oils-Energy stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Devon Energy (DVN) as well.Devon Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 7, 2023. DVN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.50 a share 36 days from its next earnings release.Devon Energy's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.88% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MPC and DVN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

293,96bc8bba-66fb-3e57-9503-02f376424bc5,ORCL,2023-10-03,‘Don’t Be Fooled by the Bears’: Billionaire Ken Fisher Advises Investors to Stay Put — Here Are 2 Stocks He’s Heavily Invested In,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-fooled-bears-billionaire-141005540.html,1696255805,STORY,"['LRCX', 'ORCL']","[The bulls took hold of the stock market narrative at the start of the year, and charged ahead all the way into mid-summer, but since then the bears have been rather noisy. On the back of rising oil prices, fears of interest rates staying high for longer than hoped for, and the possible prospect of a recession still looming, the markets have been shaky and have been handing back prior gains.However, against a backdrop of a ‘Goldilocks economy,’ i.e., “not too hot, not too cold… just right,” billionaire investor Ken Fisher thinks it’s all just a repeat of a scenario that played out earlier in the year.“Recall how at the start of the year dire bearishness, with expectations of a recession, was in vogue,” says the Fisher Investments founder. “Since spring 2022, bears swore Fed hikes, with a list of other worries – Ukraine and Silicon Valley Bank among them – would kneecap GDP which they believed necessary to slow inflation.”But Fisher notes inflation has meaningfully retreated from June 2022’s high of 9.1% (it is now at 3.67%), while GDP growth has exceeded expectations and claims most of the negativity is “hyperbole – multiple bouts of hand-wringing for every actual market break of short-term, downside volatility.”These pullbacks are just a common feature of “young bull markets,” and the fact Goldilocks showed up is a sign people can “envision a better future.”“Rather than getting too wrapped up in it,” Fisher concludes, “I’d advise you to stay put and keep eating your own porridge.”That is exactly what Fisher is doing. Befitting someone who thinks the bearish noises only offer an unpleasant distraction to the ongoing bull market, Fisher, who has a net worth of ~$7.1 billion, remains heavily invested in certain equities. We ran pair of his picks through the TipRanks database to see what the Street experts make of their chances. Here are the details.Oracle Corporation (ORCL)For our first Fisher-backed stock, we’ll turn our attention to a software giant. Oracle is a globally renowned American multinational tech firm and since being founded in 1977, has evolved into a company boasting a market cap over $290 billion.Story continuesOracle has a rich history in database management systems, and over the years has expanded its portfolio to encompass a wide range of software and cloud-based solutions, including customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management (HCM), and cloud infrastructure services.However, Oracle’s influence extends beyond its software and cloud solutions. The company is known for its hardware products, including servers and storage systems, which complement its software offerings. This combination of hardware and software allows Oracle to provide integrated solutions designed to meet the complex needs of large enterprises and organizations.That said, Oracle might be an industry giant, but it hasn’t all been smooth sailing recently. After strong FQ3 results, the latest quarterly readout was a mixed affair. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (August quarter), revenue climbed by 8.7% year-over-year to $12.45 billion, falling just shy of expectations – by $20 million. And while cloud revenue increased by 29% year-over-year to $4.6 billion, that was well under the 55% y/y growth seen in F4Q23. On the other hand, there was a beat on the bottom-line, as adj. EPS of $1.19 came in ahead of the forecast by $0.04.For Ken Fisher’s part, he remains long and strong here. His current ORCL holdings total 18,537,261 shares, amounting to a market value of $1.98 billion.Oracle also gets the support of HSBC analyst Stephen Bersey, who sees good times ahead for the tech giant.“After many years of its low- to mid-single digit organic top-line growth, we see the potential for Oracle to accelerate turnover growth and to drive earnings growth at a rate above revenue growth as we also see the potential for OPM (Oracle process manufacturing) expansion,” the 5-star analyst said. “Oracle has been building out its global cloud infrastructure, and as these cloud centers are completed, the work of selling and deploying begins. We believe that Oracle is at a turning point given its inventory of globally dispersed cloud centers and that selling momentum could be building, which we reflect in our near-term estimates for turnover growth.”These comments underpin Bersey’s Buy rating on ORCAL, while his $144 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 35%. (To watch Bersey’s track record, click here)A look at the consensus breakdown reveals there is a fairly even amount of Oracle bulls and fence-sitters on Wall Street. The stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 11 Buys and 12 Holds. Going by the $130.47 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for~23% premium. (See Oracle stock forecast)Lam Research (LRCX)For our next Fisher-endorsed stock, we’ll check out another industry giant. Lam Research is a leading global supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services, providing advanced solutions for the fabrication of integrated circuits.The company specializes in the development and production of wafer fabrication equipment, including deposition, etch, and clean process systems, critical in the making of cutting-edge semiconductor devices. Lam Research’s tech and expertise enable semiconductor manufacturers to produce smaller, more powerful, and energy-efficient chips, thereby contributing to the advancement of electronic devices such as smartphones, data servers, and various other consumer and industrial applications.The semiconductor industry is known to be heavily cyclical, and despite figures dropping sharply compared to the same period a year ago, Lam exceeded expectations in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 report (June quarter). Revenue fell by 30.8% from the same period a year ago to $3.21 billion, yet the figure trumped consensus expectations by $60 million. Adj. EPS declined from last year’s $8.83 to $5.98, yet that figure beat the forecast by $0.85. Moving forward, the company anticipates first-quarter revenue will hit the range between $3.1 to $3.7 billion, higher at the mid-point than the Street’s $3.28 billion estimate.Fisher also has a big position here. He currently owns 2,813,207 LAM shares, which command a market value of $1.79 billion.Wolfe analyst Chris Caso is the Street’s most prominent Lam Research bull, and he believes the company’s earnings are set to meaningfully improve once the cycle turns again in its favor.“Lam has the most exposure to memory in our SCE (semiconductor capital equipment) coverage and memory spending has remained suppressed YTD. We believe that’s created a wide gap between Lam’s true earnings power and cyclically depressed CY23 numbers,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We see LRCX getting back to ~$36 in annual EPS by FY25 (about inline with consensus) on only $5.2bn memory spending (vs. $6.8bn peak, $4.6bn FY23). We think that still leaves room for estimates to move higher as memory spending eventually normalizes. We see line of sight to ~$40 EPS in CY25 with LAM trading at just 16.5x that EPS power.”Along with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, Caso’s Street-high $825 price target implies LRCX shares are set for growth of 29% over the coming months. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)Overall, LRCX stock has picked up a Moderate Buy rating from the Wall Street analyst consensus, based on 19 recent analyst reviews which include 13 Buys and 6 Holds. The shares are trading for $637.70 and the $706.82 average price target suggests a one-year upside of ~11%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the cloud computing industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy.Cloud Computing: An Area In Tech Worth Looking IntoThe information technology sector is one that has continued to exceed investor and analyst expectations during 2023. Developments such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI has primarily spearheaded the tech rally, bringing the stock prices for tech stocks higher than ever before. However, AI isn't the only area of tech that deserves investor attention at this moment. Another exciting field of development and investment is cloud computing, as individuals, corporations, and governments worldwide shift to a more digital future.According to tech experts and concerned professionals in the cloud computing space, this area of information technology is only just starting to grow. Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, joined CNBC in June 2022 to discuss this. Here are some of his comments from back then:""We've always said that in the fullness of time, it's possible that AWS could become the largest business at Amazon. Now Amazon has other large and great businesses and so it could take a while for us to get there, but I think that possibility is there. Essentially, IT is going to move to the cloud. It's gonna take a while, you've seen maybe only, call it 10% of IT today move to cloud. So it's still day one, it's still early.""Can Cloud Computing Grow To Greater Heights?Back then, Selipsky was noting that AWS was still in the course of its growth. A Bloomberg article from June 2022 later noted that this business alone was on track to achieve a $3 trillion valuation, which was almost three times its value back then, although it did not mention when this would be achieved. This is just one example of a cloud business that is expected to hit record highs in the near future. As the world is rapidly continuing to move towards the development of digital infrastructure, and as companies are committing themselves to move their information technology operations to the cloud, we can expect to see further growth and expansion in this market.Story continuesConsidering the above, cloud computing stocks such as Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc.

The rapid emergence of AI-assisted software development tools can speed innovation, allowing companies to produce more, richer apps at lower cost. In addition, companies are deploying AI tools as sales and marketing enablers—helping with both prospect targeting and client service. We believe the companies with modern technology infrastructures, proprietary data sets and adaptive cultures are best positioned to take advantage of these tools.We are focused on aligning with forward-thinking management teams who are investing to creatively deploy these capabilities. For example, Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) has the dominant CRM platform for pharmaceutical sales and marketing organizations.

(NYSE:TWLO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and thereby reduced our subsector weight in software. The company reported a decent third quarter, but disappointed on fourth quarter 2022, full year 2023, and long-term guidance. The company is seeing macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown spreading from technology, social media and cryptocurrency to retail and e-commerce. The other negative disclosure and a driver of this gross margin “miss” was that Twilio’s software sales are not accelerating at the rate that we expected. We are disappointed with this lower topline and low operating margin improvement guidance. The business transformation is taking longer than expected, and there is the heightened possibility that the new software growth could be stifled by more formidable competition as Twilio has made too many missteps.”13.

Our view is that subscription growth can meaningfully outperform current estimates through cross-selling to customers that are looking to consolidate vendors, acquiring customers in emerging areas such as mid-sized and international companies, implementing price increases as renewals come due and increasing adoption of its financial management offering among the Fortune 500 customer base.”8.

Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”6.

One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”Like Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), Adobe Inc.

HAS is capitalizing on strong expansion in emerging markets, the success of recent product launches and heightened demand in the gaming sector. The company holds a positive outlook for its growth prospects in the coming three years. Nonetheless, elevated costs continue to be a focal point of concern.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversBeyond advancing its brands and capitalizing on strategic toy lines and licenses, Hasbro aims to expand its global footprint by venturing into emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. These burgeoning markets present substantial opportunities for revenue expansion, outperforming developed markets.Hasbro's investments in advertising and brand-building efforts have notably contributed to its revenue stream. Strong improvement has been witnessed in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Management envisions double-digit growth in emerging markets over the next few years. Emphasizing innovation in products, entertainment and market share gains, Hasbro remains committed to its five-year plan (2018 to 2023-24), particularly in doubling its Wizards business.Maintaining a commitment to innovation, Hasbro has forged a strategic partnership with Paramount to elevate storytelling and content capabilities. Additionally, it has directed investments into Boulder Media, its animation studio, bolstering digital capacities to stimulate sales.The ongoing release of Transformers Franchise across various entertainment mediums, including movies, television and digital platforms, underscores Hasbro's dynamic approach. With a robust and forward-looking plan for Transformers franchise spanning the next decade, Has anticipates substantial revenue growth.Hasbro, which share space with Mattel, Inc. MAT, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. JAKK and Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, is witnessing strong gaming demand. It has a supreme gaming portfolio, and it is refining gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms like face-to-face gaming, tabletop gaming and digital gaming experiences in mobile. Given a strong product lineup and a greater focus on entertainment backed products, Hasbro's Entertainment and Licensing segment is poised for growth.Story continuesHAS is optimistic about its growth opportunities over the next three years. It anticipates operating profit growth of 50% over the same time frame. It also has plans to further increase its operating profit margin to 20% by 2027.Additionally, management noted that its Operational Excellence program will deliver $250-$300 million in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2025. By 2023 end, it expects cost savings of $150 million.ConcernsHasbro's initiatives including product launches and a shift toward more technology-driven toys for reviving its brands and boosting sales are likely to drive profits in the long term. However, costs related to those initiatives might prove detrimental in the near term. It has shouldered high expenses with respect to freight, product costs, sales allowances, and various toy and gaming products closeouts.For fiscal 2023, the company expects revenues to decline 3-6% year over year. Segment wise, it envisions revenues in Consumer Products to decline year over year (at cc) in the mid-single digits. In fiscal 2023, it projects Entertainment revenues to plunge 25-30% year over year. Adjusted operating margin is expected to dip on account of D&amp;D film impairment and industry strikes.A Brief Discussion About Abovementioned StocksMattel is benefiting from product portfolio expansion strategies across its key brands, Optimizing for Growth program and solid demand for Hot Wheels. Also, initiatives to capture the full value of its IPs and transform itself into a high-performing toy company bode well.JAKKS Pacific is gaining from the FOB business model, strategic acquisitions and a solid international footprint. Also, its focus on innovation, and collaborations with popular brands and movie franchisees bode well. The company realizes the importance of online retailing and shifted its focus to boosting online salesActivision’s top line is expected to benefit from an expanding user base of Call of Duty, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush franchises. This is expected to boost in-games spending, thereby driving net bookings and top-line growth in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also, the focus on digital initiatives bodes well. However, inflationary pressures and a volatile macro environment pose concerns.Let’s delve deeper.Growth CatalystsCheesecake Factory continues to benefit from its robust off-premise sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, off-premise contributed 22% to Cheesecake Factory’s total restaurant sales. Also, off-premise average weekly sales doubled compared with fiscal 2019 levels. The company implemented operational changes and technology upgrades to boost consumer convenience, including a contactless menu, payment technology and text paging. We believe a boost in customer count and targeted off-premise marketing will likely drive the channel’s performance further.Cheesecake Factory continues to focus on the development front to drive growth. In fiscal 2023, the company expects to open about 20 new restaurants comprising six Cheesecake Factory restaurants, five North Italia restaurants and nine FRC restaurants (including three Flower Child locations). To this end, the company set aside $160-$170 million in capex to support its restaurant's unit development and maintenance. With a strong pipeline, the company anticipates achieving unit growth of 7% in the upcoming year.Increased focus on Fox Restaurant Concepts (or FRC) bodes well. FRC concept sales have continued to build and off-premise volumes were solid. During the fiscal second quarter of 2023, FRC (excluding Flower Child) recorded sales of $65.7 million, marking a 9.5% increase compared with the prior year's levels. FRC's (including Flower Child) average weekly sales were $142,300, and external bakery sales amounted to $15.4 million.During the fiscal second quarter, FRC opened its brick-and-mortar location of Fly Bye (a fast-casual dining concept) in the Phoenix market and reported impressive sales. Given the solid customer feedback, the company remains optimistic and anticipates opening more Fly Bye locations in the upcoming periods.Story continuesConcernsCheesecake Factory, which shares space with Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG, McDonald's Corporation MCD and Restaurant Brands International Inc. QSR in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry — has been affected by inflationary pressures, supply chain challenges and a challenging macro environment.During the fiscal second quarter, the company reported delays in opening new restaurants due to supply chain challenges and delays in permitting, construction, landlord readiness and equipment availability. This and commodity inflation added to the negatives. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. It anticipates the headwinds to persist for some time.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company anticipates commodity inflation in the low single digits. Labor inflation for the same quarter is expected at mid-single digits. For fiscal 2023, our model predicts the total cost of sales to rise 2% year over year to $826.9 million.A Brief Review of the Other StocksChipotle will likely benefit from digital initiatives, Chipotlane add-ons and culinary improvements. Also, the emphasis on menu innovation bodes well. The company has redesigned and simplified the online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering and collaborated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. There has also been a significant increase in digital orders and guest satisfaction since the rollout of its “Smarter Pickup Times” technology. To drive growth, the company emphasizes testing changes to the more brilliant pickup times logic (based on different sales and deployment levels). The company also focuses on robotics-based autonomous vehicles for delivery, which will likely enhance the customer experience in the upcoming periods.McDonald's benefits from its digital efforts, menu innovation and expansion initiatives. Also, focus on the loyalty program and drive-thru channels bodes well. During the second quarter of 2023, digital dales (from the top six markets) came in at $8 billion, contributing 40% to the company’s system-wide sales. The company's ""MyMcDonald's"" digital experience growth engine is transforming its dine-in, drive-through, takeout, delivery and curbside pickup services. In the United States, 95% of its restaurants offer drive-thru facilities. The company intends to focus on continued digital innovation to boost customer engagement and drive digital acquisition and customer frequency.Restaurant Brands benefits from strong comparable sales growth, expansion initiatives and menu innovation. Also, the focus on digitalization efforts bodes well. During the second quarter of 2023, the company emphasized investments concerning fuel-to-flame advertising and digital investment. This initiative paves the path for improvements in creative messaging and ad testing and installing indoor digital menu boards, point-of-sale systems and printers. It also emphasized investments concerning kitchen equipment upgradation (with toasters and fryers) and property improvements (like parking lot repairs and lighting). The company emphasizes streamlining its products and simplifying its menu boards to boost order accuracy and overall customer satisfaction.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Chimienti said Wendy's also inflated the amount of toppings it uses.In a 19-page decision, Gonzalez said the chains' efforts to made their burgers look appetizing was ""no different than other companies' use of visually appealing images to foster positive associations with their products.""He said McDonald's and Wendy's were not legally obligated to sell burgers by advertising them, and that their websites provided ""prominent, objective information"" about the burgers' weight and caloric content.Gonzalez also said it is not misleading to depict fewer toppings than the plaintiff's ""personally preferred amount.""Lawyers for Chimienti did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. McDonald's, Wendy's and their lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.On Aug. 29, a federal judge in Miami said Burger King, a unit of Restaurant Brands International, must defend against a similar lawsuit over how it depicts Whopper sandwiches on in-store menu boards.

311,84b2f587-e44d-3169-8701-0b3901ec7fcd,PLD,2023-10-03,Big leap forward for fleet electrification: Prologis launches accessible EV charging infrastructure,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-leap-forward-fleet-electrification-193500097.html,1696275300,STORY,['PLD'],"[(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The logistics industry continues to be a strong area of focus for government leaders hoping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the progression of transportation-related climate change. As a result, legislators are driving emission-cutting regulations forward at breakneck speeds.In California, for example, the Advanced Clean Fleet rule requires a large percentage of fleets to stop purchasing trucks with internal combustion engines after 2023. The state’s zero-emissions regulations are particularly stringent when it comes to drayage.“Starting Jan. 1 of next year, only [zero-emissions vehicles] can register in the CARB’s drayage registry. Vehicles with internal combustion engines that are on the road now can continue to operate through their ‘useful life.’ Those limits mean that when a drayage truck hits 800,000 miles, it can no longer be listed in the registry of drayage vehicles,” FreightWaves’ John Kingston reported earlier this year.These state level regulations highlight a nationwide trend: electrification is shaping the future of trucking. Fleets should start preparing for that reality now, regardless of which states they operate in.While electric trucks offer attractive environmental and long-term cost-savings benefits, it can be challenging for trucking companies to start making the transition from a traditional, diesel-dependent fleet to an electric one.Global Head of Prologis Mobility Henrik Holland highlighted a couple of concerns expressed by fleet operators when it comes to EV adoption: Upfront capital investment and the complexity of charging infrastructure.Upfront costs are one of the biggest hurdles stunting electric vehicle adoption. The good news is that high costs tend to be tied to the batteries that power EVs, and the cost associated with producing those parts is on the decline.  Vehicle manufacturers are working hard to keep that trend going in order to drive down initial purchase costs.Story continuesIn fact, the total cost to own an electric vehicle is expected to be 25%  lower than the total cost to own a vehicle with an internal combustion engine by next year, according to global consulting firm McKinsey. This shrinking number can be attributed to the fact that electric vehicles have significantly lower maintenance costs than their conventional counterparts.Even with more accessible pricing, however, purchasing EVs is not financially feasible for every – or even most – fleets. That is where government grant programs and other incentives can come into play.The United States Environmental Protection Agency is also stepping up to make electric truck adoption more affordable.“The Inflation Reduction Act invests $1 billion to replace dirty heavy-duty vehicles with clean, zero-emission vehicles, support zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and to train and develop workers,” according to the EPA website.That funding will be distributed between spring 2024 and 2031.Making it possible for fleets to purchase electric trucks is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to facilitating a full scale EV transition. Even if they can afford to purchase vehicles, most fleets do not have the resources to build and maintain charging infrastructure in all the locations their trucks need to recharge.The lack of available charging infrastructure is a major EV deterrent. Prologis is working to change that.“For fleet operators, there is a tremendous amount of complexity – a new type of vehicle, a new type of fuel,” Holland said. “We believe it is important to make things really simple.”In order to make the transition to EVs as simple as possible, Prologis offers fleets the ability to charge their trucks at both Prologis and non-Prologis warehouses and at hubs across the country without paying upfront fees. Much like filling up on diesel, fleets only pay for the energy they use when charging their trucks.For example, the company installed two major charging stations in Southern California – Santa Fe Springs and the City of Commerce – late last year.‘Two large installations are up and running, energizing a total of 38 new electric trucks that are reducing noise and emissions on Southern California roadways,” Prologis noted in a press release about the installations. “The projects provide more than four megawatts of total installed charging capacity.”Prologis is in the process of developing dedicated charging hubs not tied to specific warehouses. These stations will be located in strategic locations – such as near busy ports – to provide additional flexibility for customers. Hubs also allow customers without the space for chargers onsite – or those with plans to move in the near future – with the ability to charge fleets and transition to EVs faster.“If you think about what is important when it comes to EV charging, it is about location,” Holland said.Prologis is dedicated to creating the partnerships necessary to bring vehicles, infrastructure and energy into harmony and continue to make EV charging more accessible across the nation.“We realize it takes a community to make this happen,” Holland said.Prologis is a leading global industrial real estate company. This expertise is precisely what sets the company apart as a top-notch EV transition and charging partner.The post Big leap forward for fleet electrification: Prologis launches accessible EV charging infrastructure appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Prologis in FocusHeadquartered in San Francisco, Prologis (PLD) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -0.46% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.87 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.1%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 4.97%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.71%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.48 is up 10.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Prologis has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 13.43%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Prologis's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PLD expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.33%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PLD is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nearly two-thirds (63%) of workers report plans to ask for a raise before the end of the year, mainly driven by concerns related to:Higher inflation (39%)Taking on more responsibilities (26%)Feeling underpaid after checking salary market rates (16%)Almost one-third (31%) of workers said they will look for a new job if they don't get a raise.2.  Flexible work holds weight. More than 6 in 10 workers (62%) would rather stay in a job with flexible work options than accept a higher paying position with rigid in-office requirements. This is most common among Gen Zers (74%) and working parents (68%).3.  Negotiation pitfalls are common. Nearly half (47%) of workers admit to making a salary negotiation mistake, the most common being:Accepting too low of a salary for their skills and experience (61%)Placing too much emphasis on pay versus the full package, inclusive of perks and benefits (30%)Failing to research current salary ranges (29%)Story continues4.  Salary transparency offers a hiring advantage. About 6 in 10 hiring managers said that including salary information in job postings helps attract qualified candidates (63%) and provides an edge against competitors (60%). Workers also want pay transparency, and 57% said they would take themselves out of consideration for a role if salary ranges aren't provided upon request.5.  Companies are poised to pay up for top talent. The hiring market is still primarily candidate driven, with more job openings than available talent. As a result, more than half of employers (51%) plan to increase starting salaries in 2024 to attract highly skilled workers. Another 46% said they are adding new perks and benefits.""Competitive pay and flexible work are top of mind for professionals and will likely influence their career decisions in 2024,"" said Dawn Fay, operational president of Robert Half. ""To attract and retain top talent — particularly in an uncertain economy — it's critical for employers to benchmark salaries and compensation packages, consider options for hybrid work, and employ strategies to bolster employee engagement and morale.""While salaries are expected to increase in 2024, they will likely be more measured than in recent years.

This includes over $600 million raised in equity commitments from T. Rowe Price and a group of global institutional investors with long-term investment orientations, in addition to $875 million in credit facility commitments. OCREDIT will build on this momentum by opening this perpetual offering to individual investors.""From the beginning of our partnership with OHA, we have shared a vision to build a broader business in private markets by combining their expertise in private credit with T. Rowe Price's global scale,"" said Rob Sharps, chief executive officer and president of T. Rowe Price. ""OCREDIT offers just that, bringing the benefits of private credit – historically available only to institutional investors – to individual investors and their advisors.""OCREDIT seeks to generate attractive returns driven by generally strong and stable current income through different market environments, including periods of market volatility. The fund invests in a diversified portfolio of primarily senior secured, privately originated loans to larger, well-established, recession-resistant companies located predominately in North America. OCREDIT harnesses the differentiated capabilities of OHA's $61 billion credit specialist platform developed and proven over its 30-year history.""Consistent with OHA's history, OCREDIT focuses on market-leading companies that we believe offer better credit profiles with experienced management teams, diverse sources of revenue and the potential to weather challenging market conditions,"" said Eric Muller, portfolio manager and partner at OHA and OCREDIT chief executive officer.

Consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. For a free prospectus containing this and other information, call 1-855-405-6488 or visit www.troweprice.com. Read it carefully.A BDC is a special closed-end investment vehicle that is regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""1940 Act"") and used to facilitate capital formation by smaller U.S. companies. BDCs are subject to certain restrictions applicable to investment companies under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, at least 70% of our assets must be the type of ""qualifying"" assets listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, as described herein, which are generally privately-offered securities issued by U.S. private companies or U.S. publicly-traded companies with market capitalizations less than $250 million.OCREDIT is a non-exchange traded business development company (""BDC"") that expects to invest at least 80% of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments (loans and other credit investments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private companies). This investment involves a high degree of risk. An investor should purchase these securities only if they can afford the complete loss of the investment.Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulator has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Securities regulators have also not passed upon whether this offering can be sold in compliance with existing or future suitability or Regulation Best Interest standard to any or all purchasers.As of October 2, 2023, OCREDIT is available in 48 states and territories, excluding Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington. No offers or sales of OCREDIT securities may be made to residents of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington. As of October 2, 2023, OCREDIT is not registered for offer or sale outside of the United States.BDCs may charge management fees, incentive fees, as well as other fees associated with servicing loans. These fees will detract from the total return.OCREDIT may in certain circumstances invest companies experiencing distress, increasing the risk of default or failure. OCREDIT is not listed on an exchange, which heightens liquidity risk. OCREDIT has limited prior operating history, and there is no assurance that it will achieve its investment objectives. This is a ""blind pool"" offering and thus investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.  Investors should not expect to be able to sell shares regardless of performance and should consider that they may not have access to the money invested for an extended period of time and may be unable to reduce their exposure in a market downturn.OCREDIT employs leverage, which increases the volatility of OCREDIT's investments and will magnify the potential for loss. Fixed income securities are subject to credit risk, call risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield bonds involve greater risk. International investments can be riskier than U.S. investments and subject to foreign exchange risk.OCREDIT is ""non-diversified,"" meaning it may invest a greater portion of its assets in a single company. OCREDIT's share price can be expected to fluctuate more than that of a comparable diversified fund.  OCREDIT may invest in derivatives, which may be riskier or more volatile than other types of investments because they are generally more sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions.Account opening and closing fees may apply depending on the amount invested and the timing of the account closure. There may be costs associated with the investments in the account such as periodic management fees, incentive fees, loads, other expenses or brokerage commissions. Fees for optional services may also apply.Opinions and estimates offered herein constitute the judgment of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. as of the date this document is provided to an investor and are subject to change, as are statements about market trends.

318,5feb7d92-204e-3a5b-b233-513db158f8c6,TROW,2023-10-03,3 Stocks to Sell Ahead of the Coming VIX Spike,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-sell-ahead-coming-221324438.html,1695766404,STORY,"['EXPD', 'TROW']","[Uncertainty is something that we can evaluate in the financial markets in general. There are many tools and indicators that we can monitor to visualize and quantify uncertainty at a general level in the markets, but there is something that is completely individual and that is risk aversion. It is true that we cannot visualize the future to know what will happen in the financial markets. However, in a possible VIX spike, there are stocks to sell that are more vulnerable than others.I bring you three stocks to sell that you should ditch in a scenario like that. Let’s briefly analyze each of them, remember to make your own decision based on your analysis and risk aversion.Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD)Cargo ship transporting goods. Maritime logistics. Logistics.Source: Travel mania / ShutterstockExpeditors International of Washington (NASDAQ:EXPD) is a company primarily engaged in international freight forwarding and logistics. Its primary function is to facilitate the efficient movement of products and cargo for its customers worldwide. This includes the management of air, sea and land shipments. It also includes the coordination of customs and related formalities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe reason it is considered one of our stocks to sell ahead of a possible increase in the volatility index (VIX) is due to its recent financial performance. According to their financial results for the second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, they have experienced a marked decline in several key metrics.Diluted earnings attributable to shareholders per share (EPS) decreased 43% to $1.30 per share.Earnings attributable to shareholders decreased by 48% to $197 million. Operating income decreased by 51% to $248 million. Total revenue decreased by 51% to $2.2 billion.In addition, there was a significant decrease in airfreight tonnage volume and ocean container volume, with declines of 15% and 13%, respectively. This decline in cargo volumes suggests weaker demand for EXPD’s logistics services, which could indicate difficulties in its industry.Story continuesIn relation to the VIX, an increase in market volatility could negatively affect EXPD and other stocks, as economic uncertainty often reduces investor confidence and can lead to massive stock sell-offs. Given the deterioration in their financial performance and the decline in demand for their services, they may be particularly vulnerable to any increase in market volatility.Allison Transmission (ALSN)A close-up photograph of a car engine representing SINT Stock.Source: OlegRi / Shutterstock.comAllison Transmission Holdings (NYSE:ALSN) is a company that manufactures automatic transmissions for commercial and military vehicles. Simply put, they make the part that allows vehicles to shift gears automatically, which is essential in heavy-duty applications.Now, some experts believe that this is a stock that is very sensitive to rises in the VIX.However, Allison Transmission “appears” to be in a strong position based on the financial results provided. In the second quarter of 2023, they reported record quarterly net sales of $783 million, an 18% increase throughout the same period last year. In addition, they achieved net income of $175 million, representing 22% of net sales, a substantial 43% increase throughout the prior year. Diluted earnings per share also showed impressive growth of 52% compared to the same period last year, reaching $1.92.The company’s CEO, David S. Graziosi, highlighted the company’s strong performance, especially in terms of sales growth and improved gross margin. In addition, they are committed to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. They even raised their 2023 full-year net sales guidance to $3 billion, suggesting confidence in their future performance.Still, if you hold this stock in your portfolio, it is worth considering evaluating the rationale behind your decision to own it, but in the face of a possible rise in the VIX, it is advisable to be cautious.Rowe Price Group (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comRowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) is a firm dedicated to helping individuals and institutions manage their investments and plan for retirement.Their goal is for individuals to effectively achieve their financial goals. Lately, however, the question has arisen as to whether it is wise to sell its stock ahead of a possible increase in the volatility index (VIX), which indicates uncertainty in the markets.The latest news reveals a positive performance for them. They have beaten expectations by reporting second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.02, beating estimates of $1.73.In addition, they have identified cost savings that could slow expense growth going forward, and their net income increased 6.4% in the second quarter to $1.61 billion, up from $1.51 billion a year earlier. This seems to indicate good near-term performance.However, it is important to remember that short-term performance does not guarantee long-term stability, especially for a company whose performance is tied to market swings, such as T. Rowe Price. The concern is that if the VIX rises, which usually indicates market turbulence, it could negatively affect the company’s stock.As of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Now, those same companies are fighting to fill trucks as demand shrinks.Excluding the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and Amazon.com, UPS and FedEx dominate the U.S. doorstep delivery sector with a share of almost 50% and combined annual revenue of $191 billion. They have pushed through annual general rate increases of more than 30% from 2019 to 2024, and are often nearly lock step on pricing. ""They have to fight for every package right now, it's great for shippers,"" said LJM Consultants partner Kenneth Moyer, a former UPS pricing negotiator who now works with delivery customers.That's because soft demand created an environment that is ""very juicy"" with opportunities for customers to squeeze out savings, said Deyman Doolittle, co-founder of data-driven consulting firm ShipSigma, which helps them cut shipping costs.The consultants declined to identify their clients.Rates for ground delivery services favored by online retailers dipped below 2022 levels during the second quarter and are forecast to be down for the entire third quarter, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Ground Parcel Freight Index. If that full-quarter drop materializes, it would be the first since the index started collecting year-over-year data in January 2019.FedEx in a statement said it strategically manages rates with customers based on factors, including volume level, business segment and shipment type.Story continuesUPS in a statement said it is not using discounts as the sole way to win back business lost during its contentious Teamster contract talks this summer. The world's biggest parcel delivery firm added it is using price negotiations to encourage attractive high-margin or high-volume customers, while discouraging high-cost deliveries.The new carrier stance has helped some online retailers reduce costs, which can then in turn lower prices for shoppers.Department store Macy's and designer fashion leasing company Rent the Runway - both UPS customers - told Wall Street they were reaping savings thanks to recently negotiated delivery deals, including a 50 basis point reduction in the second quarter at Macy's. Both declined to comment for this story.The swing in power dynamics has been unusually swift, said Moyer, who said his firm recently won savings worth $6.8 million for a UPS customer. Earlier this year that same customer saw a request for a $500,000 discount dismissed, Moyer added, without specifying the client.While deals vary widely between customers, shippers generally are reaping savings of around 8%-12% from their previous agreements, said Mark Taylor, senior director of transportation consulting at Korber Supply Chain. Those discounts are similar to what companies saw pre-pandemic.While those savings are far from offsetting years of price hikes, a return to past discount levels ""feels like a windfall,"" said Taylor, a former FedEx Ground project manager.THREE-DECADE MISMATCHA yawning supply-demand mismatch is threatening to exacerbate carrier profit pressures.UPS, FedEx, USPS and Amazon combined have capacity to deliver more than 110 million parcels per day while their customers are only sending about 70 million daily packages for delivery - the biggest imbalance in at least three decades, said Satish Jindel, president of delivery consultancy ShipMatrix.Third quarter ground delivery rates are forecast to fall 0.55% per package versus a the year earlier period, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Ground Pacrel Freight Index.While such a move may not be significant for small companies, it can result in meaningful savings for large customers, said Micheal McDonagh, president of parcel services at AFS Logistics.Discounts also are increasing for air-based express package delivery rates, which are expected to decline 1.5% from the second quarter but rise 1.9% from a year ago, he added.The demand downturn hit FedEx earlier and harder than at UPS, pricing advisers said, prompting it to begin discounting sooner and more aggressively than UPS.But UPS was also shoring up business ahead of the July 31 expiration of its contract with about 340,000 workers represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.UPS added to the pressure with its fight to win back the 1.2 million packages per day that customers redirected to FedEx, USPS and regional rivals this summer ahead of a threatened Teamsters strike, pricing consultants said.FedEx has said it can keep the roughly 400,000 packages per day it added during the UPS talks without lowering prices.But experts are skeptical, particularly as UPS offers to cover early termination fees for customers that switched to FedEx.""Due to UPS's aggressiveness, FedEx is not shy about doing what it takes to win business either,"" Jey Yokeley, vice president of sales for negotiating advisory firm TransImpact.(This story has been corrected to change comparison for discounts to 'previous agreements' instead of 'list prices' in paragraph 13)(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Ben Klayman and Aurora Ellis)]"

That is nearly double the 9.9% compound annual gain of the S&amp;P 500.The impressive returns also amount to an overall total return of 3,787,464% dwarfing the 24,708% gain for the S&amp;P 500. Thus, it is not surprising that investors stuck with Buffett's investment strategies have generated millions of dollars. The high returns explain why investors are always watching Berkshire Hathaway to get a glimpse of the direction the market is likely to move and ideal investment opportunities.Buffett has made a name for himself as a value-oriented investor who takes out positions in companies he feels are highly undervalued and misunderstood. The value investing strategy focuses on the intrinsic value of a particular stock rather than technical indicators. In this case, he focuses on understanding the company’s financials, focusing on earnings and income statements, underlying fundamentals, and long-term prospects.He is best known as a buy-and-hold investor not interested in buying and selling stocks in the near term for quick profits. Instead, he settles on stocks he feels offer solid long-term prospects for moderate but reliable growth. In the second quarter, Buffett's portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway was worth $348 billion, an increase from $325 billion in the first quarter.Story continuesThe Berkshire Hathaway manager has been ramping up his position in his favorite stock, Apple, which now accounts for 40% of the holding company's 13F equity portfolio. Buffett has always been bullish on Apple owing to its lucrative buyback program that has made the investment firm over $100 billion since 2016. Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and American Express are some of his other top picks.Recently, Buffett has been one of the most aggressive hedge fund managers, taking advantage of the high-interest rate environment. Backed by a mountain of cash, $147 billion at the end of June, the legendary investor has been pursuing investments that can generate substantial returns with short-term rates topping 5%.The legendary investor has already started betting on the housing market amid the rising mortgage rates, having bought more than $700 million worth of homebuilder DR Horton stock. He has also taken out stakes in fellow builders Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR).15 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale NowWhile the focus has always been Buffett's stellar market performance, it’s becoming increasingly clear that gurus are not immune to mistakes or bad investments.

V provided an update to its dispute program for first-party fraud or friendly fraud, for card-not-present transactions. The move is expected to help merchants fight first-party misuse, saving small businesses more than billions in losses worldwide in the next half a decade. The improvement is expected to benefit the consumer-merchant ecosystem.In current market conditions, small businesses are fighting hard for their margins. As such, the rule change is expected to provide them some impetus, helping them keep their rightfully earned money. With rising digital transactions over the past few years, fraud activities have dramatically surged. First-party misuse is just one universe in the multiverse of fraud activities.The move highlights Visa’s focus on minimizing the impact of fraud and protecting consumers and merchants. The company’s investments in ensuring the security of payment solutions are enabling it to advance its digital platform. This has been spotlighted by the company in multiple instances over the past few months as the regulators and legislators have been talking about increasing competition in the payment space (Credit Card Competition Act bill).Visa and Mastercard Incorporated MA are right at the center of this debate. The primary argument against increasing competition has been that it can affect the level of security. The supply of better and more effective security technologies and related R&amp;D comes with expensive price tags, which will likely be difficult for smaller rivals to cough up right from the beginning.There are other competitors in the payments space providing digital banking products and credit payment services, including American Express Company AXP and Discover Financial Services DFS, with comparatively lower market share. These companies provide their respective unique financial products to capture market share.American Express offers lines of credit to small businesses and invests in technological improvements to bring in more customers and boost volumes. Discover Financial uses in-house resources and third-party vendors to pursue technology advancements.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NetApp The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.26bUS$1.36bUS$1.43bUS$1.48bUS$1.53bUS$1.57bUS$1.61bUS$1.65bUS$1.69bUS$1.73bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.40%Est @ 2.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$963US$912US$862US$813US$767(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.2%) = US$28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$75.9, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NetApp as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.266. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NetAppStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For NetApp, we've put together three additional items you should explore:Risks: You should be aware of the 2 warning signs for NetApp (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does NTAP's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 4/10GF Value rank: 6/10Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned NiSource Inc the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding NiSource Inc BusinessNiSource Inc is one of the nation's largest natural gas distribution companies, serving approximately 3.2 million customers across Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The company's electric utility transmits and distributes electricity in northern Indiana to about 500,000 customers. The regulated electric utility also owns more than 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity, most of which is now coal-fired but is being replaced by natural gas and renewable energy. With a market cap of $9.84 billion and sales of $5.85 billion, the company has an operating margin of 20.9%.Story continuesUnraveling NiSource Inc (NI): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownNiSource Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.97 positions it worse than 61.63% of 430 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.52, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 5.97, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 71.07% of 439 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where NiSource Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -1.6 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 86.49% of 481 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, NiSource Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling NiSource Inc (NI): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights NiSource Inc's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a rich history in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its current financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to maintain its historical performance. As value investors, it's crucial to consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

One such stock that merits attention is PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL). The stock, which is currently priced at 22.75, recorded a loss of 3.44% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 12.63%. The stock's fair valuation is $44.16, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PPL. Click here to check it out. PPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PPLThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Risk FactorsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.89, and a Beneish M-Score of -1.73 that exceeds -1.78, the threshold for potential earnings manipulation. the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is PPL a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL), despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-Score and Beneish M-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Developed by Professor Messod Beneish, the Beneish M-Score is based on eight financial variables that reflect different aspects of a company's financial performance and position. These are Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Gross Margin (GM), Total Long-term Assets Less Property, Plant and Equipment over Total Assets (TATA), change in Revenue (?REV), change in Depreciation and Amortization (?DA), change in Selling, General and Admin expenses (?SGA), change in Debt-to-Asset Ratio (?LVG), and Net Income Less Non-Operating Income and Cash Flow from Operations over Total Assets (?NOATA).Company OverviewPPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) is a holding company of regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Rhode Island. The Pennsylvania regulated delivery and transmission segment distributes electricity to customers in central and eastern Pennsylvania. LG&amp;E and KU are involved in regulated electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in Kentucky. The Kentucky utilities also serve gas customers. Narragansett operates electric and gas utilities in Rhode Island.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapPPL's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of PPL's Altman Z-score reveals PPL's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Gross Margin index tracks the evolution of a company's gross profit as a proportion of its revenue. A downward trend could indicate issues such as overproduction or more generous credit terms, both of which are potential red flags for earnings manipulation. By examining the past three years of PPL's historical data (2021: 49.49; 2022: 42.90; 2023: 36.11), we find that its Gross Margin has contracted by 5.97%. Such a contraction in the gross margin can negatively impact the company's profitability as it signifies lesser income from each dollar of sales. This could put a strain on the company's capacity to manage operating costs, potentially undermining its financial stability.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Change in SG&amp;A ExpensesThe change in Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses provides insight into a company's operational costs, encompassing expenses related to selling products and managing the business. Examining PPL's SG&amp;A data over the past three years (2021: 0; 2022: 0; 2023: 0), an unexpected decrease may raise eyebrows. While reducing these expenses can be a sign of improved efficiency, an abrupt or unexplained decrease might indicate cost-cutting measures taken to artificially inflate earnings. By selectively reducing SG&amp;A expenses, a company can create the illusion of higher profitability and operational efficiency. However, if these reductions are achieved by neglecting essential functions like marketing, customer service, or quality control, it might result in long-term negative effects on the company's growth, reputation, and sustainability. Hence, a decrease in SG&amp;A must be carefully evaluated within the broader context of the company's strategy, industry norms, and competitive landscape to determine if it signals potential earnings manipulation or a legitimate improvement in operational efficiency.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of PPL, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 10.61; 2020: 5.88; 2021: 7.22; 2022: 8.66; 2023: 11.74; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-3.5%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for PPL's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is PPL (PPL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-1.3%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (11%) does not show a promising uptick. These indicators could suggest the company is struggling to translate sales into profits effectively, a critical element of a successful business model.ConclusionDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, PPL's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In PPL's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .To find out the high quality companies that may deliever above average returns, please check out GuruFocus High Quality Low Capex Screener.Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International Is Mondelez International Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.35bUS$4.84bUS$5.23bUS$5.64bUS$5.96bUS$6.23bUS$6.46bUS$6.68bUS$6.88bUS$7.07bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.57%Est @ 4.54%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.1kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$42bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$180bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$180b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$99bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$142b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$69.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mondelez InternationalStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Food industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The Joint Study Agreement for the DAC facility, signed at the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi, is the first project announced since the companies signed a memorandum of understanding on August 1, 2023, to jointly explore carbon capture, utilization and storage projects in the United States and the UAE.The study will assess the feasibility of building the first megaton-scale DAC facility outside the United States, using the same carbon dioxide (CO2) extraction technology to be deployed in the plant 1PointFive is constructing in Ector County, Texas. The Texas facility, named Stratos, is designed to include DAC technology developed by Canada-based Carbon Engineering and is expected to capture up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year when fully operational.1PointFive is marketing carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits to assist hard-to-abate industries and other companies achieve their net-zero targets. 1PointFive announced a 10-year, 250,000 tonne-CDR credit agreement with Amazon in September and a three-year, 30,000 tonne-CDR credit agreement with All Nippon Airways in August. Both agreements call for sequestering DAC-captured CO2 in saline reservoirs not used for oil and gas production.If the UAE project is approved, CO2 extracted at the DAC facility is expected to be connected to ADNOC’s CO2 infrastructure in Abu Dhabi for injection and permanent storage into saline reservoirs not used for oil and gas production. ADNOC is in the testing phase of the world’s first fully sequestered CO2 injection well in a carbonate saline aquifer in Abu Dhabi.Story continues“This agreement demonstrates how Oxy and ADNOC are committed to advancing direct air capture technology in the UAE and underscores the necessary urgency needed to deliver global-scale climate solutions,” said Vicki Hollub, Occidental President and CEO. “We will continue leveraging our carbon management expertise to deliver value, engage committed partners and accelerate our ability to achieve our net-zero targets and help others meet theirs.”Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Executive Director for Low Carbon Solutions and International Growth at ADNOC said: “Today’s announcement represents continued positive momentum in our partnership with Occidental to significantly scale up promising carbon management technologies. This joint investment in the proposed first megaton direct air capture facility in the region exemplifies ADNOC’s commitment to leverage partnerships and promising technology to accelerate our decarbonization journey on the way to net zero by 2045.”In addition to the preliminary engineering study for a megaton-scale DAC in the UAE, the terms of the memorandum of understanding include:ADNOC may evaluate participation in DAC facilities and CO2 sequestration hubs under development in the United States by 1PointFive;Occidental and ADNOC may also evaluate jointly developing one or more UAE-located CO2 sequestration hubs; andThe companies will also consider opportunities to incorporate innovative CO2-based technologies into the UAE, including technologies in which Occidental has made investments, such as emissions-free power and sustainable fuels.The MOU was enabled by the UAE-U.S. Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and is expected to mobilize $100 billion in clean energy and carbon management projects, including CCS and DAC by 2035.About Occidental Occidental is an international energy company with assets primarily in the United States, the Middle East and North Africa.

We may get compensation if you visit partner links on our site. We may not cover every available offer. Our relationship with advertisers may impact how an offer is presented on our website. However, our selection of products is made independently of our relationship to advertisers.The intro offer on the Capital One Venture X Business card is a jaw-dropping 150,000 bonus miles, worth between $1,500 and $2,775 when redeemed for travel. That’s one of the most generous available of any rewards credit card. The catch? You must spend at least $30,000 on the card in the first three months of card ownership.That $30,000 spend requirement is so steep, we debated whether or not to profile this card. But because the miles value is compelling we opted to include it with a few caveats.You should only apply for this card if you can answer ""yes"" to at least one of these questions. And remember, you cannot charge personal expenses to a business card.Does your business typically spend at least $10,000 a month on expenses that could be paid with a card?Have you planned some major capital expenditure in the next three months, like a new corporate vehicle, computers or heavy equipment?Were you planning to splurge on upgrades to your business that you can afford, like new office furniture?If you answered ""no"" to the questions above, of you just don't like that spend requirement, there are plenty of other good options. For example, the Chase line of Ink Business cards recently launched $900 welcome offers with lower spend requirements.Venture X Business Card OverviewSign-up bonus: Earn 150,000 bonus points after you spend $30,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. According to The Points Guy, Capital One miles are worth 1.85 cents each, making the bonus offer worth up to $2,775 when redeemed for travel at a partner airline. The rate for a cash redemption is only a half penny for each mile, rendering the bonus worth only $750 in cash back.Interest rate: Since this is a charge card that must be paid in full every month, there is no interest rate. Any unpaid portion of your bill will be charged a 2.99% late payment fee.Annual fee: $395. This fee is about average for a premium card, but may be mostly offset by the $300 annual credit on Capital One Travel.Foreign transaction fee: None, so this card is ideal for travel abroad.Top rewards rate: Ten miles back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Other rewards rate: Five miles back on flights booked through Capital One Travel. Two miles back on all other purchases.Annual rewards: Every year, you'll get 10,000 bonus miles after your account anniversary date. Plus, receive an annual $300 credit for bookings through Capital One Travel.Business-friendly benefits: Free employee cards, with the ability to set individual spending limits on them. Authorized users do not get airport lounge access.Travel lounges and benefits: As a premium travel rewards card, this Capital One card comes chock full of travel perks. Access 1,200+ participating VIP lounges, in more than 148 countries. Get unlimited free lounge visits for you and 2 guests. Lounges include fresh local food options, high-speed WiFi and relaxation rooms. Receive up to a $100 statement credit on Global Entry or TSA PreCheck®Redemption: Miles earned are worth a penny each if you redeem them for travel on the Capital One portal, or you may transfer them to participating partners, potentially delivering more value for your miles. The cash back rate is only half a cent.Story continuesWhat Can You Spend the Bonus Miles On?You may use the 150,000 bonus miles in several ways.Book travel through Capital One’s portal ($1,500 value): redeem miles on the company’s travel portal on a 1:1 basis. This is the simplest way to get the full value of your bonus miles.Transfer miles to a partner frequent flyer or hotel program ($1,500 variable value up to $2,775): Capital One partners with fourteen airlines and two hotel chains at a one-penny-per-point ratio, so you can easily transfer your Capital One miles to your preferred partner program. Since the points on these partner programs may vary in value depending on how and when you use them, the actual value of your transferred Capital One miles may be more or less than 1:1. Before you transfer miles, make sure the travel you want to book is available.  Two other transfer partners redeem less than on a 1:1 ratio. Taiwanese carrier EVA Air redeems at a 2:1.5 ratio, so you could redeem 10,000 Capital One miles for only $75 worth of EVA points. The French hotel chain Accor only offers a 2:1 ratio, meaning you only get fifty cents to the dollar on points transferred.Redeem miles for expenses on a past trip ($1,500 value): Book your travel through your preferred travel website or travel agent using your Capital One Rewards card. Then, within 90 days from the date your travel purchase posts to your account, sign in to your account at capitalone.com and select Cover Your Travel Purchases. It may take a couple of months for the credit to post to your account.Shop at Amazon.com ($1,200 value): You may redeem purchases at Amazon for 0.8 cents for each mile. Although this is slightly better than opting for cash back, it is still well below the redemption rate of many cash back credit cards.Cash Back ($750 value): You should avoid redeeming your bonus for cash back, as it delivers the lowest value of any redemption type. By logging into your Capital One reward account, you will see options for cash back at the rate of one-half penny for each mile. You may redeem any amount for a check in the mail or an account credit.Capital One Transfer PartnersThe Capital One Venture rewards program has partnerships with 15 airlines, allowing cardholders to transfer Capital One Venture miles to the partner rewards programs. These partners cover destinations across much of the globe, including off-the-beaten-path destinations like Istanbul, Turkey and Barbados.Capital One Venture rewards miles are worth one point on most of these carriers when you log in to your Capital One account, transfer Capital One miles to the frequent flyer account of a partner, and book your travel on the partner's website. These Capital One transfer partners are as follows:When you transfer 1,000 Capital One miles to any of these transfer partners, you’ll receive 1,000 miles or points with the following travel loyalty programs:Aeromexico Club Premier (based in Mexico)Air Canada - Aeroplan®Cathay Pacific - Asia Miles (based in Hong Kong)Avianca LifeMiles (based in Colombia)British Airways Executive ClubEmirates Skywards (based in Dubai)Etihad Guest (based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates)Finnair Plus (based in Finland)Flying Blue (for Air France and for KLM, based in the Netherlands)Qantas Frequent Flyer (Australia)Singapore Airlines KrisFlyerTAP Miles&amp;Go (based in Portugal)Turkish Airlines Miles&amp;SmilesVirgin Red (based in the U.K. but partnered with Delta Airlines)EVA Air - Infinity MileageLands (based in Taiwan). This program carries a 2:1.5 transfer ratio, so 1,000 Capital One miles are only worth 750 miles when using this loyalty program.The Capital One Ventures rewards program also partners with three hotel chains. Capital One miles are worth one point at each of these hotels, but are worth half as much if booked with Accor hotels chain.Choice Privileges®Wyndham RewardsALL - Accor Live Limitless, with a 2:1 transfer ratio. When you transfer 1,000 Capital One miles to this transfer partner, you’ll receive 500 miles or points with its travel loyalty program.Pros and cons of the Capital One Venture Rewards cardPros:Generous bonus offer.Unlimited points that do not expire.No foreign transaction fee.Many perks designed for travelers, including price match, price alert, two free lounge visits per year, up to $100 reimbursement for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck pass, and more.Cons:Annual fee of $395 (though partially offset by $300 annual travel credit).Lack of flexibility when redeeming points.Most travel partners are based abroad.Low redemption value for cash back.What to Consider Before Getting a Business CardBefore you apply for a business credit card, here are some potential things to keep in mind to determine whether it's the right move:Your credit score: Most of the top business credit cards require good or excellent credit, which means a FICO credit score of 670 or higher. If your score is lower than that, your options may be limited.Potential costs: Business credit cards often charge high interest rates, and some also assess an annual fee. You can avoid interest by paying your balance in full each month, but if you think you'll be carrying a balance, consider how potential interest charges could impact your bottom line. If you're thinking about getting a card with an annual fee, make sure you can get enough value from the rewards program and perks to make up for it.Whether you can take on another financial account: Managing multiple financial accounts can be challenging. If you already have multiple personal and business accounts to keep track of, adding another one could make things more complicated. In some cases, it can make sense to stick with what you already have, as long as you have enough accounts to keep personal and business expenses separate.Your reasons for wanting one: Business credit cards can help with everyday cash flow, but if you're looking to finance growth in your business beyond the initial stages, you may want to consider a small business loan instead. Also, don't think that using a business credit card will shield you from responsibility if your company goes under — business card issuers typically require a personal guarantee when you apply, so you'll still be personally liable for the debt.Security: Make sure you can keep the account secure, particularly from potential business partners and employees.Other Credit Card Deals and PerksChase Ink Business Cards Launch $900+ OfferEarn $900+ with IHG One Rewards Premier Business Card BonusBest Travel Rewards Credit CardsChase Sapphire Preferred Launches Bonus OfferCredit Cards That Cover Rental Car Insurance]"

(NASDAQ:ULTA) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.10bUS$1.21bUS$1.22bUS$1.32bUS$1.40bUS$1.46bUS$1.51bUS$1.56bUS$1.60bUS$1.64bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.18%Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.15%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.0kUS$1.1kUS$995US$1kUS$990US$963US$930US$895US$859US$823(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.5bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.2%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$17bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$26b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$399, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ulta Beauty as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.004. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Ulta BeautyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Currently debt free.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

RVTY recently unveiled its innovative Pin-point base editing platform reagents. This is expected to provide researchers with greater access to implement the advanced gene editing technique in their preclinical laboratories.The initial reagents launch includes mRNAs for nCas9 and rat APOBEC and three guide RNAs designed to knockout the TRAC, CD52 and PDCD1 loci. Revvity is also offering the flexibility of ordering custom guides for other targets through its Dharmacon custom gRNA ordering tool for the Pin-point base editing platform, thereby supporting various research applications.The latest launch is expected to significantly boost Revvity’s Life Sciences business on a global scale and solidify its foothold in the niche space.Significance of the LaunchBase editing reagents, till now, were either custom-ordered by end-users or obtained by non-profit laboratories as individual components. However, with the newly launched reagents, scientists will now be able to fully assess the Pin-point base editing platform in-house.Base editing signifies a crucial advancement in CRISPR gene editing, thus providing the capability for complex and safe multi-gene editing. This can result in improved functional genomics insights for optimizing drug development and streamlining cell line and cell therapy development and manufacturing. The Pin-point platform is currently one of the few established base editing technologies being employed in clinical settings, thereby positioning it as a discovery and therapeutic tool.Per management, the streamlined approach is expected to simplify complex multi-gene editing. This has the potential for the development of new cell therapies targeting rare inherited genetic diseases and cancer and the creation of universal donor cells as the foundation of allogeneic cell therapies.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Coherent Market Insights, the global cell and gene therapy market was valued at $22.7 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 28.7% between 2023 and 2030. Factors like the increasing demand for innovative treatments and the developing interest in cell and gene treatments for cancer treatments are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch will likely provide a significant impetus to Revvity in the cell and gene therapy space worldwide.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Revvity launched three next-generation technologies, which aim to help scientists drive breakthrough discoveries in biological research. These technologies include the IVIS Spectrum 2 and IVIS SpectrumCT 2 imaging systems, the Quantum GX3 microCT imaging solution and the Vega preclinical ultrasound system.Last month, Revvity announced its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered solid non-COVID organic growth. The revenues from its Life Sciences segment were also robust during the quarter, both on a reported and organic basis.Comparison With PeersA notable name in the cell and gene therapy space is Avantor, Inc. AVTR. In July, AVTR announced its plans to relocate and significantly expand its Innovation Center in Bridgewater, NJ. The expanded Innovation Center, expected to open in August 2024, will be at a nearby location in Bridgewater, NJ.The same month, Avantor reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it recorded strong core organic revenue growth in bioproduction. On the earnings call, management confirmed that Avantor’s focus on cell and gene therapy has been yielding double-digit growth in several critical product lines targeting these workflows. The company also introduced novel volume sampling systems to support Cell &amp; Gene Therapy workflows, Cryogenic Storage Vials to support long-term storage of critical biological samples and a new robotics tip line, the J.T.Baker HT2. These look promising for the stock.Another notable name in the niche space is Catalent, Inc. CTLT, which is also Revvity’s peer. In August, CTLT reported its preliminary fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein management confirmed Catalent’s continued progress in improving its operational performance and winning new business with new and existing customers.In June, Catalent announced that it had expanded its integrated development, manufacturing and supply solution, OneBio Suite, across a range of biologic modalities. This included antibody and recombinant proteins, cell and gene therapies and mRNA.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated VRTX, another peer of Revvity, is also a renowned name in the cell and gene therapy space. This month, VRTX announced that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion for the label extension of KAFTRIO (ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor) in a combination regimen with ivacaftor, for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged two to five years old, who have at least one F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene.Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it recorded a robust uptick in product revenues. This was primarily driven by the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and the continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the United States, including the launch in children with CF aged two to five years old.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale Now.Warren Buffett stands out as the most successful investor after nearly six decades of making waves in the investment world. Even though he turned 93 this year, he is still at the top of his game with sharp mental acuity that is the envy of most investors. Together with his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, they are not showing any signs of slowing down as they remain focused on generating respectable returns for their investors.With a net worth of over $110 billion, Buffett is one of the highest-paid hedge fund managers owing to the solid returns his investment affirms Berkshire Hathaway has always generated. The legendary investor boasts an impressive track record with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway, having delivered a compound annual gain of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. That is nearly double the 9.9% compound annual gain of the S&amp;P 500.The impressive returns also amount to an overall total return of 3,787,464% dwarfing the 24,708% gain for the S&amp;P 500. Thus, it is not surprising that investors stuck with Buffett's investment strategies have generated millions of dollars. The high returns explain why investors are always watching Berkshire Hathaway to get a glimpse of the direction the market is likely to move and ideal investment opportunities.Buffett has made a name for himself as a value-oriented investor who takes out positions in companies he feels are highly undervalued and misunderstood. The value investing strategy focuses on the intrinsic value of a particular stock rather than technical indicators. In this case, he focuses on understanding the company’s financials, focusing on earnings and income statements, underlying fundamentals, and long-term prospects.He is best known as a buy-and-hold investor not interested in buying and selling stocks in the near term for quick profits. Instead, he settles on stocks he feels offer solid long-term prospects for moderate but reliable growth. In the second quarter, Buffett's portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway was worth $348 billion, an increase from $325 billion in the first quarter.Story continuesThe Berkshire Hathaway manager has been ramping up his position in his favorite stock, Apple, which now accounts for 40% of the holding company's 13F equity portfolio. Buffett has always been bullish on Apple owing to its lucrative buyback program that has made the investment firm over $100 billion since 2016. Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and American Express are some of his other top picks.Recently, Buffett has been one of the most aggressive hedge fund managers, taking advantage of the high-interest rate environment. Backed by a mountain of cash, $147 billion at the end of June, the legendary investor has been pursuing investments that can generate substantial returns with short-term rates topping 5%.The legendary investor has already started betting on the housing market amid the rising mortgage rates, having bought more than $700 million worth of homebuilder DR Horton stock. He has also taken out stakes in fellow builders Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR).15 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale NowWhile the focus has always been Buffett's stellar market performance, it’s becoming increasingly clear that gurus are not immune to mistakes or bad investments.

FND is maintaining its growth momentum by focusing on elevating customer services, investing in new and existing stores, and managing profitability efficiently. These factors are supporting the company despite an uncertain economy of rising mortgage rates and low existing home supply.Abiding by one of its growth strategies, Floor &amp; Decor has recently announced the opening of two new warehouse store and design center locations. One of the locations is in Pennsylvania, where the company will open its fourth store in Springfield Township on Oct 5, 2023.

Both the warehouse stores will start its operations with about 50 full-time and part-time associates led by the respective store’s Chief Executive Merchant.The company is optimistic about the two new store launches as it believes this aligns with its growth strategy. It can offer diversified product and service offerings to its new customers while growing in the process, despite the ongoing economic challenges.Expansion Initiatives Driving GrowthFloor &amp; Decor makes strategic investments to process its expansion strategies by improvements in existing stores, opening new stores and accretive buyouts. By expanding its footprint and product portfolio, the company can reach out to new communities and accelerate its growth momentum.Year to date, the company opened 12 new warehouse stores with a total second quarter-end count of 203 warehouse stores and five design studios. It has plans of opening about 32 warehouse format stores in fiscal 2023.

However, these wood companies are gaining from expansion efforts, good repair and remodeling activities and high demand for new homes.Story continuesA Brief Review of the Above-Mentioned StocksWeyerhaeuser: The company is benefiting from solid log demand and a stable repair and remodel market. The company is well-poised due to higher capital inflows for carbon/ESG-related projects, solid housing demand, a focus on operational excellence and a consistent dividend payout. WY remains bullish for the long term as most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including solid home equity levels and an aging housing stock.Boise Cascade: The upward trend of the company is attributable to its vertically-integrated business model, enabling the Wood Products and Building Materials Distribution segments to benefit through a committed distributor and manufacturer partnership. The strategic acquisitions are also aiding the company in solidifying its distribution facilities and production portfolio. Also, rewarding shareholders through special dividends and maintaining a stable liquidity bode well for the company.Trex: Its consistent product portfolio development and strategic sale initiatives help it to maintain growth momentum, despite various macroeconomic and inflationary risks. It gains from improved manufacturing performance and other cost-containment actions. Also, the company’s sound relationships with its top-notch channel partners in the industry assisted it to achieve industry-leading margins and profitability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even though he turned 93 this year, he is still at the top of his game with sharp mental acuity that is the envy of most investors. Together with his long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, they are not showing any signs of slowing down as they remain focused on generating respectable returns for their investors.With a net worth of over $110 billion, Buffett is one of the highest-paid hedge fund managers owing to the solid returns his investment affirms Berkshire Hathaway has always generated. The legendary investor boasts an impressive track record with his holding company Berkshire Hathaway, having delivered a compound annual gain of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. That is nearly double the 9.9% compound annual gain of the S&amp;P 500.The impressive returns also amount to an overall total return of 3,787,464% dwarfing the 24,708% gain for the S&amp;P 500. Thus, it is not surprising that investors stuck with Buffett's investment strategies have generated millions of dollars. The high returns explain why investors are always watching Berkshire Hathaway to get a glimpse of the direction the market is likely to move and ideal investment opportunities.Buffett has made a name for himself as a value-oriented investor who takes out positions in companies he feels are highly undervalued and misunderstood. The value investing strategy focuses on the intrinsic value of a particular stock rather than technical indicators. In this case, he focuses on understanding the company’s financials, focusing on earnings and income statements, underlying fundamentals, and long-term prospects.He is best known as a buy-and-hold investor not interested in buying and selling stocks in the near term for quick profits. Instead, he settles on stocks he feels offer solid long-term prospects for moderate but reliable growth. In the second quarter, Buffett's portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway was worth $348 billion, an increase from $325 billion in the first quarter.Story continuesThe Berkshire Hathaway manager has been ramping up his position in his favorite stock, Apple, which now accounts for 40% of the holding company's 13F equity portfolio. Buffett has always been bullish on Apple owing to its lucrative buyback program that has made the investment firm over $100 billion since 2016. Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and American Express are some of his other top picks.Recently, Buffett has been one of the most aggressive hedge fund managers, taking advantage of the high-interest rate environment. Backed by a mountain of cash, $147 billion at the end of June, the legendary investor has been pursuing investments that can generate substantial returns with short-term rates topping 5%.The legendary investor has already started betting on the housing market amid the rising mortgage rates, having bought more than $700 million worth of homebuilder DR Horton stock. He has also taken out stakes in fellow builders Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR).15 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are On Sale NowWhile the focus has always been Buffett's stellar market performance, it’s becoming increasingly clear that gurus are not immune to mistakes or bad investments.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$28.0bUS$30.6bUS$33.8bUS$33.5bUS$33.5bUS$33.8bUS$34.2bUS$34.7bUS$35.2bUS$35.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 0.10%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.15%Est @ 1.45%Est @ 1.66%Est @ 1.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$26.4kUS$27.1kUS$28.3kUS$26.4kUS$24.9kUS$23.6kUS$22.5kUS$21.5kUS$20.6kUS$19.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$241bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$36b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$916bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$916b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$504bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$746b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$515, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 22.35. But the question remains: is the stock fairly valued? This article delves into a detailed valuation analysis of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) to answer this question. We encourage you to read on for an in-depth look at the company's value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. UNH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UNHUnitedHealth Group is one of the largest private health insurers in the world, providing medical benefits to about 53 million members globally, including 5 million outside the U.S. as of mid-2023. As a leader in employer-sponsored, self-directed, and government-backed insurance plans, UnitedHealth has obtained massive scale in managed care. Along with its insurance assets, UnitedHealth's continued investments in its Optum franchises have created a healthcare services colossus that spans everything from medical and pharmaceutical benefits to providing outpatient care and analytics to both affiliated and third-party customers.Comparing the stock price and the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, provides an insightful perspective on the company's value. This approach efficiently paves the way for a more profound exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.UnitedHealth Group (UNH): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.Story continuesWe believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.The stock of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is believed to be fairly valued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. At its current price of $514.57 per share, UnitedHealth Group has a market cap of $476.60 billion and the stock is believed to be fairly valued.Because UnitedHealth Group is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.UnitedHealth Group (UNH): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares.

Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. UnitedHealth Group has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $348.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $22.35. Its operating margin is 8.75%, which ranks better than 73.33% of 15 companies in the Healthcare Plans industry. Overall, the profitability of UnitedHealth Group is ranked 10 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of UnitedHealth Group is 10.8%, which ranks worse than 66.67% of 18 companies in the Healthcare Plans industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.1%, which ranks better than 76.47% of 17 companies in the Healthcare Plans industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, UnitedHealth Group's return on invested capital is 10.9, and its cost of capital is 8.UnitedHealth Group (UNH): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionOverall, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stock is believed to be fairly valued.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +5.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.83 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.88 indicates a change of +12.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $91.43 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $368.16 billion and $391.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.6% and +6.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.7%. EPS of $6.14 for the same period compares with $5.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +3.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.The Federal Reserve’s September meeting and Jerome Powell’s tone afterwards has dampened hopes of a soft landing. The central bank’s battle against inflation is far from over and there are many other challenges that are coming to hit the economy in the coming months. According to a report by Fortune, Jesse Wheeler, senior economist at the decision intelligence firm MorningConsult, recently warned that the market could face several challenges as the analyst sees “storm clouds out there forming.”One of these storms could be the threat of government shutdown (yet again). Some other challenges highlighted by analysts include rising oil prices and the UAW strike that is hitting major automakers in the US. The Fortune report cited Wells Fargo senior economist Mike Pugliese, who said that the impact of a possible government shutdown would be severe.“While there is never a good time for the federal government to shut down, the potential for one in the current economic environment is more concerning. Not only would a shutdown reduce economic growth modestly, but it would create a data vacuum at a time when the path ahead for the economy is highly uncertain,” Pugliese said.But markets are almost always facing some sort of storms. For beginner investors, it all boils down to finding solid companies and waiting it out.MethodologyFor this article, we first listed all the holding of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) and then gauged hedge fund sentiment for all these stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. We then picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We skipped companies that are cyclical, are about to acquired or are going through a lot of volatility and uncertainties. Analysts and experts recommend beginner investors to have exposure to broader market ETFs to have a safety cushion and almost guaranteed gains (albeit small) over longer periods of time. That’s why we decided to use the holdings data of the SPY ETF.Story continuesBest Stocks for BeginnersPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashBest Beginner Stocks To Buy Now15. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 15th in our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has strong growth catalysts on the back of its AI offerings. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) earlier this year introduced an AI product suite and is also integrating several generative AI features in its existing products.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in the company. The biggest stakeholder of Adobe during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $658 million stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”14. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 111UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the safest stocks out there. The healthcare services company is operating in an industry that is resilient and does not feel drastic effects of broader market downturns.

Another detractor from relative performance was UnitedHealth Group, which was down 8.65%. However, we have a positive long-term view of the company, headquartered in Minnesota, and especially its potential when it comes to harnessing its vast amounts of patient data via AI. Additionally, its Optum unit, which provides technology and data-driven care delivery, has AI-enabled tools that can help healthcare providers drive more efficient and accurate care to patients.”13. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy for long-term growth. Analysts believe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will launch several new products to grab the lucrative generative AI market in the coming weeks and months. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) would be the biggest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chips market.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 112 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AMD. The most significant stakeholder of the company was Philippe Laffont’s  Coatue Management which owns a $1.6 billion stake in the company.L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the June 2023 quarter the AI bubble continued to inflate. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as a key challenger to Nvidia, will benefit from increased demand for its next generation semiconductor chips. AMD’s share price is reflecting very bullish sentiment and the share price has run ahead of a reasonable base case valuation. Accordingly, we divested our entire position and moved AMD to our Bench.”12. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is a strong dividend-paying bank stock with stability and strong fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) shares have gained about 38% over the past 12 months. Thanks to its size and dominance, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) usually does not feel any effects of banking sector jitters since depositors flock to major banks like JPMorgan when small banks falter.11. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks to buy for beginners. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) earlier this year launched several new features for its CRM platform. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) recently held its Dreamforce conference and investment firm Baird praised the event. Baird analyst Rob Oliver said he came out of the event feeling positive about the company’s AI offerings. The analyst has a $220 price target and a Neutral rating on the stock.Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff in Q2 earnings call talked about Salesforce’s generative AI initiatives in detail and said:“We’re democratizing generative AI, making it very easy for our customers to implement every job, every business in every industry. And I will just say that in the last few months, we’ve injected a new layer of generative AI assistance across all of the Customer 360. And you can see it with our salespeople who are now using our Sales Cloud GPT, which has been incredible, what we’ve released this quarter to all of our customers and here inside Salesforce. And then when we see that, they all say to themselves, you know what, in this new world, everyone can now be in Einstein. But democratizing generative AI at scale for the biggest brands in the world requires more than — that’s just these large language models and deep learning algorithms, and we all know that because a lot of our customers kind of think and they have tried and they go and they pull something off a Hugging Face, it is an amazing company.We just invested in their new round and grab a model and put some data in it and nothing happens. And then they don’t understand and they call us and say, hey, what’s happening here? I thought that this AI was so amazing and it’s like, well, it takes a lot to actually get this intelligence to occur. And that’s what I think that’s the value that Salesforce is bringing is that we’re really able to help our customers achieve this kind of technological superiority right out of the box just using our products in a low code, no code way. It’s really just democratization of generative AI at scale. And that is really what we’re trying to achieve that at the heart of every one of these AI transformations becomes our intelligent, integrated and incredible Salesforce platform, and we’re going to show all of that at Dreamforce.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”10.

To skip our detailed analysis of the automotive industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Automotive Stocks To Buy Now.The UAW StrikeThe biggest development in the automotive industry today is the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike. The union has been targeting three automakers primarily, namely General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), after its contract with these companies expired on September 14. It has put forth several demands before the companies, including a 40% wage hike with a 20% immediate increase, according to a Reuters article from September 22. While the contract negotiations continue, the strikes also carry on, a development that might continue to strain the automotive industry.Some believe that the strikes could lead to a further escalation in car prices that are already too high for most consumers. Car prices have been on a steady rise since as far back as 2016. According to a CNBC chart from May 2023, while the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the US was about $33,200 in May 2016, this value had risen to a staggering $47,900 by May 2023. According to a CNBC report from September 22, experts now believe that consumers hoping to purchase a new car can expect to see lower discounts and fewer incentives down the road in light of the UAW strikes.Some hypothesize that one reason why automakers are running into trouble with the UAW is that they are focusing on cost reductions to help move towards an electric-vehicle-focused future, with less reliance being placed on traditional gasoline-powered cars. These cost reductions are thought to include job cuts, which is putting major automakers in heated disagreements with auto workers. While a dedication to electric vehicles is certainly in the interests of protecting the environment and combatting climate change, such a ramification is something that cannot be ignored, especially not by the union workers most affected by it.Story continuesWhat Should Investors Be Looking At?While this is the situation on the ground at present from a consumer point of view, for investors in particular, a major trend to keep an eye on in the automotive industry is, of course, the rise of electric vehicles and the companies producing them. Investors might benefit from keeping an eye on the moves and performance of an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Solactive Pure US Electric Vehicle ETF. The ETF is focusing solely on the top electric vehicle producers and may be an interesting fund to watch for those looking to invest in this space. Sylvia Jablonski, the Chief Investment Officer at Defiance ETF, had the following to say about this ETF on CNBC on September 23:""We realized that investors are buying a lot of ETFs for electric vehicle exposure, but if you break down what is in those ETFs, because of the diversification role, they hold stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. Absolutely great stocks, but they're not electric vehicle stocks. And we thought to ourselves, well, it's better to be diversified than not, right, so instead of just buying Tesla, you want a little more exposure to this space. So we took the top five electric vehicle companies listed in the US by market cap.""As Jablonski explained, this ETF can thus be an attractive investment for those only looking to invest in the electric vehicle space while also diversifying. In general, many automotive industry stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) have proven to be good investment options historically as well. For those looking for more options in the automotive sector at large, we have thus compiled a list of some of the best automotive stocks to buy now for the long term. These include some of the top electric car stocks to buy as well.12 Best Automotive Stocks To Buy NowOur MethodologyTo compile our list below, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter to pick stocks in the automotive industry. We selected a mixture of automotive manufacturers and automotive parts distributors. The stocks are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.Best Automotive Stocks To Buy Now12. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is an automobile manufacturer based in the Netherlands. The company designs, engineers, manufactures, and sells automobiles and light commercial vehicles, engines, transmission systems, and more.As of July 32, Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, maintains a Buy rating on shares of Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA). The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $22.90 to $25.30.We saw 27 hedge funds holding stakes in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) at the end of the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $468.2 million.Miller Value Partners made the following comments about Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated a starter position in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is an automotive stock many hedge funds are piling into today.11. Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 30 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $848.9 million.Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) designs, engineers, produces, and sells luxury performance sports cars across the globe. The company is based in Italy.

The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $368 to $375.Holding 357,181 shares in the company, Marshall Wace LLP was the largest shareholder in Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) at the end of the second quarter.This is what Ensemble Capital Management had to say about Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) (+26.48%): The luxury automaker’s long awaited Purosangue, their first four door, four seater vehicle, has proven so popular that the company announced that they have ceased accepting new orders as they are sold out through all of this year and into 2024. The Purosangue is designed not as copycat sports utility vehicle that many other luxury automakers sell, but as a true Ferrari car that their devoted fan base can use for more practical transportation needs. Since the average Ferrari is only driven a few thousand miles a year or less, they are best understood as mechanical works of art rather than a means of transportation. But with the introduction of the Purosangue, Ferrari enthusiasts will have a vehicle that meets transportation needs, while still delivering the extremely high end experience that you would expect from a car that costs about $500,000.”10. LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Baird analyst Craig Kennison reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) on August 28.

Chang’s, Hop Social Grill, and Cooper’s Hawk Winery &amp; Restaurant.About SCHEELSHISTORY: Three acres of potatoes were the seed for the first SCHEELS store in 1902. Frederick A. Scheel, a German immigrant, used the $300 he earned from that first harvest as the down payment on the first SCHEELS, a small hardware and general merchandise store in Sabin, Minnesota. Over the years, SCHEELS opened in surrounding communities including Fargo in 1930, where the Corporate Offices are located. Firmly planted in the hardware business, SCHEELS had a small selection of sporting goods from the beginning in 1902. Customer interest grew, and more sports lines were added with athletic shoes and clothing being introduced in the product mix in 1972. SCHEELS is now a 32-store operation with stores in 14 states including Colorado, North Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Nevada, Illinois, Utah, Kansas, Texas and Arizona. Currently, Steve D. Scheel, the great grandson of the SCHEELS founder, is the company's Chairman of the Board, and great-great grandson Steve M. Scheel is CEO. Todd Anderson serves as President and oversees SCHEELS daily operations of more than 10,000 associates.About MacerichMacerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT).

The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target TGT, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.Eric Bunyan, the senior vice president of Leasing, East Region, for Macerich, emphasized the significance of these developments. He stated, “The tremendous success of the new Target at Kings Plaza, combined with strong performance for Primark, Zara and Burlington, each of which have been open since 2018 in the former Sears location, demonstrates the power and promise of Kings Plaza, Macerich’s well-located, fully enclosed retail center in Brooklyn.”Bunyan's enthusiasm is well-founded as these national brands selecting Kings Plaza underscore its appeal to diverse demographics, including affluent shoppers from the dynamic trade area.Macerich's approach to leasing, which focuses on creating properties that cater to a broader range of consumer needs, has proven effective. The addition of popular brands like Shake Shack and Ashley Furniture further enhances the shopping experience. Moreover, Macerich is exploring opportunities for a 50,000-square-foot location at the prime corner of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Recent improvements, such as brightening and lightening the attached parking deck, along with upgrades to lighting, furnishings and flooring on the center's second level, have further solidified Kings Plaza as one of the most successful shopping centers in the market.Kings Plaza, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and dining destination with a 10-level parking garage, has an impressive lineup of tenants, including Target, Primark, Zara, Burlington, Lowe's, Ashley Furniture, Sephora and many others. This diverse mix of retailers caters to a wide range of consumer preferences, making Kings Plaza a go-to destination for shopping and dining.Nevertheless, dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

376,2983f372-9dc4-3053-86a8-d7fd737cc3c1,DHI,2023-10-03,Ticking Time Bombs: 3 Homebuilder Stocks to Dump Before the Damage Is Done,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ticking-time-bombs-3-homebuilder-100259246.html,1695808979,STORY,"['DHI', 'MAS', 'TOL']","[The housing market is in a tricky spot right now. Higher interest rates are causing problems and distortions in the market. With the average interest rate charged on a home mortgage in the U.S. now above 7%, existing home sales have all but collapsed. However, new home construction is booming right now, having risen more than 20% in June of this year from the same month in 2022.  This is because existing homeowners are reluctant to sell and give up the locked-in interest rate on their house that is much lower than current rates. That sounds like good news for homebuilder stocks right?But will the boom in new home construction last? There are growing concerns that interest rates staying higher for longer will push the U.S. economy into a recession, dragging both the residential and commercial real estate markets down with it. Here are some homebuilder stocks that are ticking time bombs. Its time to dump them from your portfolio before the damage is done.Toll Brothers (TOL)Toll Brothers Home construction company logo seen displayed on smart phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThere’s a couple of reasons to proceed with caution regarding Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). First of all, the company both builds and arranges the financing of residential and commercial properties in the U.S. It’s wide exposure across the entire home building and construction process makes it especially vulnerable should the market head south. If history has taught us anything it’s that financing and mortgage lenders tend to take it on the chin when the housing market goes into recession or crashes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe second area of concern should be the fact that TOL stock has been on a monster run over the last year. In the past 12 months, Toll Brothers’ share price has increased 80%, driven largely by accelerating demand for the new properties it sees through from initial design to the construction and financing. The red hot rally should make investors weary of getting in at the top only to see the share price plunge should the bottom fall out of the residential and commercial real estate markets.Story continuesMasco Corp. (MAS)A photo of a black faucet and sink next to a window.Source: Elena Podrezenko / Shutterstock.comIn business since 1929, Masco Corp. (NYSE:MAS) manufacturers popular products used in new home construction throughout the U.S. These products include faucets, showerheads, cabinet hardware and toilets, among other items. As one might expect, right now is boom times at Masco and the company’s stock has gained 14% in the last 12 months. Over five years, the share price is up 43%. But, the company is vulnerable to boom-bust cycles.Masco has certainly been here before. The company’s share price collapsed and was trading in penny stock territory in 2009 after the last U.S. housing bubble burst and we entered the Great Recession. While the company and its stock have clawed their way back over the last decade, they could be negatively impacted if interest rates push the housing sector and broader economy into a recession in 2024. The company also has massive overhead with more than 25,000 employees and 90 manufacturing facilities worldwide.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett might have taken a position in D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), but does that mean you should? DHI is highly exposed should demand for new home construction falter. And since it was disclosed that Buffett has taken a shine to homebuilders, DHI stock has declined 6%. The company’s share price is still up nearly 60% over the last 12 months, but signs are emerging that the stock is cooling off after a hot streak.It’s also notable that Buffett’s stake in DHI stock is comparatively small, comprising just 0.2% of his portfolio and worth a total of $645 million. Anything under $1 billion is a pretty small investment for the Oracle of Omaha. With home construction activity in 29 states, D.R. Horton will no doubt be seriously impacted should the housing market swoon. The company also just named Paul Romanowski as its new president and CEO. It is risky undertaking a leadership transition at the highest levels during a sensitive time for the economy and markets. This is among homebuilder stocks where it is wise to proceed with caution.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

This enables the identification and analysis of regions making the most progress and those facing the greatest challenges.""Despite the uncertain economic conditions of the past year, it’s encouraging to see that global financial inclusion continues to improve,"" said Dan Houston, chairman, president, and CEO of Principal. ""We’re optimistic about the ongoing progress governments, financial systems, and employers are making across the globe to help more people gain access to the support they need to feel more financially secure.""Key findingsFinancial inclusion has improved globally. The overall global financial inclusion score displayed a notable increase of 5.6 points, reaching 47.3 out of 100. This is driven by advancements in Southeast Asia and Latin America, bolstered by meaningful progress in the support offered by financial systems.Story continuesSingapore remains the most financially inclusive market. Singapore ranked first, second, and third in the government, employer, and financial system support, respectively. Particularly noteworthy is Singapore’s progress in the employer support pillar, where it rose 12 places.Financial inclusion is advancing most rapidly in markets developing technology-enabled financial systems. The biggest risers include several emerging economies, such as Brazil, Thailand, Vietnam, and South Korea.Progress in financial inclusion is strongly and positively correlated to progress in other metrics of social and economic development, such as lower levels of corruption and greater economic freedom, resilience, and productivity.The world’s largest economies are generally stagnating or deteriorating in terms of financial inclusion. These markets have medium scores in the government and financial system support pillars combined with universally low scores for employer support.""The data shows financial inclusion, at a global level, is improving,"" said Kay Neufeld, director and head of forecasting, Cebr. ""Greater financial inclusion is occurring despite economies navigating through a period of supply-side shocks, heightened inflation, and the consequent adjustments in interest rates. It’s clear that fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets are making the largest strides forward. Meanwhile, developed economies making slower progress in financial inclusion should be seen in the context of these markets already ranking higher on the financial inclusion scale, as indicated in the wider Index findings, and consequently having more limited scope to make as rapid gains.""U.S. findingsFinancial inclusion in the U.S. has fallen slightly, with the country moving from second to fourth in the Index. The drop in rankings was driven by declines in employer (dropping from second to 12th) and government support (dropping from 15th to 19th). The country saw drops in the rankings across all indicators in the employer pillar, with the largest declines realized in employer-provided financial guidance and support (falling 20 places to 26th) and flexible pay initiatives (falling 17 places to 21st).Employer support declined across businesses of all sizes but support from the smallest employers most notably fell. As seen in the 2022 report, there’s a clear link between business size and level of employer support. Larger companies are likely able to offer more comprehensive financial resources and services to their workforce. This may suggest that in the face of economic challenges and ongoing concerns about a potential recession, smaller companies are strategically trimming back areas they believe will have limited impact on ongoing operations.""Employers play a critical role in the financial stability of communities, especially small businesses, which are the backbone of their employees’ financial well-being,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of Benefits and Protection at Principal. ""While the gap in support raises some concerns, it may signal a rebalancing of the labor market, which experienced an unprecedented reshuffle following the pandemic. It’s important to note these behaviors are likely to vary across industries. The businesses we work with have shown incredible resilience through recent economic events and recognize the critical role benefits play for their employees. While the Index provides an opportunity to review the pillars independently, it’s important to consider the three pillars and how they holistically lead to financial inclusion. For example, the passage of SECURE 2.0 signals how all three support pillars can work in tandem to bolster financial inclusion.""The U.S. maintained its top ranking in financial system support. It's ranked in the top three and four of the eight indicators that comprise this pillar, including: ‘access to credit,’ ‘borrowers’ and lenders’ protection rights,’ ‘presence and quality of fintechs,’ and ‘access to capital.’Overall, the U.S. consumer sentiment data reveals an increase in the number of people who report feeling financially excluded. This is particularly pronounced in the government pillar. The percentage of people who feel the government acts in a way that helps them feel financially included declined from 72% in 2022 to 50% in 2023 (dropping from 12th to 27th in the rankings). In contrast, employers retained the top spot in making U.S. consumers feel financially included.Global Financial Inclusion IndexTop 10 MarketsBottom 10 Markets1Singapore33Chile2Hong Kong34Saudi Arabia3Switzerland35Mexico4United States36South Africa5Sweden37Italy6Denmark38Peru7United Kingdom39Colombia8Norway40Nigeria9Australia41Ghana10Thailand42ArgentinaLearn more about the Global Financial Inclusion Index here.Learn more about the methodology here.About the Global Financial Inclusion IndexThe Global Financial Inclusion Index ranks 42 markets on three pillars of financial inclusion—government, financial system, and employer support—using data points across public and survey-based sources.

Kicking off in October in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this effort aims to foster improved health and wellness practices within the U.S. Hispanic community by promoting the importance of proactive health care habits.Joining forces with Aflac for the Remission with a Mission campaign holds a personal significance for me. I discovered the importance of wellness checkups firsthand when I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the young age of 33. My journey has shown me the critical role that early detection and proactive health care play in saving lives.Aflac's ""Remission with a Mission"" campaign confronts a stark reality — 1 in 4 adults have chosen to forgo essential health screenings due to a perception of good health, according to Aflac's Wellness Matters survey, conducted specifically among Hispanics. The survey also unveiled that 72% of Hispanic respondents diagnosed with cancer became aware of their condition during routine medical exams or regularly scheduled annual screenings, compared to 46% among the general population. Additionally, an alarming 31% of Hispanics reported they encounter language barriers that hinder their access to preventive care resources. These findings highlight the urgent need to bridge language gaps and amplify health education initiatives within the U.S. Hispanic community.""Joining forces with Aflac for the 'Remission with a Mission' campaign holds a personal significance for me. I discovered the importance of wellness checkups firsthand when I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the young age of 33. My journey has shown me the critical role that early detection and proactive health care play in saving lives,"" said Lopez. ""The troubling statistics regarding health habits within the Hispanic community deeply moved me — I want to urge my community to prioritize regular screenings to identify potential health concerns early and take charge of our well-being.""Story continues""The 'Remission with a Mission' campaign will blend Adamari's popularity with her authentic and inspiring journey to encourage proactive health care practices within the Hispanic community,"" said Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, senior vice president and chief communications officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""We need to bridge gaps, break down language barriers and empower individuals to take charge of their health. Together we will emphasize the value of early detection and promote regular health screenings. Like Adamari, Aflac is on a mission to help patients and families create better health habits.""Aflac's Wellness Matters Survey examined attitudes, habits and opinions about health and preventive care, uncovering that many adults are skipping wellness appointments and screenings that can help save their lives, including mammograms, blood tests, pap smears, STDs, skin cancer, and colonoscopies. These findings underscore the need for increased engagement and education within the U.S. Hispanic community, transcending language barriers and advocating for proactive health care practices.Additional insights from Aflac's Wellness Matters Survey:Loved ones carry high impact on promoting health: Many U.S. Hispanics (67%) say they benefit from friends and family who encourage them to go to the doctor for routine visits. Individuals are more likely to schedule checkups and prioritize wellness screenings as adults if their parents or caregivers demonstrated good habits, such as scheduling childhood wellness appointments, early in life.Gender dynamics: Hispanic men exhibit a more positive outlook on their current and future health compared to women.Generational divide: Younger generations, including Gen Z, feel less control over their health but are more likely to skip annual wellness visits.Aflac's collaboration with Adamari Lopez exemplifies its commitment to fostering a healthier future for the U.S. Hispanic community. Together, Aflac and Adamari are working to break down barriers, inspire positive change and prioritize wellness for all.

The recent leasing successes and targeted renovations have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands, and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target TGT, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.Eric Bunyan, the senior vice president of Leasing, East Region, for Macerich, emphasized the significance of these developments. He stated, “The tremendous success of the new Target at Kings Plaza, combined with strong performance for Primark, Zara and Burlington, each of which have been open since 2018 in the former Sears location, demonstrates the power and promise of Kings Plaza, Macerich’s well-located, fully enclosed retail center in Brooklyn.”Bunyan's enthusiasm is well-founded as these national brands selecting Kings Plaza underscore its appeal to diverse demographics, including affluent shoppers from the dynamic trade area.Macerich's approach to leasing, which focuses on creating properties that cater to a broader range of consumer needs, has proven effective. The addition of popular brands like Shake Shack and Ashley Furniture further enhances the shopping experience. Moreover, Macerich is exploring opportunities for a 50,000-square-foot location at the prime corner of Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U.The success of Kings Plaza is not solely attributable to leasing changes. Targeted renovations have also played a pivotal role. MAC's commitment to enhancing the customer experience is evident in the complete transformation of the front of Kings Plaza along Flatbush Avenue in 2018. This redevelopment included the former Sears store, and it served as a catalyst for the mall's resurgence.Recent improvements, such as brightening and lightening the attached parking deck, along with upgrades to lighting, furnishings and flooring on the center's second level, have further solidified Kings Plaza as one of the most successful shopping centers in the market.Kings Plaza, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and dining destination with a 10-level parking garage, has an impressive lineup of tenants, including Target, Primark, Zara, Burlington, Lowe's, Ashley Furniture, Sephora and many others. This diverse mix of retailers caters to a wide range of consumer preferences, making Kings Plaza a go-to destination for shopping and dining.Nevertheless, dwindling footfall, store closures and retailer bankruptcies were bothering the retail real estate industry in the past, and social distancing amid the pandemic further deteriorated the fundamentals, affecting retail REITs like Macerich, Simon Property Group SPG and Federal Realty FRT, among others. However, the renewed enthusiasm of shoppers seeking exclusive in-store shopping experiences after the pandemic has revived the fundamentals of this asset category, and Macerich, Simon Property and Federal Realty remain well-poised to benefit from strategic renovations and remerchandising.Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

During the second quarter of 2023, it signed 112 leases for 602,911 square feet of retail space. As of Jun 30, 2023, occupancy rates in the portfolio increased 80 basis points (bps) year over year to 92.8%.With consumer spending expected to remain healthy amid the rebounding retail real estate industry, we expect FRT to continue witnessing decent leasing activity in the forthcoming quarters. For 2023, our estimate for the leased occupancy rate is pegged at 94.3%.The company enjoys a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including industry bellwethers like TJX Companies, Kroger and CVS Corporation. This minimizes the risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues. As of Jun 30, 2023, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.70% of the annualized base rent (ABR), and the top 25 tenants accounted for only 24.45% of the ABR. For 2023, we estimate the company’s rental income to grow 4.9% year over year.Federal Realty’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with residential and office properties are likely to pay off well. Exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable the company to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, its expansion efforts into the premium markets and initiatives to redevelop and repurpose its assets seem encouraging.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, Federal Realty had redevelopment projects underway throughout the portfolio with a projected total cost of approximately $228 million, which it expects to stabilize over the next several years.On the balance sheet front, this retail REIT exited the second quarter of 2023 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity and an annualized net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.0. It also enjoys credit ratings of BBB+ and Baa1 ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively, rendering it access to the debt market at favorable costs. Hence, with a solid financial footing, FRT seems well-placed to bank on long-term growth opportunities.Nonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, growing e-commerce adoption may weigh on the prospects of Federal Realty, Kimco and Regency Centers. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, thus adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment, a slowdown in the economy and the depletion of savings could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters, stalling the company’s growth tempo to some extent. Also, the likelihood of tenant bankruptcies in the near term could affect FRT’s profitability and hurt occupancy.Further, given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Federal Realty may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. We anticipate a year-over-year rise of 20.7% in the company’s interest expenses in the current year.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

394,dcd67862-536e-3ed2-aa19-149c4b1a9d5f,UNP,2023-10-03,Government sues Union Pacific over using flawed test to disqualify color blind railroad workers,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-sues-union-pacific-over-194000112.html,1696275600,STORY,['UNP'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The federal government has joined more than a dozen former workers in suing Union Pacific over the way it used a vision test to disqualify workers the railroad believed were color blind and might have trouble reading signals telling them to stop a train.The lawsuit announced Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of 21 former workers is the first the government filed in what could eventually be hundreds — if not thousands — of lawsuits over the way Union Pacific disqualified people with a variety of health issues.These cases were once going to be part of a class-action lawsuit that the railroad estimated might include as many as 7,700 people who had to undergo what is called a “fitness-for-duty” review between 2014 and 2018.Lawyers for the plaintiffs estimate nearly 2,000 of those people faced restrictions that kept them off the job for at least two years if not indefinitely. But the railroad hasn't significantly changed its policies since making that estimate in an earlier legal filing, meaning the number has likely grown in the past five years. More than three dozen lawsuits have been filed so far with many more cases still being reviewed by the EEOC.Union Pacific has vigorously defended itself in court and refused to enter into settlement talks with the EEOC. The railroad has said it believes it was necessary to disqualify workers to ensure safety because it believed they had trouble seeing colors or developed health conditions such as seizures, heart problems or diabetes that could lead to them becoming incapacitated. They also noted federal rules require color vision testing.“It is critical for the safety of our employees and communities where we operate that conductors and locomotive engineers correctly see and interpret the various signals that direct train movement,” railroad spokeswoman Kristen South said.Often the railroad made its decisions after reviewing medical records and disqualified many even if their own doctors recommended they be allowed to return to work.Story continuesRailroad safety has been a key concern nationwide this year ever since a Norfolk Southern train derailed in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania line in February and spilled hazardous chemicals that caught fire, prompting evacuations in East Palestine. That wreck inspired a number of proposed reforms from Congress and regulators that have yet to be approved.“Everyone wants railroads to be safe,” said Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC’s Chicago District. “However, firing qualified, experienced employees for failing an invalid test of color vision does nothing to promote safety, and violates the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).”This lawsuit focuses on a vision test that Union Pacific developed called the “light cannon” test that involves asking workers to identify the color of a light on a device placed a quarter of a mile (.4 kilometers) away from the test taker. The EEOC said in its lawsuit that the test doesn't replicate real world conditions or show whether workers can accurately identify railroad signals.Some of the workers who sued had failed Union Pacific's “light cannon” test but passed another vision test that has the approval of the Federal Railroad Administration. The other workers who sued had failed both tests but presented medical evidence to the railroad that they didn't have a color vision problem that would keep them from identifying signals.The workers involved in the lawsuit were doing their jobs successfully for Union Pacific for between two and 30 years without any safety problems. The workers represented in the EEOC lawsuit worked for the company in Minnesota, Illinois, Arizona, Idaho, California, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington, and Texas.Attorney Anthony Petru, who represents a number of the former UP workers, said the “light cannon” test is so unreliable that the railroad's own experts have testified that it would disqualify a quarter of the workers with perfect vision.“The last thing we would do is take any steps to try to put anybody in charge of a freight train who is unsafe because of their physical characteristics,” Petru said. “What we don’t want is employees who are safe, who could do the job safely, who could do the job competently to be precluded from working because the railroad perceives them as having a disability when they don’t.”Petru said Union Pacific disqualified all these workers over these vision tests “without making the railroad safer in any way, shape or form” because there's no history of UP workers causing derailments or collisions when they couldn't discern between red and green.The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad is one of the nation's largest with tracks in 23 Western states.]"

However, over the past three years, Gap Inc's annual dividend growth rate has been -14.80%. The 5-year yield on cost of Gap Inc stock as of today stands at approximately 5.54%.Unraveling the Dividend Story of Gap Inc (GPS)Dividend Sustainability: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityThe sustainability of a dividend hinges on the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio reveals the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-07-31, Gap Inc's dividend payout ratio is 2.07, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable. Gap Inc's profitability rank is 7 out of 10, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 8 years out of the past 10 years.Story continuesGrowth Metrics: The Future OutlookFor dividends to be sustainable, a company must exhibit robust growth metrics. Gap Inc's growth rank of 7 out of 10 indicates a good growth trajectory relative to its competitors. However, Gap Inc's revenue per share and 3-year revenue growth rate indicate a revenue increase of approximately -0.60% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 62.36% of global competitors.ConclusionWhile Gap Inc has a consistent dividend payment record and a decent profitability rank, the negative dividend growth rate and low revenue growth rate could be areas of concern for investors. The sustainability of its dividends may be questionable given the high payout ratio. Therefore, investors must carefully consider these factors before making investment decisions.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Shares Could Be 29% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110049491.html,1696330849,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Cisco Systems fair value estimate is US$76.65Cisco Systems is estimated to be 29% undervalued based on current share price of US$54.39Our fair value estimate is 29% higher than Cisco Systems' analyst price target of US$59.55In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$16.6bUS$17.9bUS$17.0bUS$16.9bUS$17.5bUS$17.5bUS$17.7bUS$17.9bUS$18.1bUS$18.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.15%Est @ 0.75%Est @ 1.17%Est @ 1.47%Est @ 1.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$15.5kUS$15.6kUS$13.8kUS$12.9kUS$12.4kUS$11.6kUS$10.9kUS$10.3kUS$9.7kUS$9.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$122bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.2%) = US$377bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$377b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$189bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$311b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$54.4, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cisco Systems as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Cisco SystemsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Communications industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Communications market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

To skip our detailed analysis of the cloud computing industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy.Cloud Computing: An Area In Tech Worth Looking IntoThe information technology sector is one that has continued to exceed investor and analyst expectations during 2023. Developments such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI has primarily spearheaded the tech rally, bringing the stock prices for tech stocks higher than ever before. However, AI isn't the only area of tech that deserves investor attention at this moment. Another exciting field of development and investment is cloud computing, as individuals, corporations, and governments worldwide shift to a more digital future.According to tech experts and concerned professionals in the cloud computing space, this area of information technology is only just starting to grow. Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, joined CNBC in June 2022 to discuss this. Here are some of his comments from back then:""We've always said that in the fullness of time, it's possible that AWS could become the largest business at Amazon. Now Amazon has other large and great businesses and so it could take a while for us to get there, but I think that possibility is there. Essentially, IT is going to move to the cloud. It's gonna take a while, you've seen maybe only, call it 10% of IT today move to cloud. So it's still day one, it's still early.""Can Cloud Computing Grow To Greater Heights?Back then, Selipsky was noting that AWS was still in the course of its growth. A Bloomberg article from June 2022 later noted that this business alone was on track to achieve a $3 trillion valuation, which was almost three times its value back then, although it did not mention when this would be achieved. This is just one example of a cloud business that is expected to hit record highs in the near future. As the world is rapidly continuing to move towards the development of digital infrastructure, and as companies are committing themselves to move their information technology operations to the cloud, we can expect to see further growth and expansion in this market.Story continuesConsidering the above, cloud computing stocks such as Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc.

The rapid emergence of AI-assisted software development tools can speed innovation, allowing companies to produce more, richer apps at lower cost. In addition, companies are deploying AI tools as sales and marketing enablers—helping with both prospect targeting and client service. We believe the companies with modern technology infrastructures, proprietary data sets and adaptive cultures are best positioned to take advantage of these tools.We are focused on aligning with forward-thinking management teams who are investing to creatively deploy these capabilities.

(NYSE:TWLO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“We sold Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and thereby reduced our subsector weight in software. The company reported a decent third quarter, but disappointed on fourth quarter 2022, full year 2023, and long-term guidance. The company is seeing macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown spreading from technology, social media and cryptocurrency to retail and e-commerce. The other negative disclosure and a driver of this gross margin “miss” was that Twilio’s software sales are not accelerating at the rate that we expected. We are disappointed with this lower topline and low operating margin improvement guidance. The business transformation is taking longer than expected, and there is the heightened possibility that the new software growth could be stifled by more formidable competition as Twilio has made too many missteps.”13.

Concerns over increased competition and share loss in its core verticals led us to exit our position during the quarter as we made several moves to add to existing higher-conviction holdings or initiate new positions that we find more compelling in the long term.”11.

Our view is that subscription growth can meaningfully outperform current estimates through cross-selling to customers that are looking to consolidate vendors, acquiring customers in emerging areas such as mid-sized and international companies, implementing price increases as renewals come due and increasing adoption of its financial management offering among the Fortune 500 customer base.”8.

(NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”6.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”Like Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a highly popular cloud computing stock to invest in.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks Heading into 2024.Suggested articles:10 Cloud Computing Stocks to Watch25 Biggest Cloud Providers by RevenueTop 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Best Cloud Computing Stocks Heading into 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
