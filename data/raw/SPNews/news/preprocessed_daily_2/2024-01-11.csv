Charlie would say don’t avoid mistakes because they are inevitable. Instead, focus on repeating what works.', 'Notably, I sold The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in March. Now that some time has passed, I’ll share how I approached the decision. In March, Charles Schwab stock declined ~25% during the banking challenges that crippled First Republic Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. Schwab has some similarities in that it is a bank (investing idle cash in their customers’ accounts allows them to charge less for other products and services) and had invested in bonds during the low interest rate years that would be worth less if Schwab needed to liquidate today. Also, Schwab clients were leaving less cash in their accounts favoring higher interest alternatives that were a more expensive cost of funds for Schwab. However, Schwab had many positives relative to the troubled banks such as limited uninsured deposits and sticky assets. For example, investment advisors such as Right Tail who custody at Schwab have limited options. It would be a hassle (though quite doable) to switch to a different custodian (and I would absolutely make the change if I thought it was in the best interest of our investors). I carefully considered the pros and cons. Something had changed in that I had always considered Schwab to be a beneficiary of rising interest rates – now the company was rooting for lower rates in the intermediate term. I thought Schwab may have to raise capital to deal with their short-term liquidity challenges (they indirectly raised capital by pausing their stock repurchase program). I also thought regulators may ask more of Schwab as an important institution that no one wants to fail. Positively, I was still rooting for Schwab and thought they’d continue to be a blue chip brokerage firm that would likely keep taking share over time.', 'Ultimately, I felt my time and energy would be better spent trying to find the next great Right Tail investment than in trying to untangle Schwab. I sold the stock in the mid to high $50s and used the proceeds to add to our existing positions that I felt best about. I estimate that owning Schwab reduced our returns by less than 100 bps since inception and ~250 bps for 2023.""', 'A corporate finance professional studying a financial performance chart.', 'The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of\xa030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have declined on a year-over-year basis.In the third quarter of 2023, Schwab’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from the solid performance of the asset management business. However, a fall in revenues due to higher funding costs and lower volatility posed a major headwind.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and missed in one of the trailing four quarters.', '\xa0', 'The Charles Schwab Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation Quote', 'Schwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been unchanged at 68 cents per share. The estimate indicates a decline of 36.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pinned at 66 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.54 billion, which indicates a fall of 17.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is pinned at $4.42 billion.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s fourth-quarter performance.', 'While the risk of a near-term recession faded in the fourth quarter, ambiguity among investors remained on lingering concerns related to high inflation and other geopolitical issues. Because of this, there was not much volatility seen in the markets. Client activity remained subdued, because of which, trading volumes were relatively low in the quarter.In addition to these macro factors, Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been impacted by the temporary attrition of TD Ameritrade clients and advisors.In October and November, SCHW’s core net new assets declined 73% and 34% from the respective prior-year months. Thus, Schwab is expected to have witnessed a decline in trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for trading revenues is pegged at $777 million, which suggests a decline of 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is pinned at $724.8 million, indicating a decline of 19%.Coming to net interest revenues, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $440 billion, which suggests a decline of 17.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.While interest rates continued to remain high, the Federal Reserve paused rate hikes in December, indicating no further hikes this cycle. Thus, because of weaker loan demand, SCHW’s interest income is not expected to have improved much. Moreover, higher funding costs are likely to have put pressure on margin growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest revenues is pegged at $2.22 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 26.7%. Our estimate for the metric is $2.29 billion.Nevertheless, the consensus estimate for Schwab’s asset management and administration fees of $1.25 billion implies a rise of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We project the metric to rise 1.8% to $1.07 billion.Because of lower transactional cash levels, subdued client trading volumes and muted securities lending activity, the company expects 2023 revenues to decline 9.5-10% year over year, changed from the previously mentioned 8-9% fall.Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses of $3.05 billion for the quarter, implying a rise of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Management expects one-time FDIC special assessment costs to impact GAAP and adjusted expenses by $160 million in the fourth quarter. Thus, 2023 GAAP expense growth of 9% and adjusted expense growth of 6% are expected.', 'According to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

Focusing on stocks that have proven themselves over time via a steadily increasing dividend is a good first step."", 'If those companies also happen to be industry leaders, all the better. Here are three such companies that, when they go on sale, you should probably consider adding to your portfolio.', 'Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) has a market cap of over $340 billion, making it one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. It has the scale to invest heavily in advertising, distribution, and -- perhaps most important -- research and development.', 'It tends to be a leader in the industry when it comes to launching new and improved versions of products like toothpaste, toilet paper, and deodorant. Consumers love the words new and improved, and retailers love that such products draw customers into their stores, which makes P&G a valuable supplier.', ""Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend annually for 67 years. The average annual increase over the past decade was around 5%, which isn't huge but is more than enough to keep the buying power of its dividend growing faster than inflation."", ""The problem is that the yield is around 2.5%, which is the middle of the road for P&G. This suggests that the stock isn't cheap today, which is not a shock, given its industry-leading position in the consumer staples space because many of its brands sit at the high end of the price spectrum. However, if the stock price were to take a notable dip, even the most conservative investors should consider adding P&G to their portfolios."", ""Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is one of the largest steel makers in North America. It also has one of the most diversified product portfolios in the industry. Add in a structural advantage because it uses more modern electric arc mini-mills that can be more easily ramped up and down with demand than older blast furnaces, and there's a lot to like about this company."", 'It also has a vertically integrated business model and great relations with its employees, who are largely non-union. Still, investors need to remember a very simple fact: Steel is a highly cyclical industry.', ""That just makes the company's status as a Dividend King, with 50 years of annual dividend increases, all the more impressive. The average annual dividend increase over the past decade was 3%, which is roughly in line with inflation."", 'This is one of the reasons why investors will want to wait until the stock takes a sizable dip before buying. The dividend yield today is around 1.2%, which is pretty modest. Given the cyclical nature of the steel sector, however, patient long-term investors should wait and only buy this industry leader when Wall Street is throwing the baby out with the bathwater in an economic downturn.', 'Compared to oil and natural gas, steel looks like a calm sea. Supply and demand, geopolitical tensions, government interventions, and the OPEC oil cartel can all rattle the energy sector in a swift and dramatic fashion.', ""This is why ExxonMobil's (NYSE: XOM) 41 consecutive annual dividend increases are so impressive. The average increase over the past decade was a bit over 4%."", ""One of the keys to ExxonMobil's dividend consistency is the company's strong balance sheet, with a very modest debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2 times. When oil prices are weak, ExxonMobil adds debt so it can keep paying the dividend and invest in its business. When oil prices recover, as they have always done historically, it pays off that debt."", ""It's been a winning formula for dividend investors. The yield today is around 3.7%, which is the most attractive on this list. However, during oil downturns, it can get much, much higher."", ""There's no one right way to pick a stock, but if you're a conservative income-focused investor, going with industry-leading stocks is a good starting point. If they also happen to have decades of annual dividend increases behind them, all the better."", ""The problem is that such stocks, which include P&G, Nucor, and ExxonMobil, don't go on sale all that often. This is why you want to prepare ahead of time by putting these companies on your wish list, just in case their stocks take a big dip.

Many saw their holdings hammered first by the pandemic and then by rising interest rates.', 'These real estate dividend stocks need to borrow to grow because their obligation is to pass most of their taxable income on to shareholders as dividends. This makes it difficult for these pools of income-producing properties to retain the cash they need to buy more, well, income-producing properties. The period of high inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 and early 2023 was particularly hard on the industry', 'But as recession fears began to fade and the Federal Reserve has indicated it may cut rates this year, REITs have rallied even more than the overall market, as the chart below shows.', 'Despite that run-up, there are still good opportunities for nice gains in 2024. Here are three of my favorites.', ""AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) is a mortgage REIT. That means it doesn't directly own real estate but instead invests in residential mortgage-backed securities pooled into bonds and sold by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other issuers."", 'Mortgage REITs typically provide much higher yields than equity REITs, and while such a high return might seem like risky yield-chasing, AGNC has paid in the 10% to 15% rate nearly every year since its initial public offering in May 2008, rising as high as 24% and dipping no lower than 8%. ', ""And it's realistic to expect a bump in price this year, perhaps especially when the Fed makes the first of its possible interest rate cuts this year. After all, falling rates tend to boost bond prices. Analysts give AGNC a target price of $10.21, which would represent a 3% jump from its current level of about $9.90."", 'While AGNC is by no means a growth stock, as its total return in the chart below shows, it does pay monthly, making it a nice choice for passive income investors such as retirees.', 'Like AGNC, Agree Realty (NYSE: ADC) pays monthly dividends, but its income comes from a completely different business. This retail REIT owns and operates a portfolio now numbering 2,135 properties in 49 states.', ""Walmart is Agree's leading tenant, accounting for 6.2% of the rent right now, but overall, it's a diversified roster, with no other retailer responsible for more than 5% of the rent roll."", ""Nearly 70% of the tenants are recession-resistant, investment-grade companies, with grocery and home improvement stores accounting for 9.7% and 8.6% of Agree's rental income, respectively, according to the company's January 2024 investor presentation."", 'Agree is also expanding, using its own investment-grade credit to finance what it expects to be $1.3 billion in acquisitions when 2023 totals are released soon. That includes 232 new properties in 37 states and 25 retail sectors in the first three quarters of the past year.', ""Analysts see an upside of about 4% in their average target price of $66.36 for Agree shares, which currently sell for about $64. That's a pretty modest gain, but given Agree's popularity among REIT investors, it wouldn't surprise me if its stock doesn't repeat or edge past its 52-week high of $75.71 if and when interest rates are cut."", 'Agree also yields a nice 4.7% after increasing its dividend by about 6% a year for the past decade, including six increases since it began paying monthly in January 2021.', ""Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE: ARE) is a major owner of laboratory and research-related office space on what it calls collaborative campuses in and around San Diego, Silicon Valley, Seattle, North Carolina's Research Triangle, the District of Columbia, New York City, and Boston."", ""This trust's stock has endured a double whammy in recent years. After first rising sharply during the depths of the pandemic, Alexandria shares tanked when interest rates started ratcheting up and the office sector in general fell out of favor as the realization sank in that millions of people simply were staying home to work."", ""But this is a well-seasoned REIT, a pioneer in its niche that has a list of hundreds of clients anchored by major biopharma companies, universities, and government institutions whose employees can't easily do what they do by working remotely. The stock is still trading about 40% below its three-year high, pointing to a profitable opportunity ahead if this perception corrects. "", 'Analysts give Alexandria a nod with an average target price of $143.11, a 12% upside from the $128 or so the stock was selling for in the first week of January. At that level, the yield is about 4% from a dividend that has been boosted for 14 straight years, including by about 5.4% a year over the past three.', 'The chart above shows how these three stocks have performed in total return in the past 15 years (AGNC went public in May 2008) compared with each other and with the greater market as benchmarked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.', ""Will that continue? Past performance doesn't guarantee that, but these REITs are positioned to maintain their momentum while taking advantage of falling rates to expand their portfolios and income, lending some confidence to investors seeking a profitable 2024 and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in AGNC Investment Corp. right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp., consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AGNC Investment Corp. wasn't one of them.

"", ""Innovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth.

All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.', ""Apple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022."", ""However, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market."", ""While most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets."", ""Looking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.5%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $6.83 billion, up 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.49% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?', ""For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.24%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of +0.96%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'U.S. Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Citigroup (C), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.01 for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -8.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $18.84 billion, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.', 'The consensus EPS estimate for Citigroup has been revised 1.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -34.45%.', 'When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Citigroup will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

But even after the cut, Walgreens yields 4%. And investors might be eyeing the stock as a potential turnaround play now that management has lowered one of its higher expenses and freed up cash to improve the business.', ""However, weak fundamentals and declining earnings make Walgreens too risky for the potential reward. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are five better Dow dividend stocks to buy now."", ""Apple yields just 0.5%, but that's a result of its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to its dividend."", 'Management has raised its dividend every year since 2012. And over the past 10 years, its dividend has more than doubled while its outstanding share count has fallen 37.7% thanks to buybacks.', ""Apple's cash-cow business model allows it to make dividend raises and buy back stock even during a slowdown, which we've seen play out over the last couple of years."", ""It's a good dividend stock for investors who value a quality business, buybacks, and dividend raises more than a high yield."", 'Like Apple, P&G is not purely a dividend play. It also has a sizable buyback program. And the business is as solid as ever.', 'The stock underperformed the market big time in 2023. Patient investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy a quality business at a good valuation.', 'P&G is one of the best-run businesses out there and arguably the single strongest business in the entire consumer staples sector. It has impeccable pricing power and industry-leading products across a wide variety of categories, including beauty; grooming; healthcare; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care.', ""Management has a track record of developing brands. The company's performance in fiscal 2023 proved that brands really do matter, even for everyday household products like laundry detergent, paper towels, razors, and more."", 'P&G operates a high-margin business, with recession resilience and a diversified business model. The only question investors should ask before buying the stock is whether it is expensive. At a 23.9 price-to-earnings ratio, it is trading around the same multiple as the S&P 500 -- which is reasonable for such a high-quality business even though it is growing slowly.', 'Like P&G, Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. It is one of the most reliable healthcare income stocks out there.', 'But the J&J of today is different than the J&J of the past, mainly because it spun off its consumer-healthcare products into a new company called Kenvue. The idea is that the ""new"" J&J will grow faster, with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.', 'Dividend Kings are known for their reliability, not for chasing growth. But J&J should have no trouble raising its dividend even with a more growth-orientated business. The company is a cash cow, generating far more free cash flow every year than it uses to pay the dividend.', ""J&J also has one of the strongest balance sheets, with total net long-term debt of a mere $6.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for a company with a market cap of $388 billion."", 'With a 3% dividend yield, a reliable business model, and a phenomenal balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend stock that investors can count on in 2024 and beyond.', 'Walmart is another example where the quality of the business, not the yield, is the primary focus. Its shares yield just 1.5% -- which is far less appealing than a stock like J&J.', 'But Walmart is also a Dividend King. It tends to make small dividend raises, choosing instead to reinvest and grow the business.', ""Perhaps Walmart's greatest quality is its ability to perform in a challenging environment. The business is all about undercutting the competition with the lowest prices and providing the best value for its customers. When the economy is faltering, or there's a changing business climate, it is a safe haven with the sophisticated supply chain needed to take market share."", 'Recent conditions provide a good stress test:', ""The company's results have been excellent, even as consumers have shifted from discretionary categories to staples. Walmart doesn't have nearly the same exposure to discretionary categories as its competitors, like Target. Years of long-term investments and expansions, paired with precise execution throughout this challenging time, have helped Walmart put up solid results, given the circumstances."", 'Walmart is the perfect stock for investors looking for a company that is less dependent on a strong economy to do well.', 'Coming in with a 4% dividend yield and nonstop annual payout raises since 1990, Chevron is an underrated dividend stock. It might not generate the consistent cash flow that Walmart, J&J, or P&G do. But it has an incredibly strong balance sheet and can fund the dividend and its operations even when oil is $50 a barrel.', 'Chevron is also geographically diversified and includes much more than just the upstream side of the industry. It has a sizable downstream business and is investing in low-carbon efforts.', ""It can do incredibly well and generate outsize profits when oil is a relatively high or even mediocre price like today's $78 Brent crude per-barrel price. That upside potential, paired with a large margin for error, makes Chevron a reliable income stock in a volatile sector."", 'Apple, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, and Chevron are five completely different companies in five different industries. But all five Dow stocks are components for a reason.', 'Each company should be able to fund dividend raises by growing its business. It sounds simple, but often we see powerful companies gradually lose their edge to competition. Or in the case of Walgreens, it lost market share and sustained ill-fated dividend raises for far too long.', ""All 30 Dow components are meant to represent their respective sector as a role model. Apple, P&G, J&J, Walmart, and Chevron do that well, which can't be said for every Dow stock. All five stocks are worth buying in January for investors looking for quality businesses they can count on, no matter what the new year brings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The lawsuit alleges that Meta exposes young users to sexual content and makes it possible for adult users they don’t know to contact them, putting children at risk of abuse or exploitation.', 'Wednesday’s filing alleges that Match Group cut its advertising spending on Meta’s platforms over its concerns. The claims that advertisers have raised such concerns to Meta — and that Match cut its spending — marks a potentially serious risk to the tech giant’s core advertising business.', '“We don’t want this kind of content on our platforms and brands don’t want their ads to appear next to it,” Meta said in a statement from spokesperson Andy Stone. “We continue to invest aggressively to stop it — and report every quarter on the prevalence of such content, which remains very low. Our systems are effective at reducing violating content, and we’ve invested billions in safety, security and brand suitability solutions.”', 'Walmart said in a statement to CNN that it takes “brand safety issues extremely seriously, and protecting our customers and communities will always be a top priority.”', 'Match Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'Wednesday’s complaint cites an alleged email exchange between Match and Meta late last year in which the dating company asked how Meta prevented its ads from running next to inappropriate content. Meta tells advertisers that its technology prevents ads from appearing next to content that is “excessively controversial or offensive, such as full nudity, excessive violence, terrorist acts, or misinformation,” and by touting its additional “brand suitability controls” available to advertisers, the complaint states.', 'However, Match informed Meta that its ads had run alongside a series of Instagram Reels videos showing “young girls, including a ‘[y]oung girl provocatively dressed, straddling and caressing a Harley Davidson-style motorcycle,’” as well as next to a Facebook group “showing films of women being murdered,” according to the complaint.', 'Meta responded saying it had removed some of the flagged content, including the group, the complaint states.', 'Match Group’s CEO also allegedly reached out directly to Zuckerberg to note that “Meta is placing ads adjacent to offensive, obscene – and potentially illegal – content, including sexualization of minors and gender-based violence,” and said that Match had cut its advertising spending on Meta’s platforms. Zuckerberg has not yet responded to the message, the complaint states.', 'Walmart also repeatedly raised concerns to Meta last year about where its ads were being shown, including following a November report by The Wall Street Journal indicating that an advertisement for the retailer was shown after an explicit video of a woman, the complaint alleges.', '“It is extremely disappointing that this type of content exists on Meta, and it is unacceptable for Walmart’s brand to appear anywhere near it,” the company said in an email to Meta, according to the complaint.', 'Meta moved to dismiss the New Mexico lawsuit last month, arguing the complaint failed to state a claim. The tech giant also cited its protections under a law known as Section 230, which shields tech companies from being held accountable for content that users post on their sites.', 'The New Mexico lawsuit is part of growing pressure on Meta to address alleged harm to young users of Facebook and Instagram.', 'The social media giant has been sued by various school districts and state attorneys general in lawsuits related to youth mental health, child safety and privacy. Former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Arturo Bejar also told a Senate subcommittee in November that Meta’s top executives, including Zuckerberg, ignored warnings for years about harm to teens on its platforms.', 'Meta has strongly and repeatedly denied claims that its platforms put children at risk. The company on Wednesday announced new youth safety efforts, including content restrictions and new blocked search terms, that add to its existing slate of more than 30 well-being and parental oversight tools.', 'Still, Torrez claims the company is not doing enough to protect young users.', '“Mr. Zuckerberg and Meta are refusing to be honest and transparent about what is taking place on Meta’s platforms,” Torrez said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “New Mexico’s complaint alleges that, for years, they have misled the public about children’s inappropriate and dangerous experiences on Facebook and Instagram.”', 'Wednesday’s complaint also alleges that Meta executives have for years known that child predators were using Facebook to groom victims and failed to act.', 'It claims that as far back as 2018, Facebook employees raised alarms to senior executives that the platform was aiding child predators in connecting with children and suggested solutions to address the issue that were rejected.', 'In particular, the “People You May Know” feature was responsible for suggesting to adult users the accounts of children that matched search terms they’d previously used, such as “children in their geographic area,” the complaint alleges. In a Wall Street Journal report about the issue in December, Meta’s Stone told the newspaper that the employee concerns had prompted new work at the company to avoid recommending teen accounts to suspicious adults.', 'The complaint also alleges that “Forums on the dark web devoted to child sex abuse … show open conversations about the role of Instagram’s and Facebook’s algorithms in delivering children to predators.”', 'In one instance viewed by the attorney general’s investigators, one participant in the chat forum discussed having been followed by a 10-year-old girl on Instagram and said they were considering sending her a direct message.', '“Do you think I’m getting in trouble,” the participant asked on the forum, according to the complaint. Another participant responded, “you see how the baby reacts! On Instagram it is very easy to just ask for a couple of intimate photos and then send your own and if you like each other go to a meeting in a cozy place,” the complaint states.', 'The new claims come as Zuckerberg is set to testify later this month at a Senate subcommittee hearing on youth safety online, alongside representatives from TikTok, Snapchat, Discord and X.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

The company said it’s implementing it in everything from its supply chain to its app, along with developments to drone delivery and shopping at Sam’s Club.', 'It’s important to note that Walmart has not rolled out its plans nationwide yet. Many of its announcements are currently in select markets, though the company said it plans to roll them out this year.', 'Walmart has already made 20,000 drone deliveries in the past two years, but in 2024 it is going all in on the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. The superstore announced that it is offering drone delivery for up to 75%\xa0of the Dallas area’s population, or about 1.8 million homes.', 'But drone delivery as a concept isn’t new, and Walmart’s timeline to take off in Dallas is remarkably short.', 'Amazon founder Jeff Bezos revealed delivery drones on “60 Minutes” nearly a decade ago, but the technology has long faced regulatory, technical and financial problems for tech companies.', 'While companies from UPS to Volkswagen initially started out bullish on using drones for their business supply chains, hurdles have remained and stymied tech delivery for both smaller startups and huge retailers like Amazon or pharmacy chains.', 'The money at stake is substantial: A Fortune Business Insights\xa0report has estimated that the commercial drone market will balloon to nearly $47.4 billion by 2029.', 'First, however, companies must navigate regulations, consumer skepticism and the actual safe return of their technology.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration regulates commercial drone deliveries, and they have high standards to meet.', 'For example, CNBC reported last year that FAA required Amazon’s Prime Air to complete hundreds of hours of flying without incidents and submit data to the agency before a broader rollout, and that was after it allowed clearance for testing.', 'Walmart has similarly ambitious plans. Its delivery expansion includes 30 towns and municipalities, which the retailer says will lead the retail industry.', 'Drone deliveries take between 10 to 30 minutes, the company said. Around 75% of the 120,000 items in the superstore meet the size and weight requirements for a drone delivery, Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of innovation and automation for Walmart US, said during the presentation.', 'Amazon’s Prime Air said it wants to expand drone delivery to Italy and the UK by the end of 2024, as well as a third US state.', 'Walmart is partnering with drone startups\xa0Wing\xa0and\xa0Zipline, according to a press release.', 'One of the most universal experiences of Sam’s Club shopping — showing your receipt before leaving the store — will soon be no more.', 'Using AI and computer vision technology, the new exit tech builds on its established “Scan & Go” feature on Sam’s Club’s app. In Scan & Go, customers scan their items on the mobile app as they go through the store and pay on the app, bypassing the checkout line.', 'Walmart didn’t specify how AI would be used, but said it would be “working in the background to continually speed the process.”', 'Amazon launched a similar concept in 2016 with its Go stores in 2016, its checkout free system hailed as the future of shopping. But by March 2023, it had closed eight of its 29 cashier-free stores, another sign of the tech giant’s cost-cutting efforts last year.', 'Technology at the exit takes images of carts and verifies payment for all the products in real time. It’s currently running as a pilot in 10 Sam’s Club locations, but the company plans to expand the technology to all of its locations by the end of the year.', 'Through a partnership with Microsoft, Walmart said it is revamping its generative AI usage. Generative artificial intelligence\xa0— the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools —\xa0is the latest buzzword in tech, but its practical applications remain untested.', 'The company didn’t announce any new ventures, but said it was using AI to build on its existing app and InHome service.', 'Walmart launched the GenAi search experience for Apple customers on Tuesday, who have the latest version of the app.', 'Normally, customers who need to shop for a Super Bowl party search for items on the Walmart app individually, the company said. With GenAi search, they can instead search “football watch party” and shop every relevant item they need in the search.', 'Walmart also announced advancements in its InHome service, which it debuted in 2019 to deliver groceries straight into customer’s refrigerators.', 'Walmart employees wear a camera when they enter customer homes, allowing the customer to watch the process live. The customers have to use an existing smart lock, a garage keypad or a smart lock from InHome.', 'The program has had some hiccups.', 'Walmart already uses a network of independent contract drivers on its in-house Spark delivery platforms, which Walmart said in June 2023 operates in all 50 states. Business Insider interviewed Spark drivers, who said customers would get confused their deliver for InHome delivery, asking drivers to bring the products inside the house.', 'The new replenishment tool for InHome uses AI to anticipate needs and orders. The company said its “algorithm learns what customers purchase regularly, how much of these items they purchase and the frequency of those purchases.”', 'Amazon Key has a rival in-garage delivery, which is exclusive for Prime members, compatible with certain smart garages. The service costs $1.99 per order for a one to two day delivery time.', 'Walmart’s InHome currently costs $19.95 a month or $138 a year.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Microchip Technology is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.26 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$17b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Microchip Technology has an ROCE of 26%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Microchip Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Microchip Technology here  for free."", ""You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Microchip Technology. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 306% over the trailing five years. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. In regards to capital employed, Microchip Technology appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 20% less capital to run its operation. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company."", ""From what we've seen above, Microchip Technology has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 146% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Microchip Technology can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", ""Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Microchip Technology   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about."", 'If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

However, the rebels have increasingly targeted ships with tenuous or no ties to Israel."", 'Meanwhile, satellite tracking data analyzed by the AP on Thursday showed that an Iranian cargo vessel suspected of being a spying platform in the Red Sea had left the waterway. The data showed the Behshad had transited through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait into the Gulf of Aden.', 'The Behshad has been in the Red Sea since 2021 off Eritrea’s Dahlak archipelago.

After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.', 'Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.', 'On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.', 'Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception.

Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.', 'Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.', 'An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates.

And, when it comes to investing in their first home, they may find the best luck in some unexpected places. In its most recent report, Realtor.com® unveiled the Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers in 2024. This year's ranking includes Irondequoit, N.Y.; Benton, Ark.; Winterset, Iowa; Newington, Conn.; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Cheektowaga, N.Y.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Moore, Okla.; Mattydale, N.Y. and Riviera Beach, Md."", '""Buying a first home can be a daunting task. Couple high interest rates with historically low inventory of homes available for sale in 2023 and hopeful buyers have faced a particularly challenging market,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. ""While affordability will remain an issue in 2024, a recent Realtor.com® survey showed that 95% of prospective first-time homebuyers overwhelmingly feel that they\'ll be able to afford a home within their lifetime, with 40% saying they\'ll be able to afford it within the next year.""', 'The Realtor.com® analysis of Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers uncovers a collection of small to mid-size towns and cities that are hidden gems of opportunity where affordability meets healthy inventory, culture and liveliness, lower than average commute times, forecasted price growth, and good company of similar-aged peers.', ""Affordability\xa0- As one of the biggest purchases consumers will make in their lives, affordability is a major decision driver. In its analysis, Realtor.com® looked at listing prices compared to gross household incomes of 25- to 34-year-olds in a city for the past 12 months to understand home affordability. A lower ratio indicates a more affordable place to live. The top markets in this year's list had an average 2023 listing price to income ratio of 3.1 compared to the national rate of 5.4. Additionally, homes in these towns/cities had an average median listing price that is 42% lower than the national median of $382,000. Within the top 10 list, Mattydale, N.Y., was the most affordable market relative to local incomes for 25–34-year-olds."", ""Investing in growth - Buying a home is not only a large investment up front, it's a commitment for the duration of ownership, which means investing in the ongoing upkeep and maintenance of the home. Naturally, first-time home buyers are looking for homes that fit everything they want, but also provide opportunities for their investment to grow. The top markets are located within metro areas that have an average forecasted 2024 home price growth rate of 6.1%, which is considerably higher than the national expected decline of -1.7%. Irondequoit, N.Y., is located in the metro area with the highest expected median sale price growth rate (10.4%)."", 'Options to buy - At a time marked by chronically low inventory levels, the top markets had an average count of 40.2 active listings per 1,000 existing households in 2023, and one area in particular, Riviera Beach, Md., had the most active listings per household (59.3 per 1,000) across the list of top 10.', ""Things to do\xa0- It's not only about the house but what surrounds it, and first-time buyers are keen on finding areas that have plenty of things to do. The top places on this year's list have great options for restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping, and entertainment businesses such as theaters, comedy clubs, and arts classes per point of interest data provided by Yelp. As a group, the top cities and towns have 16.6 of these businesses per 1,000 households, slightly higher than the overall city/town average of 15.6. However, Cheektowaga, N.Y.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Newington, Conn. particularly shine, with a ratio higher than 19 per 1,000 households."", ""Shorter commutes -\xa0The time it takes getting to and from work is a major consideration for home buyers, especially as return to office becomes more prevalent. With an average expected 2024 commute time of 24 minutes for the top cities on this year's list, they clock in at less than the city/town average of 30 minutes and the national rate of 29 minutes – saving commuters about 50 hours per year for a 5-day commuter. Mattydale, N.Y., has the lowest average commute time to work, at 20 minutes."", ""Youthful towns - Along with having things to do, first-time buyers may want to be close to people in similar life stages and around the same ages. The share of homeowners between the ages of 25 and 34 in this year's top markets is 8.1%, well above the national average of 5.4%. Among the top 10 cities and towns, Riviera Beach,\xa0Md., is expected to have the largest share of young adult homeowners (10.9%), which may prove to be a hot spot for the next generation of first-time home buyers."", 'Realtor.com® Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers Ranked', 'Rank', 'Place Name', 'Metro Name', 'Region', '2024 Forecasted 25-34 Homeowner Share of Households', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Inventory', 'per 1000 Household', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Median Listing Price', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Price to Income Ratio', '2024 Forecasted Average Travel Time to Work (Minutes)', 'November 2023 Yelp Culture and Lifestyle Businesses per 1000 Households', '1', 'Irondequoit, NY', 'Rochester, NY', 'Northeast', '8.2\xa0%', '34.1', '$187,000', '2.5', '22', '14.9', '2', 'Benton, AR', 'Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR', 'South', '7.6\xa0%', '50.2', '$197,500', '3.0', '25', '17.9', '3', 'Winterset, IA', 'Des Moines-West Des Moines, IA', 'Midwest', '7.3\xa0%', '47.8', '$269,400', '4.0', '23', '18.0', '4', 'Newington, CT', 'Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT', 'Northeast', '6.6\xa0%', '37.8', '$290,294', '3.4', '23', '19.2', '5', 'Council Bluffs, IA', 'Omaha-Council Bluffs, NE-IA', 'Midwest', '6.4\xa0%', '37.6', '$200,000', '3.0', '21', '13.0', '6', 'Cheektowaga, NY', 'Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, NY', 'Northeast', '7.2\xa0%', '26.6', '$199,000', '3.1', '21', '22.6', '7', 'Grand Rapids, MI', 'Grand Rapids-Wyoming, MI', 'Midwest', '9.5\xa0%', '33.1', '$260,000', '4.3', '21', '20.0', '8', 'Moore, OK', 'Oklahoma City, OK', 'South', '9.7\xa0%', '43.6', '$231,475', '3.2', '26', '14.1', '9', 'Mattydale, NY', 'Syracuse, NY', 'Northeast', '7.4\xa0%', '31.6', '$138,450', '2.0', '20', '9.2', '10', 'Riviera Beach, MD', 'Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD', 'South', '10.9\xa0%', '59.3', '$264,079', '2.7', '33', '16.7', '', 'USA', '', '', '5.4\xa0%', '38.6', '$382,230', '5.4', '29', '', '\xa0', 'Complete details of\xa0the report can be found on Realtor.com®, along with a First-Time Home Buyers Resource Center, multiple guides on mortgages and tools like a RealCost™\xa0Buying Power Tool\xa0to help prospective buyers understand how much house they can afford.', ""MethodologyThis year, the candidate list of places was filtered to only expose areas with an expected 2024 population of at least 5,000.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Micron Technology, Inc. (c) and The Southern Company (SO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Shares of Johnson & Johnson have gained +3.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +17.3%. The company due to the separation of the Consumer Health unit, has now become a two-sector company focused on the Innovative Medicine and MedTech fields.Growth in the Innovative Medicine unit is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. However, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure persist. Though J&J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation, uncertainty exists regarding the talc litigations.(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)Micron Technology’s shares were in line with the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+31.4% vs. +31.4%). The company’s better-than-expected first-quarter performance, along with sequential growth across all key metrics, reflects the benefits of an improving supply-demand environment and signals that the industrywide sluggish period is nearing its end, and the company is moving back to profitability.The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in artificial intelligence spending is expected to fuel demand for its chips used in the data center end market. A rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers as well.Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage. However, the United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>>)Southern Company’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past six months (+3.7% vs. -4.7%). The company is leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, as in healthy population and job growth, the utility has gradually increased its customer base.With good rate-base growth and constructive regulations, the power supplier is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years. However, its elevated leverage, along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project, are major overhangs.While the electric utility holding company’s debt-to-capitalization of 62.6% restricts financial flexibility, its $25-billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule.

Long known as a designer of semiconductors for personal computers (PCs), gaming devices, and servers, AMD is directly challenging Nvidia's dominance of the AI chip market by introducing its new MI300 series of chips. "", 'Although it\'s still to be determined whether AMD can take significant market share from Nvidia, it is clear that both companies have plenty of room in the lucrative AI market. Indeed, in an interview last month, AMD CEO Lisa Su said as much herself, noting: ""There are going to be multiple winners in this market ... customer demand is very high. We continue to work with our customers to deploy as quickly as possible.""', 'In turn, expectations are rising. Wall Street now expects AMD to grow revenue 17% over this year to $26.4 billion -- an all-time high.

Palantir caters its services to organizations awash in data. And in today's world, the number of those organizations is rising rapidly. "", 'Indeed, Palantir counts many governments, hospitals, banks, pharmaceutical companies, and educational institutions among its clients.', ""The company uses AI to help clients sift through data, look for trends, and spot patterns. While much of the company's defense work -- roughly 50% of revenue -- is understandably opaque, the other 50% is commercial. Examples include helping hospitals create dynamic schedules for staff and driving operational efficiencies for transportation companies."", ""Palantir recorded $2.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, with quarterly revenue increasing by 17% year over year. What's more, analysts expect sales to accelerate in 2024. According to estimates, Palantir's revenue should rise to $2.7 billion, up 20% from last year."", 'Nevertheless, Palantir is not for every investor. While the company is profitable, its lofty valuation (shares trade with a price-to-earnings multiple above 200) will put it out of reach for value-oriented investors, and the company pays no dividend, making it unappealing for those seeking income from their investments.', 'However, for those investors looking for a growth stock with solid fundamentals and a long runway of growth ahead of it, Palantir is a stock worth considering.', ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) rounds out my list of millionaire-maker AI stocks. The company, which is now neck and neck with Apple as the world's largest company by market cap, may benefit more than any other organization from the AI revolution."", 'First off, the company\'s close partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI has grown even closer in the weeks since OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired and then rehired. A new OpenAI board of directors is taking shape, with reports naming Microsoft Vice President Dee Templeton as a new ""observing"" board member.', ""In other words, Microsoft's influence at OpenAI continues to grow stronger, which puts the company in a strong position to commercially benefit from further AI innovations that OpenAI may develop."", ""Second, Microsoft's size and scale mean it can quickly deploy new generative AI features into its well-known and widely used software.

All totaled, the industry moved 241.8 million PCs, a 14.8% overall decline, and the first time that shipments have fallen below 250 million units since 2006, Gartner said.', '“The PC market has hit the bottom of its decline after significant adjustment,” Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa wrote in a release. “Inventory was normalized in the fourth quarter of 2023, which had been an issue plaguing the industry for two years. This subtle growth suggests that demand and supply are finally balanced.”', 'But Kitagawa warned that balance might be short-lived as economic and geopolitical volatility could upend the PC market’s return to growth. While the PC market picked up in Q4, the global market is still fraught with pockets of weakness. In particular China has proven to be stubbornly slow to recover.', 'Overall, Gartner said Greater China pulled down results for the Asia Pacific region, which saw shipments decline as much as 8%. The EMEA region saw the biggest jump in growth, with shipments rising 8.7%. North America shipments also increased.', 'The turnaround, however slight, comes at an important time for the PC industry, as Microsoft, chipmakers, and PC manufacturers push the concept of the AI PC as the next major growth opportunity for laptop and desktop PCs.', 'AI PCs are loosely defined as PCs outfitted with some kind of neural processor capable of running AI programs natively.

As the world began to shut down, millions set out to purchase PCs to be able to work and play while on lockdown.', 'As a result, sales of PCs fell off of a cliff as consumers and businesses had little reason to upgrade in the intervening years. But as those systems begin to become outdated, demand is picking up again.', 'That will help a litany of companies outside of PC makers, including chip manufacturers, memory makers, and other component builders.

But even after the cut, Walgreens yields 4%. And investors might be eyeing the stock as a potential turnaround play now that management has lowered one of its higher expenses and freed up cash to improve the business.', ""However, weak fundamentals and declining earnings make Walgreens too risky for the potential reward. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are five better Dow dividend stocks to buy now."", ""Apple yields just 0.5%, but that's a result of its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to its dividend."", 'Management has raised its dividend every year since 2012. And over the past 10 years, its dividend has more than doubled while its outstanding share count has fallen 37.7% thanks to buybacks.', ""Apple's cash-cow business model allows it to make dividend raises and buy back stock even during a slowdown, which we've seen play out over the last couple of years."", ""It's a good dividend stock for investors who value a quality business, buybacks, and dividend raises more than a high yield."", 'Like Apple, P&G is not purely a dividend play. It also has a sizable buyback program. And the business is as solid as ever.', 'The stock underperformed the market big time in 2023. Patient investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy a quality business at a good valuation.', 'P&G is one of the best-run businesses out there and arguably the single strongest business in the entire consumer staples sector. It has impeccable pricing power and industry-leading products across a wide variety of categories, including beauty; grooming; healthcare; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care.', ""Management has a track record of developing brands. The company's performance in fiscal 2023 proved that brands really do matter, even for everyday household products like laundry detergent, paper towels, razors, and more."", 'P&G operates a high-margin business, with recession resilience and a diversified business model. The only question investors should ask before buying the stock is whether it is expensive. At a 23.9 price-to-earnings ratio, it is trading around the same multiple as the S&P 500 -- which is reasonable for such a high-quality business even though it is growing slowly.', 'Like P&G, Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. It is one of the most reliable healthcare income stocks out there.', 'But the J&J of today is different than the J&J of the past, mainly because it spun off its consumer-healthcare products into a new company called Kenvue. The idea is that the ""new"" J&J will grow faster, with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.', 'Dividend Kings are known for their reliability, not for chasing growth. But J&J should have no trouble raising its dividend even with a more growth-orientated business. The company is a cash cow, generating far more free cash flow every year than it uses to pay the dividend.', ""J&J also has one of the strongest balance sheets, with total net long-term debt of a mere $6.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for a company with a market cap of $388 billion."", 'With a 3% dividend yield, a reliable business model, and a phenomenal balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend stock that investors can count on in 2024 and beyond.', 'Walmart is another example where the quality of the business, not the yield, is the primary focus. Its shares yield just 1.5% -- which is far less appealing than a stock like J&J.', 'But Walmart is also a Dividend King. It tends to make small dividend raises, choosing instead to reinvest and grow the business.', ""Perhaps Walmart's greatest quality is its ability to perform in a challenging environment. The business is all about undercutting the competition with the lowest prices and providing the best value for its customers. When the economy is faltering, or there's a changing business climate, it is a safe haven with the sophisticated supply chain needed to take market share."", 'Recent conditions provide a good stress test:', ""The company's results have been excellent, even as consumers have shifted from discretionary categories to staples. Walmart doesn't have nearly the same exposure to discretionary categories as its competitors, like Target. Years of long-term investments and expansions, paired with precise execution throughout this challenging time, have helped Walmart put up solid results, given the circumstances."", 'Walmart is the perfect stock for investors looking for a company that is less dependent on a strong economy to do well.', 'Coming in with a 4% dividend yield and nonstop annual payout raises since 1990, Chevron is an underrated dividend stock. It might not generate the consistent cash flow that Walmart, J&J, or P&G do. But it has an incredibly strong balance sheet and can fund the dividend and its operations even when oil is $50 a barrel.', 'Chevron is also geographically diversified and includes much more than just the upstream side of the industry. It has a sizable downstream business and is investing in low-carbon efforts.', ""It can do incredibly well and generate outsize profits when oil is a relatively high or even mediocre price like today's $78 Brent crude per-barrel price. That upside potential, paired with a large margin for error, makes Chevron a reliable income stock in a volatile sector."", 'Apple, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, and Chevron are five completely different companies in five different industries. But all five Dow stocks are components for a reason.', 'Each company should be able to fund dividend raises by growing its business. It sounds simple, but often we see powerful companies gradually lose their edge to competition. Or in the case of Walgreens, it lost market share and sustained ill-fated dividend raises for far too long.', ""All 30 Dow components are meant to represent their respective sector as a role model. Apple, P&G, J&J, Walmart, and Chevron do that well, which can't be said for every Dow stock. All five stocks are worth buying in January for investors looking for quality businesses they can count on, no matter what the new year brings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool Analyst Bill Barker. Bill, good to see you. Happy New Year."", 'Bill Barker: Happy New Year. Thanks for having me.', ""Deidre Woollard: I love to talk earnings. It's been a minute since I got to. I feel like we're currently in the calm before the storm in a few weeks but we do have some to talk about. Exciting to me at least, I want to start with the one I'm watching closely. I'm a shareholder of Walgreens Boots Alliance more formally; we just call it Walgreens. But I'm interested in this one for two reasons. You've got this new CEO, Tim Wentworth. He's got a healthcare background. He replaces a CEO, I really was excited about Ross Brewer. She was there, I think less than two years. That didn't really work out and you've also got this company that's in this pharmacy to healthcare shift. Bill, new CEO, how long before I start to get judging Tim Wentworth's performance?"", ""Bill Barker: Oh, I don't know. Have you listened to him? Have you listened to the conference calls? You can judge him right away if you want."", 'Deidre Woollard: I did listen. Yes.', 'Bill Barker: What do you think?', ""Deidre Woollard: I feel like he's very aware of the problems the company is facing, and I feel like he has a plan. I always I'd like someone who feels like they know what the plan is even when a company is not in the best space at this point."", ""Bill Barker: You know what the plan is and he's explained it and so you understand what you think they're up to. At the point at which he is offering timelines or directions that don't appear, then you can judge him poorly. At the moment, he came in early mid October. This is the first report since he came in. You expect something a little bit like this, a big bath report where you throw in a bunch of charges and you waive all that in the past, one time stuff going forward, I'll be judged from the point at which I have cleaned up the mess. This was part of defining some of the financial position of the company as a mess that is being put into the back, put into the past that includes the dividend cut."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, let's talk about that because that's part of the Big Bath approach is. You get all the hard stuff out of the way, you ascribe it to the past situation and you move forward. But 48% reduction in the dividend payout to 25%. Obviously, the market doesn't love this. It makes sense. You've got operating losses here, it's going to give you cash. But if you're someone who's holding this stock for the dividend, you're not happy. Larger institutions probably not happy about this as well. What are some of the repercussions besides it going down in the market today?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, of course, the market had anticipated with the stock price even before today that there was going to be a dividend cut. That is that the yield was 7% to 8% somewhere in there. That just doesn't happen particularly with a company that is not in a position to keep that up given the amount of cash on hand and the debt that Walgreens Boots Alliance has. I don't think this was entirely unexpected. Maybe the degree of taking it down basically by half, that may have been a bit more of a surprise than the fact that a cut was made at all. The market just was not pricing in an anticipation that this dividend could be maintained, or else it just wouldn't have been at a yield of 8%."", ""Deidre Woollard: But in general, when you have a dividend cut it, you can either see it two ways. You can see it as a sign that the company is really in trouble, or you can see that it's a sign that the company is being prudent and taking action. I think it's more being prudent in taking action here. How do you view it?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, I view it as evidence of some restriction on their capital allocation choices. They can't allocate capital the way they had given the number of acquisitions that they had made and the dividend where it was, and hoping to maintain that especially with a large chunk of the company's debt maturing in the next couple of years. They're going to have to issue a new debt. They have cash on hand to fund operations, but they're going to need to have some debt at higher levels given today's interest rates than when they issued the debt. The capital allocation choices are not extensive at the moment. They need to fix their balance sheet, and this is a prudent step in terms of doing so."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that's a really good point with that. But that debt you want to try to pay off as much of that as you can before you have to move on to that higher interest rate. Part of that is those acquisitions that you mentioned. It feels to me like they're done with the acquisition part of the healthcare pivot with that part of things, and maybe they're at the integration part of this. I'm thinking about this not just in terms of Walgreens. This isn't everybody into the pool situation, CVS, a little bit of further ahead on this pivot, Kroger is looking at health. Walmart obviously, Amazon is trying to figure it out. Everyone's trying to figure it out, I feel like Walgreens needs it to work more than some of those others, although maybe not more than CVS. What do you think about this when you've got a bunch of companies trying to chase this one thing. Most of them doing it by acquiring other smaller companies and trying to patch together something."", ""Bill Barker: Well, there's a lot of competition here. You've got increased use of mail, people getting their drugs delivered by mail. You've got more and more players. As you mentioned, the Walmarts, Costco, everybody, Kroger, and Safeway. Everybody you can name can do a lot of what Walgreen's substantial business is. You've got pharmacists who are striking. You've got just competition from a lot of different places and the number 2 player, a huge operation. They're well known and trusted by millions, but the opportunities to increase their prices are very limited. I think given especially some of the attention that's being paid to the PBM's which is a remarkable amount of advertising and actually one of the few issues that you can find where there seems to be some bipartisan agreement that this is something worth addressing."", ""Deidre Woollard: One thing I think is interesting with Walgreens is the retail side wasn't so bad. They saw some good growth in pharmacy, but a lot of that was due to the cost of drugs. But you mentioned the pharmacists and this part, I think is really interesting because on the earnings call, Tim Wentworth, he talked a bit about how they're working with colleges. They're trying to build that pipeline of pharmacists. That's important because there aren't enough pharmacists out there. The pharmacists that are there are clearly not happy. You had what they called pharmageddon in October with pharmacists walking out. Part of that is OK. You get more pharmacists and that maybe takes some of the work load off but I also think we've seen workers feel more empowered lately and so with Walgreens, do they also have to make those existing pharmacists happier?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, apparently they do. You can't sustain too many strikes like that. People will just go elsewhere and when they're used to getting everything always at Walgreens, getting everything fulfilled there because Walgreens has already got my insurance information and I can just go there and they are forced to find other outlets to get their needed pharmaceuticals and prescriptions filled. That's bad for Walmart, for people, its loyal customers to be finding who else does exactly what Walgreens does for them, but maybe more reliably. Maybe at better prices for some people when they finally have to go out and check out the competition. Yeah, it's a really difficult spot for them to be and they need more pharmacists. The pharmacists they have have demonstrated that they're not happy. Walgreens is right now in the midst of trying to execute substantial savings operations in tune in terms of billions of dollars of annual savings on costs. That is a limiting factor on just throwing money at the problem."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah. It's interesting too. I think about this for the long term, thinking about the role of the pharmacist because you've got an aging pharmacist population currently, so you need to bring more pharmacists in. But at the same time, you maybe have some of the pharmacist role being automated or taken over by AI in some way. Who knows what's down the road? AI gets in to everything. But I think it's interesting that it's one of those areas where you have aging pharmacists and, you have an aging population so you're also going to have an increasing amount of prescriptions and you need to have that knowledge. It's a tough spot to be in."", ""Bill Barker: It's a tough spot for Walgreens. Fortunately, right now in terms of the stock in the company, it is trading at less than seven times adjusted earnings. They reemphasized or reiterated this year's adjusted earnings. The adjusted earnings are very different from the GAAP earnings at the moment when we mentioned maybe one time charges that were lumped into this quarter. But if you can deliver at the high end of the range, $3.50 a share and let's emphasize adjusted earnings for a stock that's trading at less than seven times that amount. Look, if they deliver that this year, the stock's going to go higher from here. It's not going to hang around at less than seven times earnings once you convince people that those earnings are repeatable and that you start eliminating the adjustment out of the equation."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm going to take us in another topic. We're going to talk about eggs. One of the things I find fascinating is that there's this one company that really is a friend of ours called Big Egg or Big Yolk. It's Cal-Maine. This is interesting because this time, last year, especially around the holidays, everybody was freaking out around the price of eggs and inflation in general and inflation has dropped. Some prices have not dropped with it, unfortunately but egg prices have dropped a lot so good news for us. Bad news for Cal-Maine, because they're the biggest producer of shell eggs. According to the company, at the end of last year, they were getting $2.88 for a dozen conventional eggs. End of last year, $1.45 so huge drop. Yet this company, I mean this is an interesting one, it's performed well over the past five years. Not so great over the past year because egg prices. How do you think about businesses that are so dependent on really a single product like this?"", ""Bill Barker: Well, I would certainly start by saying, I have no ability to tell you what is going to happen with egg prices from year to year, or a decade to decade. They'll probably go up over the course of a decade, but there are things that happen that dramatically affect, it's a commodity. There's no brand value to eggs. The things that happen like avian flu outbreak, which is happening again, and which took egg production for Cal-Maine virtually took it down by a half from fiscal year of '16-'17, that could happen again, that would drive up egg prices, but that's not a good thing, that's how it occurs. If Cal-Maine can do a better job of protecting its eggs and livestock than the competition so that it has much less exposure to something that affects the market as a whole then that would be advantageous to it. But they're not looking for avian flu to in any way improve what happens for shareholders. That's just not going to happen. I think you're exposed. You're exposed when you are a company that has one product and it's a very fragmented market and they can continue to acquire some of the competition as they've been doing relentlessly over the last 30 years. But the nice part about this one products is it's something that people have always wanted and we assume we'll always want."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that's true. They've done some smaller acquisitions. I know they're buying an old Tyson broiler factory. They're going to convert that to egg production. You mentioned the branding. There's egg brands but there's no main egg brand but there are types. They've got Cal-Maine, they have conventional eggs, but they've also got specialty eggs so that's things like organic, cage free, smaller part of the business, but they're able to control the prices. Bill, are you the regular egg buyer or are you looking for the cage free or farm raised? What's your egg?"", ""Bill Barker: I am an infrequent buyer of eggs. There are other things that I'm more competent at buying. But I think I've been known when asked, I'm going to the store, what do we need, and eggs is thrown out that I'll get them, but I have no idea what brand I might want to look for. But I typically would pick up the organic or cage free, or both so because that seems to be what we have in the house."", ""Deidre Woollard: It's not price dependent for you?"", 'Bill Barker: No. I am pleased to hear today that egg prices have been cut in half over the last year. I would not have been somebody who would have been able to tell you that from my purchasing experience. There are other products, the prices of which I follow closer than that in the grocery store.', ""Deidre Woollard: I'm going to get you buy more eggs. Thanks for your time today, Bill."", 'Bill Barker: Thank you.', ""Deidre Woollard: Growth stocks steal the spotlight in the financial media. But something way more boring is behind a whole lot of wealth creation, dividends, the regular payments that companies send shareholders. Dividends can make a company a little more disciplined on capital allocation and provide investors with long term streams of income.

The market was on fire last year, but one luxury retailer didn't join the party. Ricky Mulvey caught up with Motley Fool candidate Jim Gillies to talk about a couple of pullback stocks and setting expectations for investments in 2024."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Jim, we have been tasked with discussing some pullback stocks and I feel like this is the harder job to start the year with the segment. This would have been much easier if we were recording this just a few months ago and I'm a long term investor, I want to let my winners run and I'm feeling a little wary right now. Tech stocks rose about 50% in 2023. They feel like we're at zero interest rates again and how can investors set their expectations during what some may feel is a little bit of a market mania?"", ""Jim Gillies: Sure. Well, yes, obviously it would have been very nice to have done this show say around the end of October, early November before the markets just decided, hey party on guys, let's go and ran up. I'm going to push back a little bit. I don't know that I would consider us to be in a market mania phase. I don't feel terribly bad that yes, tech stocks are up in the last year, largely due to the so called now magnificent seven that are at the front of the S&P 500 and of the Nasdaq. That of course being Meta and Microsoft, and Nvidia, and Apple, Amazon and there's two more in there. I think for starters, at the start of the year we've gone on valuation and second of all, I don't know that I would agree that we're back to zero interest rate levels. I'm a Canadian and so our tech sector basically consist of two companies Shopify and Constellation Software. I will point out Shopify today, it's up 120% in 2023. That's fantastic and great. Still about 55% below, it's all time high, which tells you, I think a little bit about how crazy things got during the tail end of COVID running up to say November 2021, maybe early 2022 and how much things fell such that you can get 120% gain in a year, which by all accounts is a pretty good year. You still need to more than double to get back to where you were at one point."", ""I think a lot of maybe a little bit of recency bias where we look at what's happened in the last three or six months and go, boy, things have gotten really expensive and what I like to do when I'm feeling this way and it's something when I talk to other young analyst in a mentor role or when I'm trying to annoy a coworker of mine who might like a stock that I loathe or vice versa. I like to say there's two questions that matter in investing. There's two questions. The first question is, what is it whatever the stock is, what is it worth and why? I feel that if you can answer those questions in any market environment, euphoric, despondent, flat, I think you're probably pretty good ground there because you're going to be wrong obviously because we don't have perfect foresight. But it helps a framework to start deciding, well what is it worth? What is a Constellation Software worth? Why is it worth that? What is a Facebook/Meta worth? Why is it worth that? Meta's up, what? I think it came into the year sub 100 bucks and now it's over 300?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: That's pretty good."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, it's pretty good, but I actually bought and sold, I still call it Facebook. I actually bought and sold Facebook in early 2023 for a fairly quick double. I don't particularly like the stock, but I looked at it and answered those questions, what is it worth and why and said, well, it's worth considerably more than where it hits trading here at what, 80 or 90 bucks kind of thing."", 'Ricky Mulvey: It was basically, and I know the PE multiple has faults. At one point, Facebook was trading less than the regular S&P 500 multiple. It feels like if you own that much of the internet and you have three billion people interacting with your platform, like those network of effects got to be worth a little bit more than the average.', ""Jim Gillies: Yes. You've just gone a long ways to answering the second question, the why."", ""Ricky Mulvey: One of the things if you're going to take advantage of stocks in a pullback is you got to have some dry powder to do so. How are you thinking about as we start the New Year, how are you thinking about your cash position? How should investors think about their cash position right now?"", ""Jim Gillies: My cash position was fairly large coming into Autumn 2023 for various reasons. Most of it I actually deployed between September and November, so I'm a little light on cash at the moment, but I think given what's happened in November, December, that turned out to be fairly prudent. But then the trick becomes, unless you were going to sell something to buy something else, which means you have to get two decisions, you have to get the selling correct and the new purchase correct. I prefer to replenish my cash position, and so I'm in the privileged position of I'm still gainfully employed, at least Knock-wood until the end of the year and so every paycheck, every paycheck, X percent goes into the investment account, X percent of my significant other's paycheck goes into the investment account, and so you're continually adding cash for future now obviously as your portfolio ideally gets larger, those incremental cash ads become less and less important. But also, I think that, I know this is going to air in the new year, but I'm a big fan of tax loss harvesting and again, you're going through that little mini framework of mind, what's it worth and why. In this case it makes you forced to look at this stock in certain name here, whatever. This stock is down 50, 60% this year. Why is it down so much? What's happened? You start answering those questions, like maybe management biffed an acquisition, maybe you simply paid too much when you bought it and the prospects growth has fallen off at the company so the prospects might not be great for a recovery. But these types of things allow you to say I'm going to harvest for tax loss purposes, or I'm going to harvest some losers to redeploy in the New Year into winners. Maybe if you have I want to avoid wash sale rule things, maybe you still like the company, you sell it now, you buy it back in the new year after what is it usually 30 days. I think for wash sale rules."", ""Ricky Mulvey: We're doing December advice in January, Jim."", ""Jim Gillies: Well, it's funny thing, Ricky. December comes every year and I think you can very comfortably start planning for December 2024 and also nothing says you can't take a tax loss in let's say June."", ""Ricky Mulvey: When we talked about what's it worth? You got to know a little bit of the multiples to tell the story. One industry you pay attention to is retail. I'll say the physical retail space and there's one ETF covering it, called XRT. Still off about 30% from COVID highs. Since this is one of your playgrounds, how are you looking for opportunities in this space? Are there one or two valuation metrics that newer investors coming into this show can use to compare those physical retailers?"", ""Jim Gillies: Unfortunately, they're not easy metrics to find. Anyone can look up same store sales or comp sales or whatever we're doing. The metrics of everyone can look up on earnings multiple may or may not be terribly useful frankly. My preferred thing is to say if I want to look at something in the retail space, although that could apply to pretty much anything, as I would encourage new investors to take an extra step. I want them to take an extra step because the more extra steps you take and you understand why you invest in the things you do, and you understand how to maybe look at a company that gets you more involved, it makes you more sticky. I think it makes you a more long term investor because you are starting to build. The dirty little secret, right? We recommend stocks for a living, but we certainly don't know everything about a company on the Day 1 where we recommend it. We're building relationships. I know and I learn more about a stock I've invested in a year, two years, three years down the road. But one of the things that I'm a real big fan of cash flow as you know, and so for a newer investor I would say, acquaint yourself with a company's financial reports. Look up the annual report. You don't need to look at quarterlies yet. But go find the most recent annual report. They'll be on the company's website under the investor relations section. There are three main financial statements and they're all important in their own way. But ignore the income statement for now, ignore the balance sheet for now, just go to the cash flow statement and look up two lines."", ""The first line is cash flow from operations or from operating activities, quite often said and the second line is down in the section on investing cash flows. It'll say capital expenditures or purchase of PP&E, property plan equipment, that thing. Simply take operating cash flow and subtract what the company spent on capex. That gives you a rough idea of what the company produced in terms of cash flow. Cash flow that they don't need to finance and roll into and finance their own activities. It's cash flow that in theory they could just turn around and hand all of it to their shareholders. In theory it's called free cash flow. Do that and then compare that to the price, the value of the company, the entire market cap of the company, which is the share price multiplied by the number of shares. You can even maybe bring in, if the company employs debt or whatever, you can even bring in debt and say add that in, but you want to pay a reasonable price for whatever you're getting. The next thing though is understand a little bit of the business you're buying. Just for fun, we'll throw out here, GameStop. The famous meme stock that got everyone in a tizzy a couple of years ago. Sells video games, collectibles, video game systems, what have you. Not a lot of growth there, so you'd like to see [inaudible]. You'd like to see them producing more cash because that is an industry that's on the decline, going away. There's always the fear that physical media will just disappear and everything will be streaming so you'll get your games the same way you get your Netflix."", ""If you did want to buy GameStop, and I'm not a fan of GameStop at this price, but if you did want to buy GameStop, you would start gauging and say, well, if I could pay less than 10 times cash flow for this and I'm reasonably sure the cash flow is decent, maybe that's in this type of a company, maybe it's good. But since we are trying to talk a little bit about rebounds or maybe buying opportunities on pullbacks, there is a Canadian retailer that I've got my eye on and that I have recommended in the service that I front. It's a company called Aritzia. I am not a fashion plate of course, but other people are and it's been very successful in Canada until really the last year. It was really successful the ticker is ATZ on the Toronto Stock Exchange and there is a pink sheet listing, which I don't have off the top of my head, but it's a couple billion dollar company, I believe. Basically, they're maxed out in Canada in terms of their growth here. But they're not trying to grow in Canada they are coming south. We are invading the United States. Aritzia has been very deliberately coming into the states following a strategy because they are very popular here and a concept that works here generally could work there. An example I would give you Canadian company where it maxed out in the country and worked very well here and has also worked very well down there. You've heard of Lululemon?"", 'Ricky Mulvey: Heard of it. I own the stock as well.', ""Jim Gillies: Beautiful. That is a great example of what I'm looking at with Aritzia here. Because you might remember about a decade ago, Lululemon, currently about $500 a share, was $135 a share stock because they'd gotten beaten down. They had some executive turmoil, they had a bit of a scandal. Some of their very popular leggings were denoted as see through, not generally good, and so the stock got beaten down as a result. That's where Aritzia is right now, because they turfed on some of their fashion. They turfed on some of their growth plans. The stock is down 40% this year, but they are spending significant cash. We look at our cash flow and they're spending a little bit more cash than they're making right now. But the reason for that is for this broad push into the US. If it works similar to what Lululemon did, they're able to correct their problems. They're able to continue their growth trajectory, this could be really interesting for investors in say 5-7 years."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Jim, I think you just answered the last three questions I had in the outline with that one. No, one of these days we're going to have Gillies' rants unleashed on the show and I can't wait for that day. [laughs] Jim, as always, appreciate your time and your insight."", 'Jim Gillies: Thank you, Ricky. You take care.', ""Deidre Woollard: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The term ""buy and hold"" suggests buying and forgetting, which is rarely a good idea. Holding ""forever,"" meanwhile, may be overly ambitious. Many of us will need or want to sell after a decade or two -- for retirement income, possibly.', 'Still, here are three companies worth considering for your long-term, buy-to-hold portfolio.', 'Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: TTWO), with a recent market value near $27 billion, is a major player in a growing industry -- video games. The folks at Grand View Research estimated the global video game market at around $217 billion in 2022, growing by more than 13% annually through 2030.

That's because it made a massive $13 billion acquisition of Zynga in 2022 -- a company with hits such as Farmville, Words with Friends, CSR 2, and Zynga Poker that's helping Take-Two grow its mobile offerings. That big buy, along with other issues such as delays and cancellations, has the company with significant debt and posting losses instead of gains."", ""But there's reason to be optimistic: There are high expectations for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI, which arrives in 2025.

Each had a gross capacity of about 350 MW. Unit 3, with a capacity of about 800 MW gross, was added in 2010. Xcel Energy operates the facility, which has been the largest power plant in Colorado and was recognized as the Powder River Basin Coal Users’ Group (PRBCUG) Plant of the Year in 2018. However, Unit 1 was retired in 2022, Unit 2 will be shuttered in 2025, and Unit 3 is slated for closure in 2031. [caption id=""attachment_122697"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""720""]', '1. Comanche Generating Station in Pueblo, Colorado. Courtesy: Xcel Energy[/caption] The PIESAC cited testimony by Dr. Mike Wakefield, director of the Healy Center at Colorado State University, Pueblo, who reportedly suggested Comanche 3 is one of the most economically impactful industries in the Pueblo community with a total annual impact of more than $196 million a year. In the report, one of the PIESAC members said, “Pueblo is a poor community, and the closure of Comanche 3 puts us further behind.” Xcel Energy was noted to be one of the largest taxpayers in Pueblo, paying more than $25 million a year to Pueblo County, most of which is reportedly from the Comanche Station with more than $15 million of the total coming from Comanche 3. In addition, Holy Cross Electric and CORE (the other co-owners of Comanche 3) reportedly pay almost $5.9 million a year in taxes to Pueblo County. After reviewing and studying possible new clean energy technologies that could be available by 2034, the PIESAC recommended that Xcel Energy consider constructing “advanced nuclear including small nuclear modules and or a new combined cycle gas plant with carbon capture” in Pueblo. However, the committee said a new gas plant with carbon capture would not “make Pueblo whole.” The report says, “Of all of the technologies that we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”', 'A poll of 500 individuals from Pueblo was conducted by The Keating Group during the period Nov. 9–14, 2023. The PIESAC report says, “It is clear that the community understands the importance of Comanche 3 to the economic wellbeing of Pueblo.” The Keating Group reportedly found 64% of respondents were “concerned” about the closure of Comanche 3, with a majority of those respondents “very concerned.” Most feared the job losses, but tax losses and economic impacts on the community were also high on the list. The gas plant with carbon capture received the most support as a replacement technology (74%), but advanced nuclear was not far behind, with about two-thirds of respondents supporting it. The poll also found high support for additional solar, but the PIESAC was less excited about that option because solar produces very few jobs—five to 10—and lower salaries ($40,000 to $80,000). The report says tax payments from solar would only amount to about $1.69 million per year. “Further, Pueblo may have reached the saturation point for solar installations,” it says.', 'The PIESAC was created to evaluate and recommend future clean energy generation strategies that decision-makers felt could help direct the replacement of the existing coal units at Comanche Generation Station. The committee was formed from a diverse group of Pueblo community leaders. PIESAC’s first meeting was held in February 2023. It has met monthly and sometimes twice a month, with meetings lasting approximately three hours. The group has been advised by several independent third parties, including 1898 & Co., which is a national consulting group established by Burns and McDonnell; Tetra Tech; LEEDS School of Business at Colorado University, Boulder; and The Keating Group. Many Xcel Energy leaders have also provided oral presentations and written information to the group. As part of the evaluation process, PIESAC toured the Comanche plant, as well as a site known as PuebloPlex—a large undeveloped area with roads and rail, which is also a possible site for replacement power generation. PuebloPlex was noted in the report to have “huge potential for energy-related companies.” The group also heard from various community organizations, including the library association and local school districts, which all have receive funds from Comanche’s taxes.', 'In addition to combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) and advanced nuclear technology (Figure 2), the PIESAC also evaluated several other energy options based on providing 500 MW of electricity, which is about what Xcel Energy owns of the Comanche 3 unit. The results were “starkly different,” according to the report. [caption id=""attachment_197847"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""720""]', ""2. A small modular reactor (SMR) unit, such as GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300, could be a suitable replacement technology for Comanche 3. Courtesy: GEH[/caption] Solar, lithium-ion battery, high-temp battery, flow battery, and kinetic energy were all estimated to require less than 10 long-term employees, and contribute less than $1.75 million in property taxes. Long-duration storage, thermal energy storage, liquid air energy storage, hydrogen primary fuel, and compressed air energy storage all fell in the five to 40 worker range, but each also contributed less than $1.75 million in property taxes. While CCGT with carbon capture was estimated to only require about 20 to 25 workers, it did provide much higher property tax revenue ($16.52 million) than the solar or storage options. Still, the clear winner, as previously mentioned, was advanced nuclear. It was expected to put about 200 to 300 long-term staff on the payroll, and provide $95.29 million in property taxes. “After all of the presentations and analysis that we have done over the last ten months, we have each become convinced that the only technologies that have the potential to create good long-term family-supporting jobs and millions of dollars of property tax payments are advanced nuclear with a new gas and carbon capture running a distant second,” the report says. —Aaron Larson is POWER’s executive editor (@POWERmagazine).""]"

What are you a bit optimistic about heading into these reports?"", ""CHRISTINE SHORT: So despite the lay of the land that you just gave, yes, companies guidance has been lowered or analysts have been lowering-- sell-side analysts have been lowering their guidance.

Well, academic research shows if companies push their earnings out, it tends to correlate highly with bad news being shared on the call, right? If you have bad news to share, you kind of want to push it, right?', ""And so that index is at the lowest we've seen it since we started tracking in 2015.

What are you expecting that tone to be from them as they kick off?"", ""CHRISTINE SHORT: Yeah, so as you know, the banks kick it off. They're really the bellwether for the rest of the season. They set the tone. And you just mentioned Jamie Dimon. He had some pretty concerning comments last--"", ""I think he used the word, we're in the most dangerous period and we're setting up for a range of outcomes. We're hoping for the best. Things like that don't set the tone very well. Jane Fraser at Citigroup, same thing, talked about CEO optimism and sentiment being quite low in her opinion."", ""And so investors are really looking to those bank CEOs and that commentary this season to confirm that we are-- the US economy is resilient. We are indeed heading for a soft landing. So we're hoping for softer comments, more positive and optimistic comments, and there's a handful of metrics that we're really going to be looking at."", ""Provisions for profit-- loan loss provisions, which have been built up in the past.

As Netflix\'s lowest-cost subscription is $6.99 per month, the gaming service could appeal to consumers who are often seeking a variety of titles to rotate through during the year.', ""Due to the timing of GTA: San Andreas' release, Storyteller was also the most downloaded game for December 2023, beating GTA: San Andreas by around 500,000 installs, notes Appfigures."", 'Many of Netflix\'s games are tied to its streaming titles -- like ""Stranger Things,"" which had its own subset of games and featured in Netflix\'s version of the popular party game ""Heads Up!""

It also saw the tower defense title Bloons TD 6 as a top download as of last fall. However, the firm cautioned that the recent jump in downloads had come after ""months of stagnation,"" which suggests that Netflix may need regular releases and ongoing promotion to keep its game engine pumping.', 'Last year, it worked toward that goal with the release of 40 games, including popular titles like ""Monument Valley"" and two internally developed games, ""Oxenfree II: Lost Signals"" and ""Netflix Stories: Love Is Blind."" It also began testing game play on TVs in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, and personalized gaming suggestions within its app.', ""But daily game downloads following the GTA releases have been tapering off.

Drugmakers are testing these drugs for other health benefits such as lowering cardiovascular disease risk and obstructive sleep apnea.', 'Amgen has an experimental dual mechanism obesity drug in mid-stage trials it hopes will have fewer side effects with less frequent dosing than Wegovy or Zepbound, Chief Scientific Officer Jay Bradner told Reuters at the annual JPMorgan health conference in San Francisco this week.', 'Wegovy and Zepbound belong to a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists developed for type 2 diabetes that reduce food cravings and cause the stomach to empty more slowly.', ""Bradner said if that differentiation from the market leaders is demonstrated, it would give Amgen a footing in the obesity market despite Novo and Lilly's head start."", '""It\'s really not too late to be entering the obesity market. There remains massive unmet need, and the public health need is not fully addressed by the medicines that have already been approved,"" he said. Nearly 115 million U.S. adults and children are obese.', 'German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim is developing an obesity treatment with Danish biotech Zealand Pharma that targets GLP-1 as well as another hormone called glucagon.', '""I think we may be the first to bring a GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist (to market),"" said Boehringer\'s head of discovery research Clive Wood.', 'By targeting glucagon, the drug also increases energy expended.', '""While you\'re suppressing appetite, you\'re burning more calories,"" Wood said. Merck and small biotech Altimmune have similar drugs in development.', 'Bayer pharmaceuticals head Stefan Oelrich in an interview at the conference said the company was reluctant to venture into the obesity market on its own, but may look to partner with companies with the right expertise.', 'Pfizer will focus on drugs already in its pipeline and look for licensing deals or to acquire less expensive earlier stage obesity assets, CEO Albert Bourla told reporters at JPMorgan.', '""Pfizer\'s position is that we believe obesity is a place that we have the ability to play and win. So we will have to play,"" he said.', '$150 BILLION MARKET?', ""Bourla also said some estimates for the eventual size of the obesity market had grown to $150 billion a year, up 50% from industry executives' and analysts' most optimistic predictions less than a year ago."", 'In 2023, U.S. demand outstripped supply for the Novo and Lilly weight-loss drugs. Lilly CEO David Ricks said its supply of Zepbound may not be enough to meet demand this year either. Novo Nordisk in August said constraints on Wegovy supplies would most likely extend into 2024.', 'While the market is going to be big enough to support several players, ClearBridge Investments analyst Marshall Gordon said entering now would be a challenge because Lilly and Novo have other new obesity drugs far along in late-stage trials in addition to their blockbuster medicines.', 'ClearBridge owns shares in both companies, according to LSEG data.', '""It\'s going to take more than just a ‘me-too’ here.

I think this is such a huge addressable market that there\'ll be space for different types of products, different administrations, and probably also different efficacy levels,"" Jørgensen said.', ""Jørgensen said this previously undisclosed information will be discussed in more detail at the company's investor day in March."", ""GLP-1s are the dominant treatment for the new obesity market, led by Novo's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) newly approved Zepbound. Investors are waiting to see how the companies compete with each other, and others, for market share."", ""GLP-1s are named for the hormone they mimic in the body that helps to help slow digestion and increase insulin production. They rose to popularity last year — fueled by celebrity interest in the record levels of weight loss achieved by the diabetes drugs Ozempic, from Novo, and Mounjaro, from Lilly. Both products have the same key ingredient as their counterpart obesity drug, semaglutide in Novo's drugs and tirzepatide in Lilly's."", ""But there are other formulations being worked on by other companies — all rushing in to get a piece of what is projected to be a $100 billion or more market by the end of the decade that will touch, potentially, half of the world's population."", 'The strategies vary from finding an oral option to searching for different disease that could benefit from the treatment. Novo already created a stir around the possibilities with a study late last year that showed Wegovy could help reduce the risk of serious heart problems.', 'Pfizer (PFE) has launched an oral GLP-1 program. Roche (RHHBY) re-entered the market after a decade by acquiring obesity drug developer Carmot. Amgen (AMGN) is working on an oral option as well as an injectable, which are part of the broader GLP-1 space.', 'Amgen CEO Robert Bradway said the company has ""about a half dozen or so other medicines in a preclinical state that we\'re excited about in the obesity area.”', 'Merck (MRK), meanwhile, is testing a GLP-1 for potential liver benefits.', 'Roche Pharmaceuticals CEO Teresa Graham told Yahoo Finance the pipeline the company gained from Carmot offers potential beyond the obesity market.', '""In the next couple of years we expect something like 4 billion people around the world to be obese ... I think clearly there\'s going to be opportunity for multiple players to be in this space,"" Graham said.', 'Others, like AstraZeneca (AZN), are pursuing a ""cocktail"" approach. AstraZeneca is pairing a GLP-1 it is licensing from China\'s Eccogene with its blockbuster Farxiga, a diabetes drug that also has benefits for heart failure and kidney disease.', 'Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told reporters that the market is currently a duopoly, but there will be ""fierce competition as everybody in existence is going after this market.""', 'Bourla sees obesity as a place where his company can play and win with its current pipeline, but is also looking for early-stage assets for acquisition and for licensing.', '""I don\'t expect we are going and buying a Phase 3 asset on obesity that will be at the multibillion dollars [level],"" Bourla said, noting the company needs to reduce debt after its $43 billion Seagen acquisition to boost its oncology pipeline.', 'Still, Pfizer sees opportunity in the oral space, which is predicted to be one-third of the projected $100 billion-plus market by the end of the decade. Bourla added that Pfizer could capture one-third of the oral market.', 'Not all large cap players are joining in. Gilead (GILD) and Sanofi (SNY), for example, are staying away. Sanofi has a GLP-1 diabetes drug, Lyxumia, which was approved in 2016, but it had joined other big pharma companies which abandoned the obesity market back in 2008.', ""CEO Paul Hudson told reporters this week he isn't going to get back in, and isn't pursuing this first wave of interest."", '""You can\'t go back and close six, seven years of work that\'s been done on these studies and to try to catch up — even though there\'s a lot of appetite for it,"" Hudson said.', ""Lilly's CEO David Ricks said pursuing different methods and finding additional benefits will be the 2024 GLP-1 story for most companies."", '""Next year there\'s more pivotal readouts on serious disease. We\'ve got heart disease and sleep apnea coming. I\'m sure Novo has their own list. For the next few years, that\'s how this will go.

The spot price of the metal soared 13% last year, and there's speculation that it will continue to remain in demand in 2024 -- perhaps even setting a new high."", ""But what's the best route to add some glitter to your portfolio? Sure, visiting the local coin gallery and buying gold bullion is one option. However, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM) Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV), and Newmont (NYSE: NEM) are three gold stocks that provide even better opportunities for gold bugs in the new year."", ""Agnico Eagle is a gold-mining stock that outshines many of its peers with its mines in North America, Finland, and Australia. After its 2022 merger with Kirkland Lake Gold and its acquisition of Yamana's Canadian assets, Agnico has emerged as a leading producer of gold -- and profits. Compared to Barrick Gold and Gold Fields, two of its leading peers based on market cap, it distinguishes itself with strong free cash flow."", ""This helps provide the ability to acquire more assets or to advance growth projects that will expand its mineral resources and strengthen the company's future."", ""The strong free cash flow has also helped the company to remain in sound financial health -- something that's not always the case with mining companies, which require large amounts of capital to develop their assets. At the end of 2023's third quarter, Agnico had an investment-grade balance sheet and a conservative ratio of 0.36 in net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)."", 'Currently, investors can grab shares of Agnico Eagle from the bargain bin. The stock sells for about 11.2 times operating cash flow, a discount to its five-year average cash-flow multiple of 13.5.', 'Unlike mining companies that dig gold out of the ground, Franco-Nevada is a royalty and streaming company. More like specialized financiers, royalty and streaming companies provide up-front capital to miners to help them finance their capital-intensive projects. In return, they receive the right to acquire future mineral production for a set price (usually lower than the current market price) or to receive a portion of the mined minerals.', 'Because of this business model, Franco-Nevada provides gold investors with an investment opportunity that has less risk than the mining companies that must execute on the development of the assets.', ""While Franco-Nevada has exposure to other metals as well as oil and gas, its gold represents the lion's share of the company's revenue: 78% as of last year's third quarter. And the company has partnerships with some of the leading gold mining companies, including Barrick, Newmont, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross Gold."", ""Further evidence of Franco-Nevada's appeal for conservative investors comes from the stock's rock-solid balance sheet that features zero debt and $1.3 billion in cash."", ""Newmont, with a history stretching back over a century, is the largest gold-mining stock based on market capitalization, and it's the only gold producer included in the S&P 500."", 'The company appears a lot more attractive now since it closed on its acquisition of Newcrest in November. Newmont expects the transaction to immediately add value, projecting that it will achieve $500 million in pre-tax synergies in the two years following the closing of the deal as well as a minimum of $2 billion in cash improvements through portfolio optimization during the same period.', ""One of the especially alluring qualities of Newmont is its attention to rewarding shareholders. The company has a unique dividend policy among gold stocks in that it distributes a fixed dividend of $1 per share (at a gold price of at least $1,400 per ounce) and a variable dividend based on the company's free cash flow."", ""Currently, Newmont's stock offers a juicy 4% forward-yielding dividend. And those concerned about whether the company is jeopardizing its financial health to appease investors can rest assured thanks to the company's conservative approach to leverage. At the end of Q3 2023, Newmont had a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 0.7 -- below the company's targeted ratio of 1."", 'The most conservative investors yearning for gold exposure will find that Franco-Nevada is probably their best bet thanks to its debt-free balance sheet and a business model that represents a lower risk profile than other gold stocks.', 'For those comfortable with a higher degree of risk, however, Agnico Eagle and Newmont both offer great propositions -- especially Newmont, with its compelling dividend policy.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Newmont right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Newmont, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Newmont wasn't one of them.

125,2aba5444-6df8-3524-ab13-5fb98b4c85a0,ZTS,2024-01-11,Zoetis’s CEO says people are demanding human-quality health care for their pets—and it’s leading to new treatments,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-ceo-says-people-demanding-110000107.html,1704884400,STORY,['ZTS'],"['Like many pet-focused companies, Zoetis benefitted mightily from the boom in spending on furry dependents during the pandemic, fueled by the sheer number of animals Americans adopted. Now, the drug maker for animals is betting it can sustain past momentum as pet owners shift discretionary spending from items like deluxe collars and designer dog coats to fighting conditions that used to be hard to treat in animals, such as osteoarthritis.', '""They see their pet as their child, so they think their pet deserves the same health care they receive,"" Zoetis CEO Kristin Peck tells\xa0Fortune. Peck, CEO since 2020, right before the pandemic began, and the architect of Zoetis\'s\xa0spinout from Pfizer seven years earlier, believes pain management, diagnostics, and the use of antibodies in the development of treatments are key areas where research is yielding the next wave of medical products for animals.', 'Growth in spending on pets,\xa0which rose 51% to $136.8 billion between 2018 and 2022, is slowing in the post-pandemic return to normal, making the health care push crucial for many pet companies. Petco went as far as to rename itself Petco Health and Wellness in 2021, while\xa0Chewy plans to open its first vet clinics\xa0next year.', ""Zoetis, which also develops vaccines and treatments for livestock, is working on new diagnostics and telemedicine products for agricultural clients, too. The company's revenue was up 5% in the first nine months of 2023, and Wall Street expects it to hit roughly $8.5 billion for the full year. The company will report those results in February."", 'Peck, whose family owns two dogs, a cat, and a bird, says growing concerns about agriculture\'s impact on the climate, notably bovine burping and flatulence, is a testament to the need for Zoetis\'s products. ""It\'s our responsibility to show people that healthier animals are more sustainable animals,"" she says.', 'This article has been edited and condensed for clarity.', 'Fortune:\xa0Do you see a lot of runway even as spending returns to normalcy post-pandemic?', ""There's more room to grow. What's changed dramatically in the last few years has been who is adopting pets. The majority of pet owners today are millennials or Gen Z, and they see their pets more as members of the family than other generations and think their pet deserves the same health care they receive."", 'How is their expectation for better pet health care feeding research?', 'People are realizing treatments—like providing monoclonal antibodies for dermatology or osteoarthritis pain, just like you can for humans—are available for pets, and they want access to them. We have found a way to bring some of the human standards of care to your pet. But we have to make it at a price point someone is willing and able to pay.', 'Insurance for pet owners is growing but still only accounts for 3% of what people spend on their companion animals. Could it become mainstream and change your business?', ""There is reason to believe it could be much bigger in the U.S. when you look at Europe, where it's more mainstream. We've invested in trying to help grow that market and believe it's important. In human medicine, you always recommend the best care and the insurance company will decide. A vet will not always recommend the best care because they're worried about whether the patient can pay."", 'Livestock medicine has historically been the largest piece of your business. Could the push to fight climate change lead people to rethink beef consumption?', ""It's our responsibility to show people that healthier animals are more sustainable animals. A healthier animal uses less water, feed, and land and is more productive. We are going to add a billion people by 2050, and even if people pivot between proteins, we'll need to produce 70% more protein, but with less land than we currently have. We have to find ways to raise animals more sustainably."", 'Still, cow flatulence and burping are big causes of methane gas. Are you working on products like the Gas X for cows?', ""There are things you can do, but because of cows' biology—their stomachs have four chambers—and how they digest, you have to be careful. There are different supplements and ways to help, and we are working in that space."", 'What are the top areas of innovation in animal health care?', ""I think we will use monoclonal antibodies in vaccines for way more than we are today and use genetics to better predict disease in pets and livestock. Another area is diagnostics. We are using AI to get faster results to help the animal in question and give a virtual expert access to them faster. For instance, within 10 to 20 minutes, you can find out if the animal has cancer and get an expert pathologist on the phone. That can really innovate the care provided in rural places where they can't access a specialist."", 'There is a shortage of veterinarians. Why is that, and how does that affect your business?', ""A lot of pets have been added over the last four years. The vast majority of vets, about 60%, are women, but they actually make up 85% to 90% of vets graduating. Women are changing the face of the profession, and they want more balance in their lives. Even if you had the same number of vets, the industry's capacity has shrunk because women are willing to work fewer hours than the vets before them. Helping\xa0vets\xa0leverage tests can allow them to achieve that balance, and diagnostic tests can provide vets\xa0with information before they enter the examination room."", ""What's the opportunity in telemedicine for pets?"", ""Not as big as it is for humans because dogs and cats can't speak and answer detailed questions. There is a role for telemedicine, but I don't think it can be as transformational for animals as it will be for humans."", 'What about cats, which are notoriously anti-vet visits?', ""It could be a great use of telemedicine, but we are really focused on fear-free hospitals where you create either separate entrances or separate rooms so they can't smell everything. We have this thing called Cat Pain IQ, where you take a video of your cat and upload it to our website, and we can tell you if your cat has osteoarthritis using AI."", ""You're a finance specialist. How much do you need to understand the science to be CEO?"", ""You need an appreciation for science because you will make major decisions on what areas to bet on. I have to know, 'Is there a huge customer need for this? Is there a reason to believe this area is promising?' It's a lot more about asking good questions. I am not the expert, but I have smart people surrounding me. The critical part of being a CEO is making sure people feel they can raise different points of view and that I'm interested in hearing all of them."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tyson Foods, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.017 = US$503m ÷ (US$36b - US$6.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Tyson Foods has an ROCE of 1.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Food industry average of 10%."", ' View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Tyson Foods compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Tyson Foods doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 1.7% from 13% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""To conclude, we've found that Tyson Foods is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 6.0% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Tyson Foods   you'll probably want to know about."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

But even after the cut, Walgreens yields 4%. And investors might be eyeing the stock as a potential turnaround play now that management has lowered one of its higher expenses and freed up cash to improve the business.', ""However, weak fundamentals and declining earnings make Walgreens too risky for the potential reward. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are five better Dow dividend stocks to buy now."", ""Apple yields just 0.5%, but that's a result of its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to its dividend."", 'Management has raised its dividend every year since 2012. And over the past 10 years, its dividend has more than doubled while its outstanding share count has fallen 37.7% thanks to buybacks.', ""Apple's cash-cow business model allows it to make dividend raises and buy back stock even during a slowdown, which we've seen play out over the last couple of years."", ""It's a good dividend stock for investors who value a quality business, buybacks, and dividend raises more than a high yield."", 'Like Apple, P&G is not purely a dividend play. It also has a sizable buyback program. And the business is as solid as ever.', 'The stock underperformed the market big time in 2023. Patient investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy a quality business at a good valuation.', 'P&G is one of the best-run businesses out there and arguably the single strongest business in the entire consumer staples sector. It has impeccable pricing power and industry-leading products across a wide variety of categories, including beauty; grooming; healthcare; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care.', ""Management has a track record of developing brands. The company's performance in fiscal 2023 proved that brands really do matter, even for everyday household products like laundry detergent, paper towels, razors, and more."", 'P&G operates a high-margin business, with recession resilience and a diversified business model. The only question investors should ask before buying the stock is whether it is expensive. At a 23.9 price-to-earnings ratio, it is trading around the same multiple as the S&P 500 -- which is reasonable for such a high-quality business even though it is growing slowly.', 'Like P&G, Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. It is one of the most reliable healthcare income stocks out there.', 'But the J&J of today is different than the J&J of the past, mainly because it spun off its consumer-healthcare products into a new company called Kenvue. The idea is that the ""new"" J&J will grow faster, with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.', 'Dividend Kings are known for their reliability, not for chasing growth. But J&J should have no trouble raising its dividend even with a more growth-orientated business. The company is a cash cow, generating far more free cash flow every year than it uses to pay the dividend.', ""J&J also has one of the strongest balance sheets, with total net long-term debt of a mere $6.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for a company with a market cap of $388 billion."", 'With a 3% dividend yield, a reliable business model, and a phenomenal balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend stock that investors can count on in 2024 and beyond.', 'Walmart is another example where the quality of the business, not the yield, is the primary focus. Its shares yield just 1.5% -- which is far less appealing than a stock like J&J.', 'But Walmart is also a Dividend King. It tends to make small dividend raises, choosing instead to reinvest and grow the business.', ""Perhaps Walmart's greatest quality is its ability to perform in a challenging environment. The business is all about undercutting the competition with the lowest prices and providing the best value for its customers. When the economy is faltering, or there's a changing business climate, it is a safe haven with the sophisticated supply chain needed to take market share."", 'Recent conditions provide a good stress test:', ""The company's results have been excellent, even as consumers have shifted from discretionary categories to staples. Walmart doesn't have nearly the same exposure to discretionary categories as its competitors, like Target. Years of long-term investments and expansions, paired with precise execution throughout this challenging time, have helped Walmart put up solid results, given the circumstances."", 'Walmart is the perfect stock for investors looking for a company that is less dependent on a strong economy to do well.', 'Coming in with a 4% dividend yield and nonstop annual payout raises since 1990, Chevron is an underrated dividend stock. It might not generate the consistent cash flow that Walmart, J&J, or P&G do. But it has an incredibly strong balance sheet and can fund the dividend and its operations even when oil is $50 a barrel.', 'Chevron is also geographically diversified and includes much more than just the upstream side of the industry. It has a sizable downstream business and is investing in low-carbon efforts.', ""It can do incredibly well and generate outsize profits when oil is a relatively high or even mediocre price like today's $78 Brent crude per-barrel price. That upside potential, paired with a large margin for error, makes Chevron a reliable income stock in a volatile sector."", 'Apple, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, and Chevron are five completely different companies in five different industries. But all five Dow stocks are components for a reason.', 'Each company should be able to fund dividend raises by growing its business. It sounds simple, but often we see powerful companies gradually lose their edge to competition. Or in the case of Walgreens, it lost market share and sustained ill-fated dividend raises for far too long.', ""All 30 Dow components are meant to represent their respective sector as a role model. Apple, P&G, J&J, Walmart, and Chevron do that well, which can't be said for every Dow stock. All five stocks are worth buying in January for investors looking for quality businesses they can count on, no matter what the new year brings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.', ' View our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'The Executive VP & Chief Human Resources Officer, Peter Fasolo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$170 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$162. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.', ""Johnson & Johnson insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!"", 'If you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).', 'Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Johnson & Johnson insiders own about US$279m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.', ""There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Johnson & Johnson insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Johnson & Johnson and we suggest you have a look."", 'But note: Johnson & Johnson may not be the best stock to buy.

What was once an index dominated by a dozen industrial companies in the late 19th century has evolved into a 30-component index comprised of diverse, time-tested, multinational businesses."", 'Although the share-price-weighted Dow Jones managed to climb to a fresh all-time high in late 2023, the outlook for its 30 components varies quite a bit in the new year. Whereas two Dow stocks stand out as phenomenal buys in 2024, another long-tenured component can be easily passed up by investors.', ""The first no-brainer Dow Jones stock that's begging to be bought in the new year is media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS)."", 'There\'s no sugarcoating the fact that Walt Disney has faced a flurry of headwinds over the past couple of years. The COVID-19 pandemic severely hampered its theme-park operations and film entertainment division. Meanwhile, large operating losses from the company\'s streaming services segment, coupled with weaker ad spending, has led to a challenging environment for the ""House of Mouse."" However, many of these gray clouds should clear in 2024, paving the way for a rebound in Disney stock.', 'In December 2022, China ended its controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy, which involved stringent and unpredictable lockdowns. With China\'s economy still ramping up following years of lockdowns, Walt Disney has seen its theme-park sales growth return to normal. The further we move past the worst of the pandemic, the easier it\'ll be for investors to recognize that Disney\'s organic growth machine is back on track.', ""One of the key factors that powers Walt Disney's revenue and profit growth is its phenomenal pricing power. For instance, the admission price to Disneyland in Southern California has risen by more than 10,000% since the park opened in 1955. This is about 10 times higher than the aggregate rate of inflation for the U.S. economy over the same period."", ""Walt Disney's incredible pricing power is a reflection of the irreplaceability of its characters, storytelling, and engagement. There are plenty of other theme parks to attend and movies to watch, but no other media company has the ability to cross generational gaps with ease to allow grandparents and grandchildren to find common ground through imagination. This competitive advantage that Disney brings to the table is priceless."", ""Another reason to be excited about Walt Disney's prospects in 2024 is the expected operating improvement of its streaming segment. The company hasn't been shy about increasing subscription prices across most tiers."", ""Since Disney+ subscribers tend to be loyal to the brand, it's seen only minimal subscriber attrition as it's increased prices. When combined with mindful cost-cutting, Disney's streaming segment is capable of delivering a profit by the end of the current fiscal year (Disney's fiscal year usually ends in late September)."", 'Walt Disney shares can be scooped up right now for 17 times forward-year earnings, which remains a bargain, considering its expected annualized earnings growth rate of 17% over the next five years.', 'The second Dow stock that investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as ""J&J.""', 'While the Dow Jones Industrial Average was setting new highs in 2023, J&J was weighing it down. The reason for its underperformance over the past year has to do with outstanding litigation concerning its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder.', 'Johnson & Johnson attempted to settle the matter on two occasions last year, with the latest settlement totaling $8.9 billion. However, both attempts were eventually thrown out in court. The unknowns surrounding any financial liability for J&J clearly are holding down its shares.', ""The flip side to the above headwind is that Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies to sport a AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. This credit rating, which is a notch higher than the AA-credit rating bestowed on the U.S. government, signifies S&P's utmost faith that J&J can service and repay its outstanding debts."", ""J&J has more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of Oct. 1, 2023. It's also raking in north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Therefore, there's little worry about the company's potential financial liability."", ""What makes Johnson & Johnson such a screaming buy is its ongoing shift to pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, the company has been laser-focused on expanding its novel-drug portfolio. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, they provide J&J with juicy margins and strong pricing power. Aggressively investing in novel research and collaborations has the company's profit needle pointing decisively higher."", ""As I've previously pointed out, continuity at key leadership positions is also important. You can count on two hands how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Minimal turnover at the top means strategic initiatives are being successfully implemented over long periods."", 'Finally, the price is right with Johnson & Johnson. Opportunistic long-term investors can scoop up shares of J&J for about 15 times forward-year earnings. This represents its lowest forward-year earnings multiple in at least a decade.', 'On the other hand, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense contractor Boeing (NYSE: BA) has given investors every reason to steer clear of its stock in 2024.', ""On paper, Boeing has a pretty clear runway for growth. Production of the 737 MAX is forecast to expand from a current 38 aircraft per month to 50 per month by 2026. Increasing production should lift the company's operating cash flow and give it an opportunity to meaningfully chisel away at its outstanding debt."", 'Furthermore, the price of oil remains elevated due to tight global supply. The longer energy commodity costs remain above historic norms, the more likely commercial airlines are to upgrade their fleets to more fuel-efficient jetliners.', 'Over the next five to 10 years, Boeing could deliver handsomely for its shareholders. But in 2024, it has the potential to be a disaster.', ""Boeing is receiving a lot of attention at the moment due to an incident that occurred this past weekend involving a 737 MAX 9 jetliner that had a section of its fuselage rip off from the plane during flight. This incident, by itself, and the subsequent grounding of other 737 MAX 9 jetliners, isn't why I'd avoid Boeing stock in 2024. However, it's one of a number of instances of Boeing's next-generation aircraft running into production/quality issues. These persistent problems have slowed the production ramp up of Boeing next-gen jetliners and given investors little reason to expect a turnaround in the short term."", ""Boeing's missteps can also be tangibly seen in Wall Street's consensus earnings forecast for the company. At this time last year, Wall Street had been expecting north of $2 in earnings per share (EPS) for 2023. When Boeing reports its fourth-quarter operating results, expectations are that it'll close out 2023 with a full-year loss of greater than $6 per share. That's effectively a $5 billion swing lower in the company's bottom line -- yet shares of Boeing are up over the trailing year."", ""Another reason to avoid Boeing in the current year is its performance during recessions. Though U.S. unemployment data isn't indicative of a recession, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools strongly suggest a deflationary downturn for the U.S. economy is around the corner. Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during the past five recessions."", ""In a stock-picker's market, where valuation matters, buying shares of Boeing at 57 times forward-year earnings doesn't make sense."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

A rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers as well.Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.

The benchmark S&P 500 index soared 24% last year, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new record high.', ""Last year wasn't a rotten one for these two stocks, but they didn't keep pace with the benchmark index. These laggards that underperformed last year have been under enough pressure that they offer above-average dividend yields at the moment."", ""Above-average yields aren't much good to income-seeking investors if companies can't maintain and raise their payouts. These stocks stand out because, in addition to relatively high yields, their underlying businesses benefit from competitive advantages that could allow them to keep raising their payouts in the decade ahead."", ""Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is the world's largest manufacturer of medical devices that health systems purchase in bulk. Its size gives it economies of scale, but this isn't its only advantage. Medtronic also develops more high-value devices, such as replacement heart valves, than any of its competitors."", ""It's still January, but Medtronic has already earned regulatory approvals for multiple devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a deep-brain stimulation system called Percept that can reduce tremors related to epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. In Europe, regulators recently granted marketing approvals for a new insulin-pump sensor and the Micra family of leadless pacemakers."", ""Plowing profits from today's devices into the development of tomorrow's devices is a game plan that has allowed Medtronic to raise its dividend payout for 46 consecutive years. With products that require lots of interaction with physicians before a surgeon installs them, though, the past few years have been extra challenging."", ""Now that healthcare systems are more or less back to normal, total revenue is on the rise. Total sales during the company's fiscal second quarter that ended Oct. 27 rose 5.3% year over year."", 'Medtronic needed 90% of the free cash flow it generated over the past year to meet its dividend commitment, but the company is still a long way from needing to reduce its payout. In fiscal 2024, the company expects adjusted earnings to land in a range between $5.13 per share and $5.19 per share, which is heaps more than necessary to cover a dividend currently set at just $2.76 annually.', ""Shares of Medtronic offer a nice 3.4% yield at recent prices and probably much more once you're ready to retire. With plenty of new devices to sell, and the industry's largest salesforce to sell them, at least another decade of dividend growth seems likely."", ""AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) was the biopharmaceutical arm of Abbott Laboratories before it spun out on its own in 2013.

During the first nine months of 2023, U.S. sales of the anti-inflammatory injection sank 30% year over year to $9.4 billion, and this revenue stream will contract much further. In the E.U., where Humira lost exclusivity in 2018, Humira sales were just 1.7 billion during the first nine months of 2023."", ""In years past, AbbVie invested Humira revenues wisely. Now, it has a handful of huge growth drivers that can more than offset Humira's losses. During the first nine months of 2023, Rinvoq, a tablet for arthritis, and Skyrizi, an injection for psoriasis, grew combined sales by more than 50% year over year to a combined $8.1 billion. Both these blockbusters launched in 2019, so it will be a long time before their sales stop climbing due to a loss of market exclusivity."", ""Medtronic doesn't have extra profits it can use to raise its payout any faster than overall profit growth, but AbbVie does. The drugmaker needed just 42% of the free cash flow it generated over the past year to meet its dividend commitment."", 'AbbVie will more than likely limit its dividend raises until U.S. Humira revenues find a bottom.

I think this is such a huge addressable market that there\'ll be space for different types of products, different administrations, and probably also different efficacy levels,"" Jørgensen said.', ""Jørgensen said this previously undisclosed information will be discussed in more detail at the company's investor day in March."", ""GLP-1s are the dominant treatment for the new obesity market, led by Novo's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) newly approved Zepbound. Investors are waiting to see how the companies compete with each other, and others, for market share."", ""GLP-1s are named for the hormone they mimic in the body that helps to help slow digestion and increase insulin production. They rose to popularity last year — fueled by celebrity interest in the record levels of weight loss achieved by the diabetes drugs Ozempic, from Novo, and Mounjaro, from Lilly. Both products have the same key ingredient as their counterpart obesity drug, semaglutide in Novo's drugs and tirzepatide in Lilly's."", ""But there are other formulations being worked on by other companies — all rushing in to get a piece of what is projected to be a $100 billion or more market by the end of the decade that will touch, potentially, half of the world's population."", 'The strategies vary from finding an oral option to searching for different disease that could benefit from the treatment. Novo already created a stir around the possibilities with a study late last year that showed Wegovy could help reduce the risk of serious heart problems.', 'Pfizer (PFE) has launched an oral GLP-1 program. Roche (RHHBY) re-entered the market after a decade by acquiring obesity drug developer Carmot. Amgen (AMGN) is working on an oral option as well as an injectable, which are part of the broader GLP-1 space.', 'Amgen CEO Robert Bradway said the company has ""about a half dozen or so other medicines in a preclinical state that we\'re excited about in the obesity area.”', 'Merck (MRK), meanwhile, is testing a GLP-1 for potential liver benefits.', 'Roche Pharmaceuticals CEO Teresa Graham told Yahoo Finance the pipeline the company gained from Carmot offers potential beyond the obesity market.', '""In the next couple of years we expect something like 4 billion people around the world to be obese ...

Their benefits appear to extend beyond weight loss and blood sugar control, too, raising the possibility they may also change how obesity is treated.', 'This year should help answer whether any other companies can break Lilly and Novo’s duopoly. A similar dynamic is playing out in oncology, where drugmakers are competing against Merck & Co.’s and Bristol Myers Squibb’s recent dominance.', 'Other storylines in drug pricing, Alzheimer’s and next-generation manufacturing figure to be important as well. Read on for five of the most important questions facing pharma in 2024:', 'Nordisk and Lilly had a big head start developing drugs based around the gut hormone GLP-1 for diabetes and, later, weight loss. Ozempic, Novo’s weekly GLP-1 for blood sugar control used off-label in obesity, has become a popular culture shorthand for weight loss treatment. Lilly, meanwhile, has an answer to Novo with its newly approved Zepbound, which also targets another hormone receptor called GIP.', 'With the GLP-1 drug market expected to reach as high as $90 billion a year, other companies are eager to compete and perhaps even surpass the two leaders. Among them are large pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Amgen and Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as smaller biotechs like Zealand Pharma and Kallyope. To have a chance, aspiring developers will need to improve on the weaknesses of Ozempic — sold as Wegvoy for weight loss — and Zepbound.', 'Chief among them is the drugs’ under-the-skin injection method of delivery. Novo has a GLP-1 diabetes pill called Rybelsus, which has also shown it can deliver weight loss in non-diabetic people who are obese. Lilly has sped development of a drug called orforglipron, while Pfizer has stumbled developing two rival pills.', 'Another way to best the incumbents could be by reducing side effects like nausea and vomiting, which are substantial. In the SELECT trial that showed Wegovy can protect heart health, 17% of participants stopped taking it because of adverse events, twice as many as the dropout rate in the control group.', 'A third approach to beating the on-market GLP-1s may involve preserving lean body mass like muscle. Patients in Wegovy’s clinical trials lost healthy lean body mass as well as fat. A drug that helps people retain muscle tissue could improve their metabolic health and prevent complications like diabetes.', 'Outperforming on cardiovascular benefits would be the surest, but most time-consuming and expensive strategy. While GLP-1 drugs have sparked a shift in how obesity is treated, insurers are still focused on whether treatment can prevent hospitalization or heart complications. Wegovy has set the benchmark by reducing the relative risk of heart attacks, stroke and death by 20%. Lilly could have data later this year.', 'With the recent rush of R&D investment, many would-be competitors could soon hit key mid- and late-stage trial milestones that determine whether their drugs work and have a chance commercially. A shakeout of obesity projects wouldn’t be surprising as the year progresses. — Jonathan Gardner', 'Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol Myers’ Opdivo have dominated the cancer treatment conversation for a decade. Both will reach the end of their patent-protected monopolies as soon as 2028 in the U.S., pushing the two drugmakers to explore commonly used ways of extending market exclusivity, like combination treatment and formulation changes.', 'But drugmakers are also working hard to find what comes next. Researchers have struggled to develop successor medicines that stimulate immune attacks on tumor cells as Keytruda and Opdivo do, with Bristol Myers’ combination drug Opdualag an exception to the rule.', 'The flurry of dealmaking around antibody-drug conjugates in 2023, headlined by Pfizer’s $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, is a sure sign big pharma sees these targeted therapies as a significant new opportunity. Radiopharmaceuticals, which deliver radiation directly to tumor cells, are also drawing significant investment.', 'Bispecific antibodies, which help immune cells find and destroy tumor cells, have proven successful in treating blood cancers like multiple myeloma and lymphoma. They’ve had less success in solid tumors, although they are still being tested in prostate and lung cancer.', 'After years of disappointment, cancer vaccines are finally making gains, too. The messenger RNA technology employed by Moderna, BioNTech and others can be used to create personalized treatments that stimulate an immune response to patients’ tumor cells. Key data from Phase 3 trials of Moderna’s Merck-partnered vaccine in melanoma and lung cancer could come in the next couple of years. — Jonathan Gardner', 'The Inflation Reduction Act is perhaps the biggest overhang on drugmakers in 2024, potentially suppressing revenue for certain top-selling drugs starting in 2026 and dampening investors’ enthusiasm for funding pharmaceutical research and development. This is true even if companies’ drugs aren’t one of the first 10 medicines selected for price negotiation in the Medicare program.', 'That list will be widened over time; up to 20 new drugs a year are set to be added to the negotiation list beginning in 2029. A half-dozen drugmakers have therefore sued the government to block the law from taking effect. The progress of those lawsuits will be closely watched as the clock ticks down to Medicare’s publication of the first 10 drugs’ “maximum fair price,” which is due on Sept. 1.', 'The lawsuits claim, in various ways, that the drug pricing provisions are an unconstitutional violation of the Fifth Amendment’s ban on taking private property for public use without compensation. AstraZeneca has also argued the government’s implementation of the law breaches the Administrative Procedures Act.', 'A Jan. 31 hearing on AstraZeneca’s lawsuit in a Delaware federal district court could give drugmakers a better idea of whether their litigation will succeed.', 'Some legal scholars argue they won’t because companies don’t have a constitutionally protected right to sell drugs to the government. However, those experts note that “some courts have deployed certain legal doctrines in unprecedented fashion,” a trend that could yield a victory against the IRA. — Jonathan Gardner', ""Aduhelm, the Alzheimer's disease drug approved in mid-2021, was supposed to be a blockbuster. As the first new Alzheimer's treatment in decades, it was initially viewed as likely to become an important tool for slowing the disease."", ""That never happened. Doubts over whether the drug actually helped patients, along with controversy over the price set by its developer, Biogen, muted uptake. Prominent treatment centers declined to adopt it, while Medicare, which covers many of those with Alzheimer's in the U.S., refused coverage. Biogen has since all but withdrawn Aduhelm from the market."", 'Expectations are higher for Leqembi, a similar but more clearly effective drug developed by Eisai and Biogen that won full U.S. approval last year. At the J.P.

The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it and should soon make a decision on approval. Analysts view it as more effective, potentially helping convince doctors of the utility of this class of drugs, which target a protein called amyloid.', 'But there are still significant challenges. Treatment involves a special kind of testing for amyloid and the drugs have notable safety risks that need monitoring. Biogen has suggested demand could eventually outstrip the availability of neurologists to prescribe treatment.', '""There\'s a lot of work to do to convince the healthcare system to rearrange itself to treat people with Alzheimer\'s versus ignore them and warehouse them, which is kind of what happens now,"" said Lilly CEO David Ricks during a JPM presentation Tuesday.', 'This year could offer early signs of how well — or whether — that shift is happening. — Ned Pagliarulo', ""The pharmaceutical industry is very good at mass producing chemical pills.

With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) so let's look a bit deeper."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Williams Companies is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.093 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$51b - US$5.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Williams Companies has an ROCE of 9.3%.

However, such a design could have added costs and practical disadvantages, some said.', '“It doesn’t make sense to me why they would do it that way and not have it installed from the inside, where it literally cannot come out unless there is a structural failure in the airframe,” said David Soucie, a former FAA safety inspector and CNN analyst. “Historically, since we have had pressurized airplanes, emergency exits are designed to come inward… so why would they have not done the same thing with this plug?”', 'Soucie said the design of the door plug on the Max 9 may provide some advantages, such as making the plane more readily accessible for maintenance.', 'Robert Ditchey, an aviation consultant, agreed that if the plug were designed to be larger than the hole in the fuselage and installed inside the cabin, this incident likely would not have happened.', '“It should have been installed from the inside to the outside, not the other way around,” Ditchey said of the plug, adding that the exterior installation raises the prospect that the bolts used to secure the plug could have failed.', '“You could have missing bolts,” he said. “They could have had the wrong bolts, or they could have over-torqued the bolts thereby breaking them, or not torqued them enough.”', 'John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that while a different design could theoretically prevent a problem like this from happening, he described this design as adequate so long as proper installation and quality controls are followed.', '“Could you design a plug door for this airplane that would prevent it from going out, the answer is yes you could. It just is going to cost you money and time,” he said. “Was this design adequate is the real question, and if it was installed properly, we wouldn’t be talking about it.”', '“There really is not a big issue with having this door in there, if it was secured right,” Goglia said.', 'A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the door-plug design, citing an active investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. In a staff-wide meeting Tuesday, Boeing’s CEO attributed the incident to a “mistake,” which he did not identify. A company source told CNN that Boeing believes “the mistake in question” was introduced in the aircraft’s manufacturing supply chain.', 'Boeing CEO David Calhoun told CNBC in an interview that aired Wednesday that he is “confident” in the Federal Aviation Administration’s ongoing work with airlines to “inspect each and every one of the airplanes” and make “certain that they’re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.”', 'Federal investigators have determined the components that may have been involved in the door plug coming loose, but they have not yet determined why it blew out, CNN reported Monday. The door plug is typically held in place by stop fittings and has a set of bolts that prevent the door from moving and potentially flying off the plane. Somehow, the plug on the Alaska Airlines flight moved, NTSB’s Clint Crookshanks explained at a news conference Monday night.', 'The FAA on Saturday ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as the cause of the incident is investigated. The order applies to about 171 planes.', 'Former Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo, a CNN analyst, said door plugs have long been used in aviation and, in addition to the Max 9, have been used on planes converted to freighters. But she also questioned this particular design.', 'She said this door plug used on some Max 9s is “designed not to be one of these wedge-doors, that when pressurized it can’t be opened … it’s a door that has to be opened from the outside during some inspections.”', '“That’s the part of the design that to me seems flawed,” Schiavo said.', 'Schiavo said she thinks Friday’s incident will lead to additional door-plug inspection protocols for airlines.', 'Separately, a federal lawsuit filed last year by investors in Spirit AeroSystems – the supplier that makes the fuselage of Boeing’s 737 Max jets – accused the company of “widespread and sustained quality failures” in its products.', 'The suit states that quality failures, which have allegedly ranged from debris in products to missing fasteners and peeling paint, led Boeing to place Spirit on probation from around 2018 to at least 2021. The suit, which was previously reported by the publication The Lever, does not specifically mention door plugs.', 'The suit claims that “constant quality failures resulted in part from Spirit’s culture which prioritized production numbers and short-term financial outcomes over product quality, and Spirit’s related failure to hire sufficient personnel to deliver quality products at the rates demanded by Spirit and its customers including Boeing.”', 'The suit further states that a former Spirit AeroSystems employee who worked as a quality manager and inspector and who was not named in the suit wrote an ethics complaint to the company in 2022 that described an “excessive amount of defects” in products. The former employee believes “Spirit treats moving products down the line as more important than quality,” according to the suit.', 'A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems, Joe Buccino, said in a statement that “Spirit strongly disagrees with the assertions made by plaintiffs in the amended complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Spirit will not comment further as to the pending litigation.”', 'A Boeing spokesperson declined comment on that suit.', 'In April, Spirit AeroSystems identified a production issue on the aft fuselage section of certain 737 models. “This is not an immediate safety of flight issue. We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,” the company then said in a statement.', 'In August, the company disclosed improper holes drilled on the “aft pressure bulkhead” on some models of the 737 fuselage. Both Spirit and Boeing said in statements that the issue was determined not to be an immediate flight-safety concern.', 'In December, Boeing asked airlines to inspect their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after a potential problem was discovered. Boeing said a plane with a missing bolt was fixed but wanted all Max planes in service checked.', 'Boeing has faced scrutiny since two fatal crashes involving 737 Max 8’s– one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019 – that killed 346 people.

What was once an index dominated by a dozen industrial companies in the late 19th century has evolved into a 30-component index comprised of diverse, time-tested, multinational businesses."", 'Although the share-price-weighted Dow Jones managed to climb to a fresh all-time high in late 2023, the outlook for its 30 components varies quite a bit in the new year. Whereas two Dow stocks stand out as phenomenal buys in 2024, another long-tenured component can be easily passed up by investors.', ""The first no-brainer Dow Jones stock that's begging to be bought in the new year is media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS)."", 'There\'s no sugarcoating the fact that Walt Disney has faced a flurry of headwinds over the past couple of years. The COVID-19 pandemic severely hampered its theme-park operations and film entertainment division. Meanwhile, large operating losses from the company\'s streaming services segment, coupled with weaker ad spending, has led to a challenging environment for the ""House of Mouse."" However, many of these gray clouds should clear in 2024, paving the way for a rebound in Disney stock.', 'In December 2022, China ended its controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy, which involved stringent and unpredictable lockdowns. With China\'s economy still ramping up following years of lockdowns, Walt Disney has seen its theme-park sales growth return to normal. The further we move past the worst of the pandemic, the easier it\'ll be for investors to recognize that Disney\'s organic growth machine is back on track.', ""One of the key factors that powers Walt Disney's revenue and profit growth is its phenomenal pricing power. For instance, the admission price to Disneyland in Southern California has risen by more than 10,000% since the park opened in 1955. This is about 10 times higher than the aggregate rate of inflation for the U.S. economy over the same period."", ""Walt Disney's incredible pricing power is a reflection of the irreplaceability of its characters, storytelling, and engagement. There are plenty of other theme parks to attend and movies to watch, but no other media company has the ability to cross generational gaps with ease to allow grandparents and grandchildren to find common ground through imagination. This competitive advantage that Disney brings to the table is priceless."", ""Another reason to be excited about Walt Disney's prospects in 2024 is the expected operating improvement of its streaming segment. The company hasn't been shy about increasing subscription prices across most tiers."", ""Since Disney+ subscribers tend to be loyal to the brand, it's seen only minimal subscriber attrition as it's increased prices. When combined with mindful cost-cutting, Disney's streaming segment is capable of delivering a profit by the end of the current fiscal year (Disney's fiscal year usually ends in late September)."", 'Walt Disney shares can be scooped up right now for 17 times forward-year earnings, which remains a bargain, considering its expected annualized earnings growth rate of 17% over the next five years.', 'The second Dow stock that investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as ""J&J.""', 'While the Dow Jones Industrial Average was setting new highs in 2023, J&J was weighing it down. The reason for its underperformance over the past year has to do with outstanding litigation concerning its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder.', 'Johnson & Johnson attempted to settle the matter on two occasions last year, with the latest settlement totaling $8.9 billion. However, both attempts were eventually thrown out in court. The unknowns surrounding any financial liability for J&J clearly are holding down its shares.', ""The flip side to the above headwind is that Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies to sport a AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. This credit rating, which is a notch higher than the AA-credit rating bestowed on the U.S. government, signifies S&P's utmost faith that J&J can service and repay its outstanding debts."", ""J&J has more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of Oct. 1, 2023. It's also raking in north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Therefore, there's little worry about the company's potential financial liability."", ""What makes Johnson & Johnson such a screaming buy is its ongoing shift to pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, the company has been laser-focused on expanding its novel-drug portfolio. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, they provide J&J with juicy margins and strong pricing power. Aggressively investing in novel research and collaborations has the company's profit needle pointing decisively higher."", ""As I've previously pointed out, continuity at key leadership positions is also important. You can count on two hands how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Minimal turnover at the top means strategic initiatives are being successfully implemented over long periods."", 'Finally, the price is right with Johnson & Johnson. Opportunistic long-term investors can scoop up shares of J&J for about 15 times forward-year earnings. This represents its lowest forward-year earnings multiple in at least a decade.', 'On the other hand, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense contractor Boeing (NYSE: BA) has given investors every reason to steer clear of its stock in 2024.', ""On paper, Boeing has a pretty clear runway for growth. Production of the 737 MAX is forecast to expand from a current 38 aircraft per month to 50 per month by 2026. Increasing production should lift the company's operating cash flow and give it an opportunity to meaningfully chisel away at its outstanding debt."", 'Furthermore, the price of oil remains elevated due to tight global supply. The longer energy commodity costs remain above historic norms, the more likely commercial airlines are to upgrade their fleets to more fuel-efficient jetliners.', 'Over the next five to 10 years, Boeing could deliver handsomely for its shareholders. But in 2024, it has the potential to be a disaster.', ""Boeing is receiving a lot of attention at the moment due to an incident that occurred this past weekend involving a 737 MAX 9 jetliner that had a section of its fuselage rip off from the plane during flight. This incident, by itself, and the subsequent grounding of other 737 MAX 9 jetliners, isn't why I'd avoid Boeing stock in 2024. However, it's one of a number of instances of Boeing's next-generation aircraft running into production/quality issues. These persistent problems have slowed the production ramp up of Boeing next-gen jetliners and given investors little reason to expect a turnaround in the short term."", ""Boeing's missteps can also be tangibly seen in Wall Street's consensus earnings forecast for the company. At this time last year, Wall Street had been expecting north of $2 in earnings per share (EPS) for 2023. When Boeing reports its fourth-quarter operating results, expectations are that it'll close out 2023 with a full-year loss of greater than $6 per share. That's effectively a $5 billion swing lower in the company's bottom line -- yet shares of Boeing are up over the trailing year."", ""Another reason to avoid Boeing in the current year is its performance during recessions. Though U.S. unemployment data isn't indicative of a recession, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools strongly suggest a deflationary downturn for the U.S. economy is around the corner. Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during the past five recessions."", ""In a stock-picker's market, where valuation matters, buying shares of Boeing at 57 times forward-year earnings doesn't make sense."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company due to the separation of the Consumer Health unit, has now become a two-sector company focused on the Innovative Medicine and MedTech fields.Growth in the Innovative Medicine unit is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.

The company operates two reportable segments; Same Store includes communities that the company has owned and have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year, and Non-Same Store and Other includes recently acquired communities and other categories. Key revenue comes from the Same Store segment.', 'Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1994, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis.

The 5-year yield on cost of Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc stock as of today is approximately 5.57%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2023-09-30, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's dividend payout ratio is 1.09, which may suggest concerns about dividend sustainability. However, the company's profitability rank of 8 out of 10, along with consistent positive net income over the past decade, suggests good profitability prospects."", ""Robust growth metrics are essential for the sustainability of dividends.

The central bank had a more dovish tone than anticipated, openly suggesting that a shift away from restrictive monetary policy could be around the corner. The commentary fueled optimism that interest rates will be cut next year."", ""The banks' big price moves were rapid and highly correlated with one another, so it's clear that the stocks were responding to the same macroeconomic news rather than anything company specific."", ""At times in the past, bank stocks have performed poorly when interest rates were too low, so the December rally might seem strange at first glance. Lenders can struggle in excessively low interest rate environments, because their interest income declines while many of their fixed costs remain the same. This drives profit margins lower and threatens the cash flows that can be distributed to the banks' shareholders."", 'This situation is a bit different. Investors have been concerned about a potential recession triggered by high interest rates. A variety of macroeconomic factors combined to fuel high inflation around the world, and the Fed aggressively hiked rates over the past two years in an effort to control inflation.', 'While it was important to combat inflation, the interest rate hikes come with an important trade-off. High rates discourage risk, impact consumer spending, and cause businesses to stop hiring and investing in growth -- in general, they slow the economy down. Both businesses and consumers are simultaneously dealing with high inflation, slowing economic growth, tighter lending standards, and higher borrowing costs.', ""The recent rate hikes are not only crushing demand for bank lending products, they are potentially threatening existing customers' ability to service their loans. With a large amount of corporate debt set to come due next year, high rates extending into 2024 would exacerbate the situation if corporations are unable to refinance at a manageable cost. That's all bad news for banks and their shareholders."", 'The major banks are also suffering from weak capital markets impacting their other divisions. High rates are discouraging activity in the acquisitions and initial public offering markets.

There's a growing set of evidence that interest rate relief is around the corner and a soft landing\xa0will be achieved without a major recession. That would be great news for the banks, but it's hard to feel completely confident about the next few quarters. Central banks around the world are still highly active in response to inflation, and there could be delayed effects to extended high rates that cause unemployment to spike. Recent signals have been bullish, but we aren't out of the woods yet."", ""As it stands, the major banks' Tier 1 capital ratios indicate relatively strong health right now. This is always subject to change, and an unexpected global slowdown could send bank stocks tumbling. Bank of America and Wells Fargo are similar in terms of balance sheet size, health, and valuation. PNC has a somewhat smaller buffer if the economy turns sour. PNC's 3.9% dividend ratio is 130 basis points higher than its peers as a result.

What are you a bit optimistic about heading into these reports?"", ""CHRISTINE SHORT: So despite the lay of the land that you just gave, yes, companies guidance has been lowered or analysts have been lowering-- sell-side analysts have been lowering their guidance. That's because companies have been lowering their guidance."", ""I always take that with a bit of a grain of salt, right? Because going into the season, companies pull back a little bit. They're pretty conservative because they want to lower that bar so that they end up beating, the stock pops, right? It's ultimately better for the stock."", ""So I take company guidance with a grain of salt. We track a proprietary metric called the Late Earnings Report Index. It looks at outlier confirmed-earnings dates, those that have delayed earnings versus those that have advanced them, and that's actually tracking really well. Less companies are delaying earnings going into the season."", 'Why is that important? Well, academic research shows if companies push their earnings out, it tends to correlate highly with bad news being shared on the call, right? If you have bad news to share, you kind of want to push it, right?', ""And so that index is at the lowest we've seen it since we started tracking in 2015. So for us that means companies are less uncertain going into the season, which I think is great because 2023 was marked by uncertainty, right?"", 'Like, are we going to have a soft landing? Are we going to have a hard landing? Is there going to be a recession? It ended up being OK.

He had some pretty concerning comments last--"", ""I think he used the word, we're in the most dangerous period and we're setting up for a range of outcomes. We're hoping for the best.

In any case, history tells us that bear markets, such as the one that began in 2022, are temporary and always lead to bull markets. So, a bull market is indeed coming, and that means it's a great idea to prepare for it by buying stocks that could excel in such an environment."", ""One way of identifying them is by choosing stocks that have suffered in the tough market -- but still have great long-term potential. Two such stocks are Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). They've each dropped 50% or more over the past two years. Here, Motley Fool contributors Adria Cimino and Keith Speights discuss why both healthcare players make great buys ahead of the next bull market."", ""Adria Cimino (Teladoc Health): Teladoc soared during the early days of the pandemic as people flocked to online medical visits, but as that movement cooled down, so did the shares' performance. In fact, Teladoc shares have tumbled more than 90% from their peak in 2021."", ""Though the telemedicine giant continued to deliver increases in revenue and visits, the company moved further away from profitability -- especially after reporting billions of dollars in non-cash goodwill impairment charges linked to an acquisition. And that didn't please investors."", ""But Teladoc has taken action to turn things around, and its move has started to bear fruit. Early last year, Teladoc pledged to balance its efforts to drive revenue growth with efforts to favor profitability. Throughout the year, its quarterly results surpassed its goals. Teladoc's commitment to whole person care and its strengths in chronic care have also helped it increase revenue and gain new members."", ""These two areas could help this market leader stay on top for two reasons. A service addressing all of a person's healthcare needs is convenient -- so it's easy to imagine members staying within the system rather than making appointments with other healthcare providers outside of it. Expertise in chronic care is also vital, considering that almost half of Americans have at least one chronic condition."", ""Teladoc already serves more than half of Fortune 500 companies and has said in recent times that it's won over clients from competitors thanks to its whole person offerings. So Teladoc is already in a position of strength. If the company can make progress along the path of profitability, the shares -- now trading at nearly their lowest ever in relation to sales -- could take off. And a bull market environment, which generally favors growth companies, may offer Teladoc an additional push."", ""Keith Speights (Pfizer): It might seem as if everything is going in the wrong direction for Pfizer. The big drugmaker's revenue declined 42% year over year in the first nine months of 2023. Earnings plunged 79%. Unsurprisingly, Pfizer's share price is also more than 50% below the peak set in late 2021 and is down more than 40% over the last 12 months."", ""However, I think there's a much better story for Pfizer than many investors realize. Those negative trends just mentioned are almost entirely due to sinking demand for the company's COVID-19 products. It wouldn't surprise me, though, if 2024 turns out to be the trough year for COVID-related sales."", ""There are several reasons to be encouraged about Pfizer's prospects looking beyond COVID. The company expects to add around $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from new products and new indications for existing products. Management thinks that another $25 billion in additional annual revenue will come from business development deals."", ""I view Pfizer's projections as quite attainable. The drugmaker has already launched several new products that should be key to its success, including RSV vaccine Abrysvo and multiple myeloma drug Elrexfio. Pfizer has also been busy on the business development front, acquiring Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics in 2022 and Seagen in 2023."", ""We can't ignore Pfizer's dirt cheap valuation, either. Shares currently trade at a forward earnings multiple of just over 13. Even if we assumed that the company wouldn't make a penny from its COVID products going forward, Pfizer's valuation still looks more attractive than its big pharma peers'. Those COVID products will rake in a lot more than a penny, though: Pfizer projects that 2024 combined sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid will total around $8 billion."", ""Last, but not least, Pfizer's dividend yield stands at nearly 5.7%. Thanks to this dividend, the stock won't have to achieve huge gains to deliver market-beating total returns."", ""The next bull market could boost both of these struggling yet promising stocks. But most importantly, these companies have what it takes to excel -- not just in one particular market phase, but over the long term. That's why it's a great idea to get in on them now, while they're trading at reasonable valuations, and potentially benefit as they progress toward their goals over time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Teladoc Health right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Teladoc Health, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Teladoc Health wasn't one of them.

Stirring ""AI"" and ""Blockchain"" together into a buzzword stew to help build ""trust in news"" feels like great press fodder, especially if you\'re an aging media conglomerate with credibility issues. We\'ve all seen Succession, haven\'t we?', ""But let's set the irony aside for a moment and take Fox and its new tool seriously. On the deep-fake end, Fox says people can load URLs and images into the Verify system to determine if they're authentic, meaning a publisher has added them to the Verify database. On the licensing end, AI companies can use the Verify database to access (and pay for) content in a compliant way."", ""Blockchain Creative Labs, Fox's in-house technology arm, partnered with Polygon, the low-fee, high-throughput blockchain that works atop the sprawling Ethereum network, to power things behind the scenes. Adding new content to Verify essentially means adding an entry to a database on the Polygon blockchain, where its metadata and other information are stored."", ""Unlike so many other crypto experiments, the blockchain tie-in might have a point this time around: Polygon gives content on Verify an immutable audit trail, and it ensures that third-party publishers don't need to trust Fox to steward their data."", ""Verify in its current state feels a bit like a glorified database checker, a simple web app that uses Polygon's tech to keep track of images and URLs. But that doesn't mean it's useless – particularly when it comes to helping legacy publishers navigate licensing deals in the world of large language models."", ""We went ahead and uploaded some content into Verify's web app to see how well it works in day-to-day use, and it didn't take us long to notice the app's limitations for the consumer use case."", 'The Verify app has a text input box for URLs. When we pasted in a Fox News article from Tuesday about Elon Musk and deep fakes (which happened to be featured prominently on the site) and pressed ""enter,"" a bunch of information popped up attesting to the article\'s provenance. Along with a transaction hash and signature – data for the Polygon blockchain transaction representing the piece of content – the Verify app also showed the article\'s associated metadata, licensing information, and a set of images that appear in the content.', '', 'We then downloaded and re-uploaded one of those images into the tool to see if it could be verified. When we did, we were shown similar data to what we saw when we inputted the URL. (When we tried another image, we could also click on a link to see other Fox articles that the image had been used in. Cool!)', 'While Verify accomplished these simple tasks as advertised, it\'s hard to imagine many people will need to ""verify"" the source of content that they lifted directly from the Fox News website.', 'In its documentation, Verify suggests that a possible user of the service might be a person who comes across an article on social media and wants to figure out whether it is from a putative source. When we ran Verify through this real-world scenario, we ran into issues.', ""We found an official Fox News post on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) featuring the same article that we verified originally, and we then uploaded X's version of the article's URL into Verify. Even though clicking on the X link lands one directly onto the same Fox News page that we checked originally – and Verify was able to pull up a preview of the article – Verify wasn't able to tell us if the article was authentic this time around."", ""Mark Ruffalo blasts Musk's X for allowing 'disinformation' after sharing AI fakes of Trump on Epstein flight https://t.co/oxVxwyhuPD"", '— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 10, 2024', ""We then screen-grabbed the thumbnail image from the Fox News post: one of the same Fox images that we uploaded last time around. This time, we were told that the image couldn't be authenticated. It turns out that if an image is manipulated in any way – which includes slightly-cropped thumbnails, or screenshots whose dimensions aren't exactly right – the Verify app will get confused."", 'Some of these technical shortcomings will surely be ironed out, but there are even more complicated engineering problems that Fox will need to contend with if it hopes to help consumers suss out AI-generated content.', ""Even when Verify is working as advertised, it can't tell you whether the content was AI-generated – only that it came from Fox (or from whatever other source uploaded it, presuming other publishers use Verify in the future). If the goal is to help consumers discern AI-generated content from human content, this doesn't help. Even trusted news outlets like Sports Illustrated have become embroiled in controversy for using AI-generated content."", ""Then there's the problem of user apathy. People tend not to care so much about whether what they're reading is true, as Fox is surely aware. This is especially true when people want something to be true."", ""For something like Verify to be useful for consumers, one imagines it'll need to be built directly into the tools that people use to view content, like web browsers and social media platforms. You could imagine a sort of badge, à la community notes, that shows up on content that's been added to the Verify database."", ""It feels unfair to rag on this barebones version of Verify given that Fox was quite proactive in labeling it as beta. Fox also isn't only focused on general media consumers, as we have been in our testing."", 'Fox\'s partner, Polygon, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk that ""Verify establishes a technical bridge between media companies and AI platforms"" and has additional features to help create ""new commercial opportunities for content owners by utilizing smart contracts to set programmatic conditions for access to content.""', 'While the specifics here are somewhat vague, the idea seems to be that Verify will serve as a sort of global database for AI platforms that scrape the web for news content – providing a way for AI platforms to glean authenticity and for publishers to gate their content behind licensing restrictions and paywalls.', 'Verify would probably need buy-in from a critical mass of publishers and AI companies for this sort of thing to work; for now, the database just includes around 90,000 articles from Fox-owned publishers including Fox News and Fox Sports. The company also says it has opened the door for other publishers to add content to the Verify database, and it has also open-sourced its code to those who want to create new platforms based on its tech.', 'Even in its current state, the licensing use case for Verify seems like a solid idea – particularly in light of the thorny legal questions that publishers and AI companies are currently reckoning with.', 'In a recently filed lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, the New York Times has alleged its content was used without permission to train AI models. Verify could provide a standard framework for AI companies to access online content, thereby giving news publishers something of an upper hand in their negotiations with AI companies.']"

We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 14.03x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 13.48x, which means if you buy Fox today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe that Fox should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, Fox’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Fox's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 54%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FOXA’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at FOXA?

The central bank had a more dovish tone than anticipated, openly suggesting that a shift away from restrictive monetary policy could be around the corner. The commentary fueled optimism that interest rates will be cut next year."", ""The banks' big price moves were rapid and highly correlated with one another, so it's clear that the stocks were responding to the same macroeconomic news rather than anything company specific."", ""At times in the past, bank stocks have performed poorly when interest rates were too low, so the December rally might seem strange at first glance. Lenders can struggle in excessively low interest rate environments, because their interest income declines while many of their fixed costs remain the same. This drives profit margins lower and threatens the cash flows that can be distributed to the banks' shareholders."", 'This situation is a bit different. Investors have been concerned about a potential recession triggered by high interest rates. A variety of macroeconomic factors combined to fuel high inflation around the world, and the Fed aggressively hiked rates over the past two years in an effort to control inflation.', 'While it was important to combat inflation, the interest rate hikes come with an important trade-off. High rates discourage risk, impact consumer spending, and cause businesses to stop hiring and investing in growth -- in general, they slow the economy down. Both businesses and consumers are simultaneously dealing with high inflation, slowing economic growth, tighter lending standards, and higher borrowing costs.', ""The recent rate hikes are not only crushing demand for bank lending products, they are potentially threatening existing customers' ability to service their loans. With a large amount of corporate debt set to come due next year, high rates extending into 2024 would exacerbate the situation if corporations are unable to refinance at a manageable cost. That's all bad news for banks and their shareholders."", 'The major banks are also suffering from weak capital markets impacting their other divisions. High rates are discouraging activity in the acquisitions and initial public offering markets. This hurts the investment banking segments of the major banks.', ""The banking sector is full of bellwethers that reflect broader economic health. There's a growing set of evidence that interest rate relief is around the corner and a soft landing\xa0will be achieved without a major recession. That would be great news for the banks, but it's hard to feel completely confident about the next few quarters. Central banks around the world are still highly active in response to inflation, and there could be delayed effects to extended high rates that cause unemployment to spike. Recent signals have been bullish, but we aren't out of the woods yet."", ""As it stands, the major banks' Tier 1 capital ratios indicate relatively strong health right now. This is always subject to change, and an unexpected global slowdown could send bank stocks tumbling. Bank of America and Wells Fargo are similar in terms of balance sheet size, health, and valuation. PNC has a somewhat smaller buffer if the economy turns sour. PNC's 3.9% dividend ratio is 130 basis points higher than its peers as a result. All three stocks have a beta around 1.2, so they're likely to be more volatile than the market in general if we hit a rough patch."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

They follow the many financial media outlets which through TV and social media, display and promote such a short term memory, quoting stocks minute to minute, throwing the bells and whistles of our attention at whatever has just happened. Well, as a Fool, I love to look back. The lessons we really learn, and earn are a consequence of observing and living through history measured in years, not hours or days. Well, for years I wrote short essays to kick off our monthly Motley Fool issues, snail mailed out to members. Well, today the Motley Fool is pretty much fully digital. We don't do paper copies anymore, and we don't do opening essays. But I put a lot of time into those essays, and they occurred over a long narrative arc of market history 2002 to 2017, 15 years worth of investing lessons in Motley Fool stock advisor and Motley Fool Rule Breakers. In this world of now, I say you and I start 2024 by getting smarter, happier, and richer today for the lessons than then essays from yesterday. Only on this week's Rule Breaker investing."", ""Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. There it is, the sound of rules being broken, or maybe a window. You get to hear it once again as we kick off 2024, the 10th year of this podcast. We'll actually celebrate our 10th in July of this year that's when Rule Breaker Investing started. I bet I have some new listeners this week. A lot of people make New Year's resolutions around money and investing, so if you're new to the Motley Fool, I'm really glad that you're getting to hear this particular podcast because it's going to remind you of some of the eternal verities, some of the truths learned over years. I think something that I hope you'll appreciate as a fellow fool is our interest in learning lessons that we can use going forward, but not just from the here and now, in this case from the past. Let's get into it. Essays from yesterday, volume 5, that means this is the fifth in the series."", ""The previous episode was on February 1st of last year. A couple of ground rules about how this series works. I'm going to be looking back at four essays written in the past, and first of all, you should know I completely randomize which essay I'll be sharing with you. I wrote about 270 of them over those 15 years, and I don't know which number is going to come up ahead of time. Until we plan this podcast, I don't know what I'll be speaking about and I randomize it. Now, I wish I could cherry pick my best and favorite essays, but nope, it is completely randomized and I think that's part of the fun of it. You get to see me make some real mistakes in terms of the stocks I'm mentioning. In some cases, you get to be strapped into the way-back machine. We're here together thinking forward from distant perches in the past, thinking forward about where we are today. We get to look them up, we get to see how those stocks have done, we get to see how these thoughts have done, and we're going to have some doozies both ways. The second ground rule is these are always presented in chronological order. From the earliest one I randomized to the latest. For example, the first of my four essays from yesterday, this go round was published in December 2005."", ""Eighteen years ago, speaking of which, Rick Engdahl, throw me some way back music as we go back in time, strapping ourselves into the time machine of essays from yesterday, we're back now, alighting on the month of December 2005. Essay Number 1 is from Rule Breakers in December of 2005. It is entitled A Service, Not a Product. Each of these four essays is about 500 words, a short essay. Here's Number 1, dear fellow Fool. I've said it in the past and I say it again to you now, Rule Breakers is a service not a product. Yes, we put together a paper newsletter and send it your way every month. That may look and feel like a product, but the truth is, we are orienting ourselves as best we can to give you a service that is interactive, electronic, responsive. A service that is about you, not us. Products are always about us. Companies that make them tend to mass manufacture the same thing and put it out on shelves or tables and fill the world with their product. But services are about you."", ""They are crafted to serve the customer, and not every customer wants or needs the same thing, particularly when it comes to financial advice. At Rule Breakers, we get questions every day from new members ranging from the very technical nanotech question to someone simply asking, which of the companies on the scorecard should I buy as a new subscriber? What you want to get out of this service is different from the next Motley Fool Rule breakers subscriber, just as what one Fool brings to the service is different from the next Fool. This Fool is here to ensure that we continually improve over time at delivering you a great service, and to me that starts with, well, a great place to start. To that end, we have launched a new discussion board online at Rule Breakers central titled simply start here. Just go to rule breakers.fool.com and find it in the tool box on the main page. I encourage you to bookmark that page particularly new subscribers, and I hope all breakers will make frequent use of it. One of our new staffers, the esteemed TMFBreakerDan, formerly BroadwayDan, will take time off from his real job as a TV in Hollywood script writer and he will welcome you, answer your questions, and guide you as you get started with our service. It's probably worth noting that in a recent posting, Dan described himself as '' The TMF guy that tends to deal more with the amuse section of our mission statement, educate, amuse, rich, and perfect ''."", ""If Rule Breakers were merely a newsletter, there'd be no such thing as the start here discussion board. But Rule Breakers is a service we're here to serve. Yes, we pride ourselves on serving up superior investment returns, which we expect most of our subscribers may appreciate. But we also pride ourselves on serving up superior help for all new comers and old comers and a great place to get started for all new subscribers is Rule Breakers start here. A final note this month. I hope you will take two minutes out to contribute to our philanthropy 2005 campaign. On November 16th, we will name five worthy charities that break the rules themselves, contribute to one or more of them by visiting www.philanthropy.com and you'll feel great about giving well this holiday season. That is the end of the December 2005."", ""A service, not a product essay. One thing that I appreciate looking backward now, 18 years later, is that focus on serving. I hope if you're a Motley Fool member, and I hope you are, I hope you still feel served that we are there to serve you, to think about you and your investment goals first, and to do our darnedest, our Foolish best to help you get there. I remember that I was reading back then, one of my favorite business books about marketing. If you're a marketer or somebody who's interested in entrepreneurship, I highly recommend selling the Invisible by Harry Beckwith. This is a wonderful, highly readable book. Each chapter is about a page long. Each page ends with a bolded assertion, a summary lined at the bottom. It's a highly readable, fun book, but it's really about service and service marketing. Because when you are selling a Tesla, you are selling something visible, something tangible, a product. When you are selling a stock pick or a Motley Fool service, you're selling, in Harry Beckwith's words, the invisible, you're selling intangible, you're selling trust, you're selling hope you're selling the best service that you can bring to your served members so that focus on serving, I hope you still find is right there at the heart of the Motley Fool 18 years later. Indeed, I will note that we have many more people serving in 2023 than we did back then."", ""In fact, I think it's fair to say the size of our member services team today at the Motley Fool, which is somewhere between 50 and 100 people, when you start throwing in the techies and support that they get. That was probably about the size of our company when I was writing this particular essay. The intent to help is the same. We help in different ways over the course of time. I do want to highlight Dan Rubin, a great example of Foolishness. I mentioned him in that essay. I love to call out members of our team and investors and analysts. Of course, a big part of Rule Breaker investing the podcast is me regularly having on Motley Fool personalities like Bill Barker and Yasser El-Shimy playing the Market Cap Game Show with me just a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to feature our people. Dan Rubin is a great example of somebody who signed on as a Motley Fool member, but then began to volunteer for us and help and answer questions in our forums. Our forums do continue to this day. They're not the same interface. They're quite different in a lot of ways. But you can absolutely, as a Rule Breaker member, go right to the site and you'll see the Community button in the upper right. Click it and the first thing you see is the category Rule Breakers. Just ask where you can ask questions, help desk questions, personal finance questions."", ""The interactivity of the Motley Fool has been important for me from our earliest days when we started on America Online forums for those who would remember what those are anyway, Dan Rubin, a really talented writer. In my experience, writers really shine on forums in the Internet. People who can make us smarter, happier, and richer through their written word continue to add a lot of value to our site every day. I also want to just call out at the end of that essay, the reference to philanthropy, which is what the Motley Fool used to do back in the day, a charity drive around the holidays each year. These days it's been much more. Professionalized and scaled, we now have the Motley Fool Foundation. I hope you'll visit us at foolfoundation.org to see the work we're doing trying to create financial freedom for more people. Indeed, our vision one day is financial freedom for all. If you're not familiar with the Motley Fool Foundation, there's a quick advertisement. I hope you'll click in and maybe give some time, treasure and talent, whether it's in December of any given year, just weeks ago, or hey, here we are at the start of a new year with new resolutions and new possibilities."", ""I want to say before we go on to essay Number 2, that this was not the most interesting essay to read. It's more about the nature of Motley Fool services. The next one is a big contrast with that, but it is worth noting that some of the focus of our writing and our efforts over time has just been to help members, especially newcomers, know how to use our services. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that any Motley Fool member, hearing me right now, can always 24 by 7 dial up our Motley Fool member services. If you have questions about how to use Motley Fool services, we're there to help. But anyway, yes, sometimes I use that page one essay to do just that. Well, let's strap our way back into the time machine. Again, we always go from earliest to latest. It's time to proceed forward in time."", ""Here we are. Two years later, it's December of 2007, and my essay, Dips, Wait for Dips. This was the introduction to the December 2007 issue of Motley Fool Rule Breakers. Of course, back then we thought of these as issues. We gave them months and yes, we were mailing them out to people. Much more of a traditional newsletter these days, again, our service is much more dynamic. We write a lot more on a monthly basis in Motley Fool Rule Breakers than we did with my Page 1 essay way back when. But since we're way back when, let's get started."", ""Dear fellow Fools, do you buy on Dips? Many investors do. But let me explain why I don't. For starters, some of our stocks never really dip, or at least not for long. If you follow the logic, you'll see that these are often our best performers, because after all, they never dipped. Which means that if you're sitting back waiting for the dip, you'll miss the sizzle. I prefer sizzle to dip. Look at our three best Rule Breakers picks so far in 2007, a Quantum Chipotle and Sigma designs, the three, two have dipped, but only briefly and only from well higher than where they were picked. Chipotle went from 90-80 in a two-week period in July, Sigma Designs fell from 60-52 in a few days in early November. If you're a Dippy investor, I won't call you a dip looking to dip your way into the Rule Breakers scorecard. You may not have bought our three best 2007 picks unless you were particularly lucky or adept. Let me say that again. If you insisted on buying on Dips, you very likely didn't buy any of our three best stocks of 2007. Even if you did buy Chipotle at 80 or sigma at 52, you market timer, you guess what Rule Breakers recommended Chipotle at 60 and Sigma at 31. In other words, they were already up 33% or 67% by the time you perfectly timed your dip. I said I wouldn't do that."", ""Sorry. By contrast, our three worst 2007 selections, Cineron Medical, Force Protection and Jones Soda, two of which come courtesy of yours truly have offered investors numerous dips on their ways to 30-40% declines. Thus the Dippy investor who looks for dips as precursors to buying, has now established positions in our three worst performing stocks. This is how people join services like Rule Breakers and stock advisor with wonderful winning scorecards and then wind up losing money and canceling their memberships. It's not for me they say after missing all the winners and buying all the losers dips. I'll stop. Let's talk about the solution. How do I suggest approaching Rule Breakers or even investing in general? Make a commitment to the companies you want to own, not the stocks you're going to buy on Dips. Be an investor, not a share price guesser. Once you've committed to plunking down a long-term investment in any of our stocks, buy it, all right then, which is what I usually do, or if you like, buy in thirds. But if you're going to buy in thirds, please do it based on time, not share price moves. Tell yourself I'm going to establish a full position in the stock over the next quarter, so I'll buy on the 15th each of the next three months. If you want to own many of our best stocks, this is the surest way. You'll end up an Intuitive Surgical investor instead of just a dip Intuitive Surgical watcher. Fool on."", ""That was my essay, dips wait for dips. In fact, I love that line so much, I love the essay so much, I made it a great quote from volume 10 when I did great quotes volume 10, although I've since tweaked it from dips, buy on dips to dips, wait for dips and a brief explanation there. If you buy on a dip and it truly was a dip and it worked for you, I don't want to criticize that. We all buy on dips, especially if we're just dollar-cost averaging, investing steadily every two weeks or so and the market or a given stock goes down for a while, we did truly buy on a dip. That's not something that I want to decry. I will decry though, and obviously, M in that essay, people who wait for dips, people who think the way to get started investing is to wait for a stock to go down or wait for the market to go down. History will show, statistics will show the market tends to go up over time, so waiting doesn't make a lot of sense. I realize, especially if you're new, it can be fearful to all of a sudden start investing."", ""But if you just space it out and invest patiently over time, every two weeks, or as I suggested, buying a full position in thirds, let's say 1/3 each month, spaced out over a quarter, that's a much easier way to toe, dip your way into investing period, or into a given stock, especially if you're feeling some apprehension, so I wouldn't say dips, buy on dips, which is what I once said, I would say Dips, wait for Dips. Indeed, I think it was a mailbag episode for this podcast years ago where somebody made that point, and I said I agree with you and I'm changing up my phrase, so I have once again the Motley Fool community, my fellow Rule Breakers, to thank for helping us hone our words and thoughts over the course of time. Well, I hope it was fairly persuasive to you that you should stay focused on regular investing and not, in my words, wait for dips. But the one other thing I want to reflect about that essay is the tale of Three Stocks. The three best Rule Breakers picks I mentioned in that episode, and what happened to them since. Before we go there, the three worst selections mentioned in that essay, Cineron, Medical Force Protection, and Jones Soda. You can look them up, I'm pretty sure those didn't do very well. Indeed many in Motley Fool Rule Breaker pick over the years has been a loser, that's something I don't shy away from. It's something with my venture capital mentality, that's something that I think is how Rule Breaker investing works. You have to be willing to accept losers in order to get the great winners."", ""Let's look at the three stocks that I mentioned as the winners in 2007. Let's first look at Sigma designs. I'm sorry to say Sigma designs even though it had a great 2007, as I mentioned, that essay didn't have a great history and ended up getting bought out 11 years later by Silicon Labs for a paltry sum less than $500 million, it was a very poor performer over time. Let's next look at a quantive. Well, it was May of 2007 when I launched a contest at Motley Fool Rule Breakers. I said it out loud to the world at large, into our membership. I said there's this new term I want to invent. It's when a stock makes more money in one day than you paid for it way back when. When a stock's daily gain exceeds your cost basis, I said, submit me a term, what should that be called, and over the course of several weeks, 300 different terms were nominated by our Rule Breakers membership, and I decided I loved the winning phrase. Ultimately, I chose Spiffy Pop. Spiffy-pop. Why? Well, because people talk all the time about how this or that stock popped. It's very much a one day thing. Hey, do you think that stock might pop? Look at that stock, pop. But when a stock pops in a certain way, when it rises more in a single day than you paid for it with your cost basis, that should have a special term, so we revealed spiffy pop to the world on a Thursday."", ""A Thursday in May, and that very Friday, the very next day, a stock in the Rule Breakers service, Spiffy popped. It was like magic, and it was a quantive. The stock I'm talking about here was bought out by Microsoft, and just to put some clothes on it, we had purchased shares of a quantive for Motley Fool Rule breakers recommending it first, on December 20 of 2006, it was at $25.14 a share. So right around $25 a share, and as it turns out, just six months later on May 18, 2007, a quantive went from $35.87-$63.79. It went up 78% in a single day. That was quite a pop by any measure, thanks to Microsoft's generosity, paying a huge premium for a quantave, the advertising data company. But since we'd only paid $25 a share for that stock to go up $27 a share in a single day, that day, the day after we invented the term, well, that was quite a spiffy pop. So just a little bit of Rule Breakers lore there for you. So a quantive ended up being a great winner, but very brief. Which leads me to the final stock mentioned in that essay, one that we have a long association with. I hope you noticed it. It was Chipotle, ticker symbol CMG. When I think about Chipotle, the first thing I think of is that we've bought and held the stock since January 17 of 2007. Again, this essay from yesterday was written at the end of 2007. Rick Munarz, the wonderful long running stock picking Fool that I've enjoyed so much over the years, both Rick's writings at Fool.com, and his ongoing stock picking at Motley Fool Rule breakers."", ""Rick had picked Chipotle at $60 a share on January 17, 2007. Here's a fun fact about Chipotle. You may know this if you're a shareholder. The company has never once split it's stock, so that cost basis of $60 in January 2007 can be now compared with Chipotle's present perch where it trades for, well, when I last checked $2,305. It's gone from 60 to over 2,300 in the nearly 17 years we've held it, that is a 38 bagger. Now, there are many dips, there always will be over the course of a 16 or 17 year association with any stock. Do you remember those health scares that Chipotle has had? It's gotten bad, it had a change in CEO's. There are reasons that the stock underperformed for multi year periods over these nearly 17 years, and yet at the heart of Rule Breaker investing, this involves finding great companies and sticking with them over time, so you could have bought all six of those stocks, several of them, losers, some quite bad. You would have enjoyed a magical spiffy pop with a quantive. You have enjoyed a spectacular investment with Chipotle, and indeed, Chipotle as we speak is trading at all time highs. It's market cap these days, clocking in at about $63 billion. Yeah, perhaps some dips, dipped their way in at the right moment, here and there, but for most of the rest of us, we common Fools, Fools greater than sign dips, we've been rewarded simply by buying and holding and adding to this great company over the course of time, and as has also been true of so much of the investing I've seen in my life, one great winner wipes out all of your losers and leaves you with a lot of money still sitting on the table. If you just look at the six stocks in this essay, you see that happening once again. Back in our time machine from 2007 December, we moved to February 2010, and this was my page 1 for Motley Fool Stock Advisor, February of 2010. It had been a brutal couple of years for investors. That 2007 price we got for Chipotle skyrocketed. Do you remember the stock market if you were investing with me, dear fellow Fool? It had quite a 2007, 2008/9 one of the worst periods, not just in Motley Fool history, but in US stock market history. So here we find ourselves now in 2010, February. This is the first page of Motley Fool Stock Advisor."", 'Five years have passed since my brother Tom wrote his compelling November 2004 intro about ""why he would win by when he meant beat his brother\'s returns."" A month later in our December 2004 issue, I, David, writing this month took up his challenge and explained why I will win. Now five years later, I want to update my thoughts. First things first, five years later, I\'m winning. With this issue I\'m making my 96th consecutive monthly stock peak in Stock Advisor. Those 96 peaks average a mean return of plus 68%. By comparison, the S&P 596 monthly increments average only plus 2.9% over the exactly comparable periods. That means that Stock Advisor members, following my side of the scorecard, presently average outperforming the market, their S&P 500 index fund, if you will, by 65 percentage points per peak. Remember that many academic circles continue to avow that beating the market is not possible to do consistently, that outperformance is some combination of pure chance or statistical anomaly. I hope you don\'t think so. I\'ve never thought so. Before asserting a few reasons why I think I\'m beating the market and my brother Tom check out Tom\'s side of the scorecard. He\'s also making his 96th consecutive monthly pick this month. They each average a gain of plus 42.8% way ahead of the averages. Make no mistake, Tom and team Tom are performing exceptionally. You can build a pretty good franchise or at least a portfolio off of his side of the scorecard alone. Five years later, Tom is now beating the market by almost 40 percentage points per pick. Yet our team, Dave Stocks are up 65 percentage points per pick. Modesty in admittedly short supply this month prevents me from calling that a blowout, we\'re winning. But why? Well, return once again to that December 2004 intro I wrote.', 'Any member can all past issues are available to you via our archives. You\'ll see me clearly describing my style based on ""slugging percentage"", a concept I borrow from my beloved game of baseball. The aim is to earn multi bagger investments, investments that multiply numerous times from your original cost basis that, in my parlance, spiffy pop. In order to achieve this, you have to fulfill three conditions. One, find companies with unquantifiable greatness, a secret sauce edge. Two, ensure these companies benefit from undeniable long term trends, and three, get in early and don\'t haggle on price. Those three tenants have guided us to outstanding performance. They are also the three rules laid out in our investing the Stock Advisor Way article, which was penned in August of last year and is mandatory reading for all members searchable on our site if you haven\'t previously found it. Every day I find media outlets, fellow investors and professional analysts giving reasons to sell the market, get out, run for the hills or great individual stocks. It\'s overvalued. It\'s due for a breather. But the single greatest factor behind why I\'m winning, winning a game that I hope will never end is simply that team Dave buys great stocks and we hold them. We may even add to them, we vary, infrequently exit them.', ""Happy New Year and good luck to all of us over the next five years. That is the end of the February 2010 essay. I'm glad I said happy New Year then, because that's exactly what I'm saying to you now. Happy New Year. I'll reiterate good luck to all of us over the next five years. Investors didn't need much luck over those next five years. As bearish as many people were on the market as 2010 began, the next five years would end up being outstanding and both I in Rule Breakers, and then Tom and his team in stock advisor would just a couple of years later pick Tesla as a great example of a Rule Breaker stock and one that we've bought and held over more than 10 years now. Leading us again to just outstanding performance. Performance that wipes out many a bad pick along the way. The beauty of that essay to me is that it pretty succinctly conveys the three things that I've always been looking for in investing. Just to summarize, briefly, find companies with unquantifiable greatness."", ""That means they have something that you can't quite express for example, if you have Elon Musk and we don't, you have unquantifiable greatness. It's hard to put exactly a number on the value of someone like Elon Musk. This comes by the way, from not a huge Musk fan boy. Somebody who is a fan, not a fan boy. Somebody who has some disagreements sometimes with what Elon has said or done. But if you look at the full record of his life and his creation of really great businesses that have gone on to do important and beautiful things in this world, Tesla being one example, you'll see that that is unquantifiable. The greatness of a great CEO, a founding CEO. Number 2, ensure these companies benefit from undeniable long term trends. Thinking back to Intuitive Surgical, which is a great stock we've held for a long time in Motley Fool Rule Breakers which I referenced in that previous essay, Intuitive Surgical is by far and away the category leader for robotic surgery. That is, robots assisting humans. Humans using robots in order to perform surgery much better. Much faster, much safer, much more effectively with less invasiveness. Intuitive Surgical is one of those companies benefiting from undeniable long term trends in this case, robots, and technology assisting in healthcare. That is a great example of that second trade off and look for. Then third, get in early, and don't haggle on price. As I wrote in the essay, get in early means, when you hear about something good, maybe buy a few shares. Get to know it over time and add to that position over time. I've never been first to any stock I've ever bought as a public market investor. The venture capitalists and private investors themselves got there before we ever did. But when I can quote for you, a 38 bagger like Chipotle or a 100 bagger like Tesla."", ""We've had a few others over the years. You know that we got in early as public market investors. Something that you can do too, but importantly, we're also still holding these stocks. Most people who miss great investments like Apple and Amazon, which we have not, most people had them for a little while, maybe doubled their money and were satisfied or heard a friend or somebody on TV telling them they should sell, because the stock was high or the market was going down and they paid an incredible opportunity cost not holding those companies over time. That's something that my brother Tom has been doing well from the very beginning. Something I've done well too. I think Tom is having some fun with the sibling rivalry, stirring the pot back there in 2004 to get members interested. I'm really happy to say both of us have substantially beaten the market over time. We're not doing it for ourselves or each other, we're doing it for you. That's what Motley Fool services are trying to help the world do get smarter, happier, and yes, richer. Before we go to the final essay for this essays from yesterday, volume 5, I will reiterate, happy New Year, and good luck to all of us over the next five years. Well, one more trip of the time machine. We don't have to go very far ahead for the final essay. Because six months later, in August of 2010, it was this Rule Breaker's essay, your turn to keep score."", ""A new issue of Rule Breakers arrives in your email inbox or in your snail mail, if you can stand the wait, every month, bringing you two new stock ideas, five best buys now and more.

Well, the first thing I noticed from that essay is that I was celebrating beating the market with stocks that were averaging a 22% gain."", ""Motley Fool Rule Breakers started in October of 2004. We had a number of really good early stocks, we've talked about a few of them this week. But then 2008-09 happened and all so many of our gains got wiped away, but we were still showing positive gains of 22%. By the way, Rule Breakers started two years after Motley Fool Stock Advisor. So Motley Fool Stock Advisor had more time to compound to higher numbers. Anyway, 22% was still ahead of the market. I'm pretty sure the market was negative at that point. Again, we'd started about six years before. It's frustrating to watch the S&P 500 be lower six years after you start investing. It was nice that our average stock was up 22%. Today, having just checked it, the average Motley Fool Rule Breaker stock is up 267%. So yes, things have gotten a lot better over time, and yet, of course, that includes not just all of our winners, but all of our losers too. More than double the S&P 500 across now, more than 400 stocks picked in Motley Fool Stock Advisor. I go strong to the hoop in that particular essay with My Scorecard, and I guess there's a real emphasis again on service. The opening essay this week was about services, not products. It makes an important point, especially if you are in business or an entrepreneur yourself. Having a service mentality versus a product mentality, for me anyway, is a profound reframing for many business people."", ""But anyway, we started with the opening essay on services, not products, and here I was in this essay talking about serving, in this case, a new feature, My Scorecard, which, by the way, has been through a few different iterations over the years. Today, on the Motley Fool site, we have stocks for members, not just ones that you can add to a watch list, but we have them ranked. We have a lot of the Fool 500 quantified and ranked for paying members who can see at any given moment where various stocks are ranking. My brother, Tom Gardner, our CEO, and his team are working really hard, especially here in 2024 now with quants and machine learning to make your experience as a member, I hope, the best it's ever been. My scorecard comes in different forms these days. I especially would like to point you to our app. If you didn't know about this, the Motley Fool has a wonderful premium companion app for paying members. It's right there on the App Store."", 'That\'s another example of how you can track scorecard like your performance. Part of what I was doing that essay is I was hoping people would use the My Scorecard tool, as I mentioned in the essay, in part so we could get better data in terms of who cares about what stock. When you have dozens of stocks under coverage but not dozens and dozens of analysts to cover every single stock, you\'re always left with trying to triage, deciding how best to deploy your talent. At that point, 2010, I was encouraging Rule Breaker members to let us know through My Scorecard what stocks they hold. That way we can start to tell our analysts focus on that stock because people care about that one more than those other stocks which people may not care as much about. Well, these days we don\'t have to do that anymore because we have a lot more members and a lot more site data, both free members and paying members, a member base which generates a lot more data that we can use to make the best decisions we can to serve you in the way that you\'d like to be served, following the stocks that you care most about and especially I know a lot of work is being done at Motley Fool Global Headquarters these days, especially this year, to make every member\'s experience as helpful to you as possible so that you follow these stocks and not those should have a serving up content that is pertinent to you, that is specific to the stocks that you are using. I don\'t think we could ever do that well enough, but we\'re purposing toward doing that better and better to serve you. So yeah, that opening essay about services not products, it\'s putting me in mind of TS Eliot\'s great line, one of those famous lines from his Four Quartets, ""In my beginning is my end.""', ""This is sort of an Alpha and Omega about service for this particular Essays From Yesterday edition. I also want to mention the fun at the end of that essay of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which was a Rule Breaker pick, and Starbucks, which was a Stock Advisor pick, and we were creating some online rivalry. It's some of the hijinks and fun that we've had on our site since we launched on AOL in 1994 right through to 2024 here. Wow, yeah, 30 years later at Fool.com. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, kind of like a quantive, was a big time winner that got bought out. Of course, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was Keurig, which eventually got bought out by a private equity company. In the meantime, Starbucks is another one of those stocks that's been a huge winner for me and many other Motley Fool members."", ""We've held that one for a long time, a multi-bagger. A reminder of the benefits of picking individual stocks, picking stocks with unquantifiable greatness, picking stocks not dipping into stocks, committing to regular savings, regular investment in the best companies of our time. Given that that essay was entitled Your Turn to Keep Score, I can't leave without mentioning the importance, here we are at the start of another investment year, the importance of seeing how you're doing of having a good score card, maybe one of your own design. It could be as simple as a spreadsheet or just noting the opening value of your portfolio as we start 2024 and where it closes at the end of the year. Comparing yourself to market averages that are relevant to you."", ""Keeping score makes us so much better. If we're not keeping score, it's hard to know if we're winning or losing or by how much. Your turn to keep score was the heart of that essay that remains a critical, cardinal Motley Fool point. Well, there it was Essays From Yesterday Volume 5. Four essays, as always full of some, yeah, a few horrendous mistakes, but also some heartwarming and inspiring facts. All of these things happened, I'm sharing them in a fake news world, sometimes I'm sharing with you real stuff here that's happened all the way through, and especially we're having that opportunity together to reflect and take away some lessons from yesterday that we can use this week, this month, this year going forward. From the past then to the present and the future, this week, I will close by thank you for joining with me this week and wishing you again a happy new year and good luck to all of us over the next five years."", ""John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

I\'m going to start here with shares of Paramount. They\'re basically just flat right now, slightly down. That\'s after a ""Wall Street Journal"" report that Skydance Media investors are in talks to gain control of Paramount\'s parent company. If successful, investors would then reportedly try to merge Paramount Global with Skydance.', 'So this one was interesting, in a name we\'ve actually spoken a lot about. And some interesting characters in here as well we have to talk about. So we know Shari Redstone, whose family, obviously they control Paramount Global. She\'s received interest, right, for the movie studio. But I think what\'s different here and this wrinkle is the ""Journal"" is saying that Skydance Media CEO David Ellison is now talking about this all-cash bid for Paramount\'s parent National Amusements.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Right.', '- How will David raise the money? Apparently from Skydance investors. And dad will also apparently help out as well. Dad, in this case, being billionaire Larry Ellison.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Right.', ""- I didn't know about the Ellison-Ellison connection here."", ""- You didn't see the resemblance there, really?"", 'JULIE HYMAN: I mean--', ""- No, you don't see it?"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Now that I look at the picture, yes, I do see it. But what's interesting is that Paramount is obviously very much in play. And it seems like it's up to Shari Redstone, what she wants to do with this. And she doesn't seem in any rush to get it done because we've been talking about it for a couple of months now and what might end up happening with this."", ""It's also interesting to me that Paramount shares-- I think that they moved on this report initially. And we just showed them."", ""- They're not doing much doing."", ""JULIE HYMAN: They're not doing a heck of a lot right now. There you go. You got a little spike on that news. And then they went right back down. So I don't know if that means that the market doesn't think this is likely, that they don't know what to make of the parent company potentially being in play. What would be the implications for Paramount? I think we still have a lot of questions."", ""- And we've had different headlines on this. Too, remember, it was David Zaslav, of course, CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, because we had those reports just last month that he was meeting with Paramount CEO Bob Bakish, discussing the merger too. So a lot of different headlines and reports here."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Well, let's talk about Meta also. I mentioned communication services higher today, in part because of Meta. Mizuho analyst James Lee raising the price target on the tech giant from 400 to 470. He does say, maintain a buy rating. And by the way, just by way of context here, the average price target on the stock is about 385. So he is way above where the Street is on this name."", ""And among other things, what he's looking for here, he likes messaging, which I thought was interesting. He says, messaging is an attractive optionality, and that WhatsApp could incrementally increase Meta's revenue base by a third over time. So that was an interesting part of his thesis about the company."", ""- Yeah, very interesting. You know what I was more interested in today, though, if I'm being totally honest? Zuck posting on Facebook."", 'JULIE HYMAN: About the cows?', ""- Love the cow post. Shared a post on Facebook, says he's now started raising cattle on his Hawaiian ranch on a diet of macadamia meal and beer, all grown and focused on his ranch, by the way. He's keeping it local. And I just love this version of Zuck. It's Hawaii. It's raising cattle. He's challenging Elon Musk to cage fights. It's a brand new guy in charge over there."", ""JULIE HYMAN: I'd really like to know what a drunk cow is like."", ""- Do you get drunk on beer? I don't-- on that-- I don't know."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Of that size--', ""- I don't know."", ""JULIE HYMAN: --an animal that size. And they process food differently. So I don't know, through the stomachs, do they-- does the alcohol even get to them?"", '- And why macadamia meal?', 'JULIE HYMAN: So obviously, would you-- should we be booking an animal husbandry expert now to speak about these issues.', ""- I'd rather be booking a trip to the Hawaiian Zuckerberg estate. This is, I mean really--"", ""JULIE HYMAN: I don't know if that's on the cards for us, Josh."", ""- Aim high, aim high, Julie. Finally, Intuitive Surgical, let's get to this one, last ticker rising higher today after the medical equipment maker reported preliminary revenue for the fourth quarter that topped estimates coming in at 1.93 billion. Street was closer to 1.87 billion. So by the way, Intuitive Surgical hits a 52-week high in today's trade, medical equipment maker. This was preliminary revenue for Q4. But they beat what the Street expected."", 'They are scheduled, by the way, to formally report these results, I guess, on January 23. 19 buys on this, 11 holds, 2 sells, and it sounds like analysts broadly liked what they heard today.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Mm-hmm. Yeah some of the analysts, like Stifel's Rick Weiss saying, if you go back to 2015, the company's initial procedure growth guidance range has actually been conservative. So you're looking at this forecast today. The Street likes it. But even some on the Street view it as low and that they could come in and beat here. I mean, so another thing to point out here is that Intuitive Surgical is really kind of a pioneer in the surgical robot business."", ""And so analysts like those over at Leerink are saying that basically, the fact that it has been first to market creates high potential switching costs for hospitals. In other words, if you've got the Intuitive Surgical, if you've got their Da Vinci robots, then it's difficult to switch away from that system to something else."", ""- Well, it's one to watch, certainly."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, most definitely. It was up 27% last year. And that 52-week high that you mentioned, I don't think it's quite a record high, if I'm not mistaken. But it has done well, certainly, over the past year.""]"

Still, many such plays remain a country mile away from their peak levels. Though the 2023 summer season saw glimmers of hope for discretionary travel, questions linger as to what’s in store for 2024.', 'Undoubtedly, a potential economic downturn could curb the appetite for travel and leisure. But the million-dollar question remains: just how much-anticipated weakness is already baked into the share prices of travel and leisure bets with newfound momentum?', 'Looking at Wall Street, analysts think the top plays in travel still have room for upside. Indeed, it would be nice if the bout of travel strength experienced last summer is more than just a short-lived glimmer. Therefore, let’s tune into TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to have a look at three Strong-Buy-rated travel names — RCL, WH, and LVS — that still have a decent amount of upside for the year ahead.', 'At the start of 2023, few folks would have thought that Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines would be flirting with pre-pandemic highs again. The cruise line industry was a wreck that struggled to climb out of the hole that the pandemic kicked it into. Fast forward to today, and RCL stock goes for around $123, 9% away from its January 2020 all-time high.', 'Helping fuel last year’s incredible surge has been an impressive pick-up in bookings. For 2024, numerous analysts don’t expect booking demand to reverse course suddenly. If anything, booking strength could beget more strength even in the face of this year’s economic unknowns. So, just like the analyst community, I’m staying bullish on RCL stock as it looks for a long-awaited breakout.', 'Indeed, the cruise lines received a one-two punch to the chin during COVID lockdowns, as fuel prices soared while demand plummeted. With the “accelerating demand environment” (quoting the company) and the potential relief in fuel prices in 2024, it may be tough to stop the well-run cruise line as it looks to sail even higher.', 'CEO Jason Liberty also highlighted the “strength” of his firm’s brands as a contributor behind the firm’s latest quarterly earnings blowout. Indeed, Royal Caribbean is definitely known to be one of the more luxurious cruisers on the scene, and its premium nature is likely why it’s been leaving its peers at the port.', 'Royal Caribbean stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 11 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average RCL stock price target\xa0of $136.27 implies 10.3% upside potential.', 'Wyndham Hotels & Resorts stock is up 15% over the past year but still down around 14% from its late 2021 all-time high, near $94 per share. To close off a decent 2023, competitor Choice Hotels (NYSE:CHH) started its hostile takeover bid for Wyndham. Management rejected the offer, but Choice is moving forward with regulatory proceedings. Indeed, the matter will make for a rather eventful 2024.', 'In any case, I believe Choice’s interest shines a bright light on the value to be had in the mid-cap ($6.7 billion market cap) firm behind budget hotel chains such as Travelodge, Super 8, and Ramada. More affordable hotels and motels could be key to traveling on a tight budget as the threat of recession looms around the corner. As WH stock looks to continue its share price recovery in 2024, I can’t help but be bullish, especially at today’s modest valuations.', 'At writing, shares of WH trade at 19.5 times forward price-to-earnings, well below the lodging industry average of 23.57. The discount to rivals, I believe, is unwarranted, given that Wyndham’s brands have been resonating with travelers.', 'Wyndham stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with seven unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average WH stock price target\xa0of $90.00 implies 11.1% upside potential.', 'Despite the name, Las Vegas Sands is a casino and resort that’s a play on Macau, China’s gambling hotspot. Given how horrid the Chinese economy has been, it’s not a mystery to see shares of LVS in the gutter.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.33 per share, indicating a change of +6.9% from the year-ago quarter.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.2%.

And, when it comes to investing in their first home, they may find the best luck in some unexpected places. In its most recent report, Realtor.com® unveiled the Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers in 2024. This year's ranking includes Irondequoit, N.Y.; Benton, Ark.; Winterset, Iowa; Newington, Conn.; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Cheektowaga, N.Y.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Moore, Okla.; Mattydale, N.Y. and Riviera Beach, Md."", '""Buying a first home can be a daunting task. Couple high interest rates with historically low inventory of homes available for sale in 2023 and hopeful buyers have faced a particularly challenging market,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist, Realtor.com®. ""While affordability will remain an issue in 2024, a recent Realtor.com® survey showed that 95% of prospective first-time homebuyers overwhelmingly feel that they\'ll be able to afford a home within their lifetime, with 40% saying they\'ll be able to afford it within the next year.""', 'The Realtor.com® analysis of Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers uncovers a collection of small to mid-size towns and cities that are hidden gems of opportunity where affordability meets healthy inventory, culture and liveliness, lower than average commute times, forecasted price growth, and good company of similar-aged peers.', ""Affordability\xa0- As one of the biggest purchases consumers will make in their lives, affordability is a major decision driver. In its analysis, Realtor.com® looked at listing prices compared to gross household incomes of 25- to 34-year-olds in a city for the past 12 months to understand home affordability. A lower ratio indicates a more affordable place to live. The top markets in this year's list had an average 2023 listing price to income ratio of 3.1 compared to the national rate of 5.4. Additionally, homes in these towns/cities had an average median listing price that is 42% lower than the national median of $382,000. Within the top 10 list, Mattydale, N.Y., was the most affordable market relative to local incomes for 25–34-year-olds."", ""Investing in growth - Buying a home is not only a large investment up front, it's a commitment for the duration of ownership, which means investing in the ongoing upkeep and maintenance of the home. Naturally, first-time home buyers are looking for homes that fit everything they want, but also provide opportunities for their investment to grow. The top markets are located within metro areas that have an average forecasted 2024 home price growth rate of 6.1%, which is considerably higher than the national expected decline of -1.7%. Irondequoit, N.Y., is located in the metro area with the highest expected median sale price growth rate (10.4%)."", 'Options to buy - At a time marked by chronically low inventory levels, the top markets had an average count of 40.2 active listings per 1,000 existing households in 2023, and one area in particular, Riviera Beach, Md., had the most active listings per household (59.3 per 1,000) across the list of top 10.', ""Things to do\xa0- It's not only about the house but what surrounds it, and first-time buyers are keen on finding areas that have plenty of things to do. The top places on this year's list have great options for restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping, and entertainment businesses such as theaters, comedy clubs, and arts classes per point of interest data provided by Yelp. As a group, the top cities and towns have 16.6 of these businesses per 1,000 households, slightly higher than the overall city/town average of 15.6. However, Cheektowaga, N.Y.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Newington, Conn. particularly shine, with a ratio higher than 19 per 1,000 households."", ""Shorter commutes -\xa0The time it takes getting to and from work is a major consideration for home buyers, especially as return to office becomes more prevalent. With an average expected 2024 commute time of 24 minutes for the top cities on this year's list, they clock in at less than the city/town average of 30 minutes and the national rate of 29 minutes – saving commuters about 50 hours per year for a 5-day commuter. Mattydale, N.Y., has the lowest average commute time to work, at 20 minutes."", ""Youthful towns - Along with having things to do, first-time buyers may want to be close to people in similar life stages and around the same ages. The share of homeowners between the ages of 25 and 34 in this year's top markets is 8.1%, well above the national average of 5.4%. Among the top 10 cities and towns, Riviera Beach,\xa0Md., is expected to have the largest share of young adult homeowners (10.9%), which may prove to be a hot spot for the next generation of first-time home buyers."", 'Realtor.com® Best Markets for First-Time Homebuyers Ranked', 'Rank', 'Place Name', 'Metro Name', 'Region', '2024 Forecasted 25-34 Homeowner Share of Households', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Inventory', 'per 1000 Household', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Median Listing Price', '12 Month Ending November 2023 Price to Income Ratio', '2024 Forecasted Average Travel Time to Work (Minutes)', 'November 2023 Yelp Culture and Lifestyle Businesses per 1000 Households', '1', 'Irondequoit, NY', 'Rochester, NY', 'Northeast', '8.2\xa0%', '34.1', '$187,000', '2.5', '22', '14.9', '2', 'Benton, AR', 'Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR', 'South', '7.6\xa0%', '50.2', '$197,500', '3.0', '25', '17.9', '3', 'Winterset, IA', 'Des Moines-West Des Moines, IA', 'Midwest', '7.3\xa0%', '47.8', '$269,400', '4.0', '23', '18.0', '4', 'Newington, CT', 'Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT', 'Northeast', '6.6\xa0%', '37.8', '$290,294', '3.4', '23', '19.2', '5', 'Council Bluffs, IA', 'Omaha-Council Bluffs, NE-IA', 'Midwest', '6.4\xa0%', '37.6', '$200,000', '3.0', '21', '13.0', '6', 'Cheektowaga, NY', 'Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, NY', 'Northeast', '7.2\xa0%', '26.6', '$199,000', '3.1', '21', '22.6', '7', 'Grand Rapids, MI', 'Grand Rapids-Wyoming, MI', 'Midwest', '9.5\xa0%', '33.1', '$260,000', '4.3', '21', '20.0', '8', 'Moore, OK', 'Oklahoma City, OK', 'South', '9.7\xa0%', '43.6', '$231,475', '3.2', '26', '14.1', '9', 'Mattydale, NY', 'Syracuse, NY', 'Northeast', '7.4\xa0%', '31.6', '$138,450', '2.0', '20', '9.2', '10', 'Riviera Beach, MD', 'Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD', 'South', '10.9\xa0%', '59.3', '$264,079', '2.7', '33', '16.7', '', 'USA', '', '', '5.4\xa0%', '38.6', '$382,230', '5.4', '29', '', '\xa0', 'Complete details of\xa0the report can be found on Realtor.com®, along with a First-Time Home Buyers Resource Center, multiple guides on mortgages and tools like a RealCost™\xa0Buying Power Tool\xa0to help prospective buyers understand how much house they can afford.', ""MethodologyThis year, the candidate list of places was filtered to only expose areas with an expected 2024 population of at least 5,000.

Demand was insatiable. AI chip sales -- logged under its ""Data Center"" segment -- soared from $3.6 billion in Q4 fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 2023) to $14.5 billion nine months later in Q3 fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 2023).', ""Based on management's guidance, revenue for full-year fiscal 2024 (ending in Jan. 2024) will come in at roughly $59 billion, a massive increase from $27 billion in the year prior. However, it's a meager amount for a company that currently touts a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion. How expensive is Nvidia stock as 2024 gets underway?"", 'There is quite the disconnect between Nvidia\'s revenue and that of the other few companies that have surpassed the $1 trillion market cap milestone (all of which are part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven""). Even assuming Nvidia has already reported full-year results and has achieved the $59 billion in sales it\'s forecasting, it\'s still a very distant fourth place behind the other tech giants with a $1 trillion market cap.', ""To understand why Nvidia is getting a pass for this very rich valuation, remember that it's in the driver's seat of a massive new secular growth trend: the buildout of AI and general-purpose accelerated computing infrastructure, primarily in data centers."", ""It's currently estimated that the world's existing data centers (both for public cloud and for private business use) are worth about $1 trillion. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as well as others inside and outside the semiconductor industry, have stated a belief that new data centers powered by accelerated computing (Nvidia's longtime specialty) are rapidly being built to either replace or augment that existing $1 trillion market."", ""That data center computing infrastructure needs to be replaced every five years or so (equating to about $200 billion in annual spending), plus or minus a year or two depending on usage, technology upgrade trends, economic conditions, and so on. And as we're early on in this upgrade cycle fueled by AI, there's a belief among some on Wall Street that data center upgrades will continue at a rapid pace in 2024 and push that total global data center value far beyond $1 trillion. Even Huang and the top team at Nvidia have stated an expectation that data center revenue will continue to rise sequentially throughout 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Nvidia), driven by more AI use cases."", 'In addition to AI, Nvidia also provides ample amounts of equipment to traditional data center operators. And let\'s not forget the company\'s other sales segments, two of which (""Gaming"" and ""Professional Visualization"") could catch a strong tailwind as the PC market downturn of the last year-plus has bottomed and is showing signs of life again. Together, these two PC-oriented segments could generate significant sales this year (Gaming and Professional Visualization hauled in $8.7 billion during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, and neither were in top form).', 'All told, this is what Wall Street analysts are thinking about when they give Nvidia a consensus revenue estimate of over $90 billion for fiscal 2025. And with the general conclusion that there will be plenty more accelerated computing market expansion over the next five to 10 years, it explains why Nvidia fetches a significant premium.', 'There\'s another important reason investors are giving the stock a pass on its rich valuation: profit potential. The company is the world\'s most valuable semiconductor business, but there\'s far more going on these days. Huang has helped direct Nvidia into a ""full-stack computing"" business, running the gamut from hardware design to software development and subscription sales.', ""In fact, of those companies with a $1 trillion-plus value, Nvidia currently cranks out more cash as a percentage of total sales than even software giant Microsoft (software tends to generate higher margins than hardware). Granted, Nvidia's historically hardware-based sales and profitability are far more cyclical than Microsoft's, but Nvidia's profit potential is nevertheless impressive."", 'Few semiconductor companies even come close to matching Nvidia in this department. AMD and Intel, both of which many investors hope can make some AI hay of their own even though they lag far behind in the software department, pale in comparison when it comes to operating margin and free cash flow generation.', ""Based on its explosive growth and high rates of profitability, Nvidia stock trades for about 26 times one-year-forward expected earnings as of this writing. By comparison, the S&P 500 index trades for about 21 to 22 times expected earnings. Perhaps Nvidia stock isn't as expensive as it appears."", 'Of course, investors should also consider that at some point, a downturn will come for the accelerated computing market -- just as such cyclical downturns tend to crop up every few years for other enterprise computing markets, PCs, and smartphones. Perhaps by the end of 2024 it will become apparent if such a downturn is imminent.', ""Either way, that's a big reason to be prudent with Nvidia stock right now, even though the valuation may look somewhat reasonable based on full calendar year 2024 earnings estimates. Beyond this growth cycle, though, and looking at Nvidia's evolution into a full-blown tech giant and software platform, there are plenty of reasons to like the stock for the long term. This is a top-notch semiconductor and AI software business to invest in for 2024, assuming your investment time horizon accounts for inevitable bumps down the road."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Stirring ""AI"" and ""Blockchain"" together into a buzzword stew to help build ""trust in news"" feels like great press fodder, especially if you\'re an aging media conglomerate with credibility issues. We\'ve all seen Succession, haven\'t we?', ""But let's set the irony aside for a moment and take Fox and its new tool seriously. On the deep-fake end, Fox says people can load URLs and images into the Verify system to determine if they're authentic, meaning a publisher has added them to the Verify database. On the licensing end, AI companies can use the Verify database to access (and pay for) content in a compliant way."", ""Blockchain Creative Labs, Fox's in-house technology arm, partnered with Polygon, the low-fee, high-throughput blockchain that works atop the sprawling Ethereum network, to power things behind the scenes. Adding new content to Verify essentially means adding an entry to a database on the Polygon blockchain, where its metadata and other information are stored."", ""Unlike so many other crypto experiments, the blockchain tie-in might have a point this time around: Polygon gives content on Verify an immutable audit trail, and it ensures that third-party publishers don't need to trust Fox to steward their data."", ""Verify in its current state feels a bit like a glorified database checker, a simple web app that uses Polygon's tech to keep track of images and URLs. But that doesn't mean it's useless – particularly when it comes to helping legacy publishers navigate licensing deals in the world of large language models."", ""We went ahead and uploaded some content into Verify's web app to see how well it works in day-to-day use, and it didn't take us long to notice the app's limitations for the consumer use case."", 'The Verify app has a text input box for URLs. When we pasted in a Fox News article from Tuesday about Elon Musk and deep fakes (which happened to be featured prominently on the site) and pressed ""enter,"" a bunch of information popped up attesting to the article\'s provenance. Along with a transaction hash and signature – data for the Polygon blockchain transaction representing the piece of content – the Verify app also showed the article\'s associated metadata, licensing information, and a set of images that appear in the content.', '', 'We then downloaded and re-uploaded one of those images into the tool to see if it could be verified. When we did, we were shown similar data to what we saw when we inputted the URL. (When we tried another image, we could also click on a link to see other Fox articles that the image had been used in. Cool!)', 'While Verify accomplished these simple tasks as advertised, it\'s hard to imagine many people will need to ""verify"" the source of content that they lifted directly from the Fox News website.', 'In its documentation, Verify suggests that a possible user of the service might be a person who comes across an article on social media and wants to figure out whether it is from a putative source. When we ran Verify through this real-world scenario, we ran into issues.', ""We found an official Fox News post on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter) featuring the same article that we verified originally, and we then uploaded X's version of the article's URL into Verify. Even though clicking on the X link lands one directly onto the same Fox News page that we checked originally – and Verify was able to pull up a preview of the article – Verify wasn't able to tell us if the article was authentic this time around."", ""Mark Ruffalo blasts Musk's X for allowing 'disinformation' after sharing AI fakes of Trump on Epstein flight https://t.co/oxVxwyhuPD"", '— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 10, 2024', ""We then screen-grabbed the thumbnail image from the Fox News post: one of the same Fox images that we uploaded last time around. This time, we were told that the image couldn't be authenticated. It turns out that if an image is manipulated in any way – which includes slightly-cropped thumbnails, or screenshots whose dimensions aren't exactly right – the Verify app will get confused."", 'Some of these technical shortcomings will surely be ironed out, but there are even more complicated engineering problems that Fox will need to contend with if it hopes to help consumers suss out AI-generated content.', ""Even when Verify is working as advertised, it can't tell you whether the content was AI-generated – only that it came from Fox (or from whatever other source uploaded it, presuming other publishers use Verify in the future). If the goal is to help consumers discern AI-generated content from human content, this doesn't help. Even trusted news outlets like Sports Illustrated have become embroiled in controversy for using AI-generated content."", ""Then there's the problem of user apathy. People tend not to care so much about whether what they're reading is true, as Fox is surely aware. This is especially true when people want something to be true."", ""For something like Verify to be useful for consumers, one imagines it'll need to be built directly into the tools that people use to view content, like web browsers and social media platforms. You could imagine a sort of badge, à la community notes, that shows up on content that's been added to the Verify database."", ""It feels unfair to rag on this barebones version of Verify given that Fox was quite proactive in labeling it as beta. Fox also isn't only focused on general media consumers, as we have been in our testing."", 'Fox\'s partner, Polygon, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk that ""Verify establishes a technical bridge between media companies and AI platforms"" and has additional features to help create ""new commercial opportunities for content owners by utilizing smart contracts to set programmatic conditions for access to content.""', 'While the specifics here are somewhat vague, the idea seems to be that Verify will serve as a sort of global database for AI platforms that scrape the web for news content – providing a way for AI platforms to glean authenticity and for publishers to gate their content behind licensing restrictions and paywalls.', 'Verify would probably need buy-in from a critical mass of publishers and AI companies for this sort of thing to work; for now, the database just includes around 90,000 articles from Fox-owned publishers including Fox News and Fox Sports. The company also says it has opened the door for other publishers to add content to the Verify database, and it has also open-sourced its code to those who want to create new platforms based on its tech.', 'Even in its current state, the licensing use case for Verify seems like a solid idea – particularly in light of the thorny legal questions that publishers and AI companies are currently reckoning with.', 'In a recently filed lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, the New York Times has alleged its content was used without permission to train AI models. Verify could provide a standard framework for AI companies to access online content, thereby giving news publishers something of an upper hand in their negotiations with AI companies.']"

And if you believe that Fox should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, Fox’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

What was once an index dominated by a dozen industrial companies in the late 19th century has evolved into a 30-component index comprised of diverse, time-tested, multinational businesses."", 'Although the share-price-weighted Dow Jones managed to climb to a fresh all-time high in late 2023, the outlook for its 30 components varies quite a bit in the new year. Whereas two Dow stocks stand out as phenomenal buys in 2024, another long-tenured component can be easily passed up by investors.', ""The first no-brainer Dow Jones stock that's begging to be bought in the new year is media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS)."", 'There\'s no sugarcoating the fact that Walt Disney has faced a flurry of headwinds over the past couple of years. The COVID-19 pandemic severely hampered its theme-park operations and film entertainment division. Meanwhile, large operating losses from the company\'s streaming services segment, coupled with weaker ad spending, has led to a challenging environment for the ""House of Mouse."" However, many of these gray clouds should clear in 2024, paving the way for a rebound in Disney stock.', 'In December 2022, China ended its controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy, which involved stringent and unpredictable lockdowns. With China\'s economy still ramping up following years of lockdowns, Walt Disney has seen its theme-park sales growth return to normal. The further we move past the worst of the pandemic, the easier it\'ll be for investors to recognize that Disney\'s organic growth machine is back on track.', ""One of the key factors that powers Walt Disney's revenue and profit growth is its phenomenal pricing power. For instance, the admission price to Disneyland in Southern California has risen by more than 10,000% since the park opened in 1955. This is about 10 times higher than the aggregate rate of inflation for the U.S. economy over the same period."", ""Walt Disney's incredible pricing power is a reflection of the irreplaceability of its characters, storytelling, and engagement. There are plenty of other theme parks to attend and movies to watch, but no other media company has the ability to cross generational gaps with ease to allow grandparents and grandchildren to find common ground through imagination. This competitive advantage that Disney brings to the table is priceless."", ""Another reason to be excited about Walt Disney's prospects in 2024 is the expected operating improvement of its streaming segment. The company hasn't been shy about increasing subscription prices across most tiers."", ""Since Disney+ subscribers tend to be loyal to the brand, it's seen only minimal subscriber attrition as it's increased prices. When combined with mindful cost-cutting, Disney's streaming segment is capable of delivering a profit by the end of the current fiscal year (Disney's fiscal year usually ends in late September)."", 'Walt Disney shares can be scooped up right now for 17 times forward-year earnings, which remains a bargain, considering its expected annualized earnings growth rate of 17% over the next five years.', 'The second Dow stock that investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as ""J&J.""', 'While the Dow Jones Industrial Average was setting new highs in 2023, J&J was weighing it down. The reason for its underperformance over the past year has to do with outstanding litigation concerning its now-discontinued talc-based baby powder.', 'Johnson & Johnson attempted to settle the matter on two occasions last year, with the latest settlement totaling $8.9 billion. However, both attempts were eventually thrown out in court. The unknowns surrounding any financial liability for J&J clearly are holding down its shares.', ""The flip side to the above headwind is that Johnson & Johnson is one of only two publicly traded companies to sport a AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of the more-familiar S&P Global. This credit rating, which is a notch higher than the AA-credit rating bestowed on the U.S. government, signifies S&P's utmost faith that J&J can service and repay its outstanding debts."", ""J&J has more than $23 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of Oct. 1, 2023. It's also raking in north of $20 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Therefore, there's little worry about the company's potential financial liability."", ""What makes Johnson & Johnson such a screaming buy is its ongoing shift to pharmaceuticals. For more than a decade, the company has been laser-focused on expanding its novel-drug portfolio. Even though brand-name drugs have finite periods of sales exclusivity, they provide J&J with juicy margins and strong pricing power. Aggressively investing in novel research and collaborations has the company's profit needle pointing decisively higher."", ""As I've previously pointed out, continuity at key leadership positions is also important. You can count on two hands how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Minimal turnover at the top means strategic initiatives are being successfully implemented over long periods."", 'Finally, the price is right with Johnson & Johnson. Opportunistic long-term investors can scoop up shares of J&J for about 15 times forward-year earnings. This represents its lowest forward-year earnings multiple in at least a decade.', 'On the other hand, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense contractor Boeing (NYSE: BA) has given investors every reason to steer clear of its stock in 2024.', ""On paper, Boeing has a pretty clear runway for growth. Production of the 737 MAX is forecast to expand from a current 38 aircraft per month to 50 per month by 2026. Increasing production should lift the company's operating cash flow and give it an opportunity to meaningfully chisel away at its outstanding debt."", 'Furthermore, the price of oil remains elevated due to tight global supply. The longer energy commodity costs remain above historic norms, the more likely commercial airlines are to upgrade their fleets to more fuel-efficient jetliners.', 'Over the next five to 10 years, Boeing could deliver handsomely for its shareholders. But in 2024, it has the potential to be a disaster.', ""Boeing is receiving a lot of attention at the moment due to an incident that occurred this past weekend involving a 737 MAX 9 jetliner that had a section of its fuselage rip off from the plane during flight. This incident, by itself, and the subsequent grounding of other 737 MAX 9 jetliners, isn't why I'd avoid Boeing stock in 2024. However, it's one of a number of instances of Boeing's next-generation aircraft running into production/quality issues. These persistent problems have slowed the production ramp up of Boeing next-gen jetliners and given investors little reason to expect a turnaround in the short term."", ""Boeing's missteps can also be tangibly seen in Wall Street's consensus earnings forecast for the company. At this time last year, Wall Street had been expecting north of $2 in earnings per share (EPS) for 2023. When Boeing reports its fourth-quarter operating results, expectations are that it'll close out 2023 with a full-year loss of greater than $6 per share. That's effectively a $5 billion swing lower in the company's bottom line -- yet shares of Boeing are up over the trailing year."", ""Another reason to avoid Boeing in the current year is its performance during recessions. Though U.S. unemployment data isn't indicative of a recession, a couple of money-based metrics and forecasting tools strongly suggest a deflationary downturn for the U.S. economy is around the corner. Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during the past five recessions."", ""In a stock-picker's market, where valuation matters, buying shares of Boeing at 57 times forward-year earnings doesn't make sense."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

At least three other activists are setting the stage for a proxy battle ahead of the media giant's upcoming annual shareholder meeting."", ""It's not a surprise that Disney is in the crosshairs. The stock has fallen well short of the market in each of the last three years, shedding more than half of its value since its early 2021 peak. The return of a popular CEO halfway through the slump hasn't helped turn the bearish sentiment around. It doesn't mean that things will get messy, even if the hourglass sand is starting to thin out heading into the springtime showdown."", ""Disney is generating record revenue right now, but it doesn't mean that it's at its best. Profitability is well below its fiscal 2018 peak. It's struggling to grow its flagship media networks and iconic studios businesses. Its ascending streaming business is drawn to red like a bull."", ""The good news for Disney is that the catalysts are there for all to see. After failing to crank out one of last year's top theatrical releases, Disney has at least three films on the slate that could break its drought of putting out a film topping $1 billion in global box office receipts. CEO Bob Iger continues to expect Disney+ to turn profitable by the end of this fiscal year. Cord-cutting will continue to weigh on the growth prospects of its media networks segment, but a steady economy and the resolution of last year's content-related strikes will be fertile soil for a recovery in the TV advertising market."", 'The bad news is that none of these potentially bullish catalysts will be resolved in time for the annual shareholder meeting. A date hasn\'t been announced, but with Disney\'s fiscal 2023 year ending in September the event has typically happened in March or April. Disney has just one more earnings report to fire off in the chamber. It\'s all ""trust me"" after that.', ""Disney is going on the offensive. It's probably not a coincidence that it just resumed its dividend distributions, signaling that it's ready to party like it's 2019. When it delivers its fiscal first-quarter results next month it should show another period of strength at its theme parks and improving results for its streaming business."", ""Don't underestimate the power of Iger to sell the recovery to his shareholders, and not just because the board extended his contract by another two years this past summer. Former helmsman Bob Chapek was also extended by the boardroom before being let go a few months later. The difference here is that Iger was successful in his previous tenure as Disney CEO."", ""Iger will listen to what the activists have to say. He may even agree to some of the suggestions that don't involve upending his board with new activist faces. Disney is an entertainment behemoth with so many moving parts, and institutional and retail investors alike may side with the stability they know in Iger and his vision for near-term improvement.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool analyst, Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me for the first time in 2024."", 'Asit Sharma: Dylan, so great to be with you and start the new year together.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got some updates on Tesla's delivery numbers, a stock to watch in 2024 as well, but we are going to kick off our new year as shows go with a curious piece of news. January 1st marked the beginning of a lot of things, and in Disney's case, in particular Asit, it marked the end of their copyright on Steamboat Willie. If that is not a name that you recognize, maybe you'll recognize Disney's Mickey and Minnie Mouse characters which make their appearance there in their first forms. Now, because this copyright is expiring Asit, now anyone can make use of that character. It is not the fully fledged white glove Mickey Mouse character we all know, but it seems like a bit of a blow to the magical kingdom."", ""Asit Sharma: Totally Dylan. Copyright law in the US has really evolved over the last century. It now strikes a great balance, I think, between protecting the original artist's right to earn and just be compensated for his or her creativity and the public's need to further creative exercises and be able to use ideas and art forms of expression and take them one step further. Now, we should mention here that Disney, the company which we all have known since childhood, has been a major proponent of extending copyright for decades. They were critical in the Copyright Act of 1976, and Dylan, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 is actually popularly nicknamed the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. But alas, after 95 years, here comes the day, and this is a ritual every January 1, some copyright expires on different characters. Here we have this early version of Mickey Mouse available for you and I to go out and make something of it."", ""Dylan Lewis: As you might expect, the Internet is absolutely undefeated as always. There are already a ton of projects out there incorporating this character, including Mickey's Mouse Trap, a slasher horror movie which incorporates the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse. I think this is an interesting, it's a little bit of a silly topic, but it's an interesting one because we so often think about copyrights, trademarks as part of this very impenetrable mote that companies have. We don't really run into IP rolling off all that often for these really famous characters. Disney has tried to delay this as long as possible. Asit when you see this news and you start seeing some of these off brand Mickey type things coming out there, what do you think about this with respect to Disney's brand?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think that it has a limited impact on Disney's brand. In fact, it's always good to get a push like this to extend your own IP universe a bit further. The original Steamboat Willie, it's a short. You can watch this. The characters of Mickey and Minnie Mouse are interesting. Mickey is a really rough edged rogue type character compared to the Mickey Mouse that we all know today as it evolved over time. I think Disney has become a little bit protective of that image and doesn't take as much risk with the character of Mickey Mouse anymore. So it's good to see this early version roll off and let the Internet, and by the Internet, Dylan, you and I include AI generated ideas come into play, let them do what they will. Some of that none of us are going to waste time watching, but some of this stuff will get passed around as memes that we'll laugh at. I think it's actually good for the creative process and to keep a big company like Disney on its toes and realize that you have to keep creating that IP. You can't rest on your laurels in business. This is the way things should be."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit, let's switch over from the House of Mouse to the king of EVs. We got an update on the latest delivery numbers from Tesla, and with 1.8 million deliveries in 2023, Tesla remains at the top of the charts for EVs. Not all that surprising given the lead that it had, but I think a strong sign of where it is, especially with respect to the US market."", ""Asit Sharma: Dylan, let's do our ritual removal here of Elon musk from the conversation or we'll spend so much time just talking about Musk and his personality. Let's talk about Tesla, the company. I think this shows a lot of good things for Tesla. One, nice execution in being able to exceed what I think was a consensus estimate of something like 477,000 deliveries in the last quarter of the year. And as you point out, I mean within the year of 2023, they certainly were king. I think this is further evidence of supply chain straightening out. You can't produce and deliver the vehicles if you can't get the components and raw materials coming in. It's also a relationship of several parts of Tesla's business strategy. You've got the incentives piece, so Tesla has been discounting models then retracting some of those discounts. They've been leaning heavily into price promotions. They started advertising a bit, which they were reluctant to do before. The culture at Tesla, which is to do everything to make those deliveries, the extension of production from what was years ago, just the US, into Germany, China, Mexico product plant. That plant is coming up. Maybe it'll be built in a couple of years. When you put this whole puzzle together, you see a company that's become really formidable at meeting its delivery targets. That's maybe not a competitive mode, but it's a sustainable edge. We've seen other big automakers like Ford, GM, Toyota, Volvo, Mercedes all back off of their big talk from just two years ago. They are still investing very heavily in the EV space, but almost to the last of these companies I've mentioned has pulled back a little bit in their planning and extended out their times to move from their current production states to EV production states. Why is that? This stuff is hard. So Tesla still has an edge. Say what you will about the company, its margins, its prospects, Elon Musk. This is evidence on the ground that you shouldn't count Tesla out just yet."", ""Dylan Lewis: You ran through a couple of who's who of the American car makers there. Certainly in our home market here in the United States, it is Tesla by a mile. But if you broaden out the scope and you look at a bit more globally at EVs, it seems like the competition is starting to creep up there, at least as we look at deliveries. China's BYD came in second for 2023. They had roughly 1.6 million EVs sold, but second place in 2023, they were ahead of Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2023 in deliveries. Now, we don't have BYD cars out here on the roads. They are not really for sale in the United States. But how do you process another upstart EV maker starting to catch up to Tesla and nip at its heels."", ""Asit Sharma: Amazing story. This is a company that has a lot of manufacturing prowess. They remind me of Tesla in so many ways. But there are a couple of parts of this story which maybe should be a caution against just assuming that BYD is going to leap frog Tesla and every other EV maker on the planet. First, the Chinese government has like one major bright spot in their economic picture, which right now looks so bleak for so many reasons. We've discussed those on Motley Fool Money over the last year or so. But just drive to electrify the vehicle landscape in China is something the government is going to continue to put money in. But we should note, they've rolled back most of the incentives for both the production side and the buyer side. The Chinese still enjoy some tax breaks on consumption, tax on the bio electric vehicles, but the major vehicle subsidies on the consumer side are being phased out by the Chinese government and most of them have lapsed. You're going to see less of the subsidy piece push vehicle sales in China. But BYD pulled the Tesla last year. They started promoting on price, working with price points, and they also sell a cheaper vehicle than Tesla does."", ""Their top selling models are actually more entry level vehicles, and that's what's allowed them to pump the volume numbers up. Now, how does BYD keep competing with China? It's got to expand out of China. But here you have both in the EU and the US, a lot of regulatory skepticism after seeing what happened with the semiconductor landscape, the solar landscape over the last few decades. In the context of this trade war and geopolitical power match between the US, the EU, and China, I think it's going to be harder for Chinese vehicles to really penetrate these markets. The Chinese EV Power Group, so this is BYD Neo some other auto manufacturers only hold 8% share in the EU just now. The EU is actively investigating the subsidy piece of the Chinese market to see if that's unfair competition in China. I think we have to admire what BYD has achieved, but not assume that it's suddenly going to be the super brand that takes over the planet."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit as we mentioned at the top of the show, it is both of our first times on the air in 2024. The beginning of the year is not just when we see copyright protections roll off. It's also that magic time of the year when people are particularly excited for new stock ideas. What's a company that you're paying attention to and interested in in 2024?"", ""Asit Sharma: I'm excited to talk about this company, not just because I'm enthusiastic about its prospects over five years, but I understand that you are a user of its products. Maybe you can give me some feedback on my thesis here. But I want to talk about a consumer facing company called Sonos, which I think most members have probably heard of. They make audio equipment, that is, I would call it up market, I wouldn't call it super high end, but it certainly is a premium product. Sonos hit a wall in late 2022, and throughout 2023 because they are a preferred audio component of choice for home installers, those who are dependent on that home market expanding. The company also has a pretty good retail presence as well, but sales have been flattish as interest rates have spiked and the pace of new homes being built has slowed down. The company is now looking to introduce the next wave of its multi-year product cycle in 2024. They have promised entry into a multi billion dollar market in the second half of 2024, which management says should bring about instant additional revenue."", ""The stock is trading at around 12 times its next 12 months free cash flow. It's cheap if sales pick up, if earnings pick up. This market is widely acknowledged to be the headphone market. On one hand, I think Sonos has demonstrated that they have really great products. They have repeat buyers in spades. The company is able to raise its price points over time, but I wonder about this, Dylan, and here's where I'd love your advice. The headphone market is really filled with great players, from Apple to Bows, to Sonos, to Bows and Wilkins. Even though this is pretty high quality stuff, the question in my mind is, is Sonos going to be able to find its niche? Or will it discover that this is a pretty tough place to play, even though it is a very respected brand among audio files.? Tell me about your experience, Dylan, and crush my thesis, please."", ""Dylan Lewis: Well, I was going to say, you're dead on there. I'm a customer and this company for a long time has lived in the space of, for me, great product. I'm not 100% sure on the business. The reason for that is they are a little bit of a specialist and they are in a market that I worry sometimes big tech will continue to creep into. Or that allegiances to certain ecosystems like apple may eat into the customer opportunity for them. But just from my own perspective as a user, I really like the sound quality, you're right. They're a little bit up market for people that want something that is Bluetooth or wireless in their homes for the true true audio files, maybe not the market. I do wonder though if they are looking to get into headphones and that kinds of things. If there is a real opportunity for them, or particularly in the United States where we see iPhone and IOS adoption so high people may go for more seamless integrated products like Apple's Airpods that play into an ecosystem they're already a part of. I'm someone who has airpods and a Sonos, so I am living that reality right now. I would say I am a big bull on the home market for them. I have some big questions when it comes to the wireless market and the headphone market."", ""Asit Sharma: That's such a great analysis. I'm looking at this as potentially an interesting company for a five-year hold. I think over time that brand power will continue to manifest. But you're so right, Dylan, Sonos has run into issues with Google. They have sued Alphabet a few years ago because they claim that Google was infringing with its own speakers on their technology. They're up against very robust competition with huge balance sheets, and they're a small niche player, two billion buck players. Maybe we can revisit this company I'm interested in a little later this year. Maybe in the summer after they release these new products, we'll see where they stand."", ""Dylan Lewis: I love it. In the meantime, I'll just be catching you on the episodes that I don't host on my Sonos here at home Asit."", 'Asit Sharma: Awesome. Thanks man.', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got more stock talk ahead.

Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard caught up with Motley Fool analyst [inaudible] for a look at some recent winners that could keep winning in 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley Fool analyst Kirsten Guerra and we're going to talk about some of the ways to consider winners in your portfolio. Kirsten, how are you doing today?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: I'm doing great."", ""Deidre Woollard: So 2023 brought a new phrase to our investing lexicon. We had the fang before it, then we got the Menomena, and now we have the Magnificent Seven, which is Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. The acronyms change over time, the companies in the acronyms change, but as investors, we always know a small amount of stocks are going to drive a lot of our returns. We just don't always know which ones. Kirsten, how are you considering the role of the magnificent seven in a portfolio?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: I think sometimes investors get caught up in the newer stories. There's an inclination to want something exciting, something under the radar, and I totally get that. The idea of investing into the magnificent seven, which still not sure how I feel about that name, sounds boring to me too. Yet I do have a couple of these in my portfolio. I actually hold them in a category that, in my head, I call defense. Honestly, I think about those as just like an NFL team defense. At the very least, I expect these companies to hold things down on the field to preserve capital, reliably add to my returns through dividends or buybacks. Because these are mature companies, they have strong motes and they can absolutely do that. But honestly, some of them with all the cash flows that they generate, they have the potential to do considerably more than that. They're may be more exciting than some people think. A great defense, after all can sometimes return it all the way for a touchdown. They serve multiple purposes there. There's a lot of reliability and steady returns to be expected from the Magnificent Seven. But when you've got resources and influence like these massive companies do, there's a lot of room for upside as well."", ""Deidre Woollard: With the Magnificent Seven. You've got some of them in your portfolio. I've got some of them in my portfolio. Luckily, I have other things in my portfolio that did well in 2023. One of our founders, David Gardner, he says, let your winners keep winning. Let your winners run. It sounds easy. But my experience as an investor and I don't know about yours, it's a little nerve-racking. When I see a company, especially a company that suddenly goes on a tear. I get nervous because I know winning isn't infinite. What do you ask yourself when a stock that you've owned, all of a sudden it's sky rocketing. What do you do? What do you think about?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: I don't get nervous. Should I get nervous?"", 'Deidre Woollard: No.', ""Kirsten Guerra: I do, of course. It's really hard to give a blanket answer of what exactly to look for. Every company is a unique snowflake, not to be confused with actual Snowflake. Ideally, I think if you are invested into a company that's gone on to be a solid winner in your portfolio. You also wrote some investing thesis at the time you invested. That outlined a little bit on why you think it's a great opportunity. Metrics you think are important to watch for its success and what you think are the biggest risks to watch out for. If you did that, then evaluating a winner should be as simple as checking the current state of the company against that thesis and just see if it still holds up. If not, first, I would recommend doing that in the future. But if not, there are still some key things that you can ask yourself, like how much opportunity is left for this company? Does it still have a long runway or are there signs that the market is actually expanding around it? Sometimes big winners actually tap into some latent demand. A opportunity we couldn't even articulate today, what I was suggesting with Apple a minute ago. But it starts to become more evident as the company really takes off. You can think of an Uber for this concept and how it was originally valued based on the overall taxi market."", ""But in fact, we now know that the tech enabled ease of ride hailing from anywhere that Uber introduced really generated far more interest than the taxi industry because it actually created a whole new use case. It was far bigger than anyone really expected. Look for that if you do see evidence that a company's opportunity is continuing to grow or that they're exercising optionality in some complementary direction. That could be a really great sign that there's still plenty of growth ahead and it's worth hanging onto. Another thing that you'll want to check in on is whether the company is maintaining a durable advantage. Because when you're investing for the long term, as we all are, it's really important to have some confidence that a company can continue to be top dog in its field for years to come. Sometimes the reason a company turns out to be a big winner in the near term is just because it was first to market. Or it disrupted an industry with a far better way of doing things. It gained a lot of attention and sort of ran directly into a greenfield opportunity. But that doesn't usually last forever, or even very long. If your winning company proved the viability of a new market and made that attractive, you should expect that there will be plenty of competitors on their tails and look a little deeper into whether your company has that customer connection that will allow it to continue to hold onto the lead or any other competitive advantage that can keep it on top."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. I liked what you said there about Uber too, because you think about a total addressable market. We've seen this with companies like in video, AMD increasing their total addressable market. But with Uber, had you started off with replacing taxis, then ride hailing, then you got into, Uber eats and all of a sudden you have a whole new total addressable market. That's a really good point in wanting to see a company see where they can grow, where they can expand, as well as deepen their original proposition. Let's talk about one of them that definitely found a green field and that's Duolingo. It's been a tremendous run for that one. Recent earnings showed a really strong jump in paid membership up to 5.8 million. What makes Duolingo a winner?"", 'Kirsten Guerra: Duolingo has just got great unit economics. It operates a freemium business model, so anyone can use the app for free, which is really important for building the social network element that is inherent in this app. Then the dedicated users who want to and who want more advanced features can go premium for a monthly fee. The pretty common model these days, but Duo is very, very efficient at upgrading those users. Whoever runs their marketing team, especially their Tiktok, probably needs another raise because they are so so good at generating new users, new premium users. Really just spreading brand awareness of the company in general at relatively low customer acquisition costs.', ""Deidre Woollard: Also, I think stickiness, I think for winners, a lot of it you want to see stickiness whether it's on the B2B side where it's a software that a business can't live without or whether it's on a consumer side with something that is just really addictive. I mean, I think the thing about Duolingo is people want to keep their streaks. You've got daily active users up to 24 million. That's a really great thing. But with the consumer side, it's always a little tricky. The consumer is so fickle. Trends do end. What could potentially go wrong with Duolingo as you watch it?"", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, I'm one of those fickle users too. Keeps getting upset at me. The icon will actually start melting on my desktop. It's like this dramatic. Anyway, they're very good at bringing you back. But yeah, trends certainly end, but someone somewhere will always be learning a new language. A lot of someones, it's estimated upward of a billion people at any given time are learning a language. That's not going away still. That doesn't mean that interest in language learning couldn't shift elsewhere. It's done that before. Before Duolingo, Rosetta Stone was the big name in computer aided language learning. But Duo's mobile focus is really what helped it capture all the mind share from that former powerhouse. Duolingo definitely needs to stay alert and continue to be the innovator in this space. It's not disrupted from another direction in the same way that it disrupted before. But it does have also the social element that Rosetta Stone never did. There are lots of friend networks that are on this app, kind of learning together and celebrating each other. That does make it harder to unseat."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. I think the social aspect of the business is a surprising part of it. I know you've talked before about Spotify too and that has that social aspect as well. I think that's one of the things that you can't really factor it into, into the business itself, but it definitely contributes to the thesis."", ""Kirsten Guerra: Yeah, absolutely.. It's not the strongest network in the world. It's not a Facebook for example, but it's certainly there."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. Well, in thinking about these winners, one of the things I think about is looking forward. One of the stories of the most recent quarter was that you would have a company that would come up with good, solid, great earnings. But then they had a modest forecast and the market was not happy. You saw things go down relatively quickly. I tend to be a fan of the realistic CEO with the modest forecast, but the market loves the bombastic CEO with the big prediction, especially when they pull it off, but even sometimes when they don't.

That's something that Tim and I did. Tim Beyers, who I work with on a service here. We saw a leader make a claim and we thought, big, if true. We went back and did a deep dive of claims that the CEO had made over the last 10 years or so, and just noted how accurately each of them played out, it turns out really well.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.', 'Where are Bob Iger and Jimmy Pitaro?', 'The Disney and ESPN chiefs have both been conspicuously silent as sports shock jock Pat McAfee very publicly uses their air to host a weekly conspiracy program with injured New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers — an off-the-rails affair that recently tarred and feathered Jimmy Kimmel within the Magic Kingdom’s own walls.', 'Neither Iger nor Pitaro said a word Tuesday as Rodgers made his way back to ESPN’s air, using his regular appearance on the Disney-owned channel to go on an extended — and, at times, fact-free — rant on a range of topics unrelated to sports. Rodgers, who McAfee handsomely pays to appear on the show once a week, spread medical misinformation, he assailed the media, and even went as far as to rail against an ESPN executive in front of hundreds of thousands of live viewers.', 'The only thing Rodgers couldn’t muster up the courage to do? Publicly apologize to Kimmel — a trait he currently shares with Iger and Pitaro, both of whom have not said a word as their late-night star has seen his reputation repeatedly called into question and sullied on ESPN.', 'Instead, Rodgers further sought to maim the ABC comedian, skewering him in a bizarre rant for standing with the medical community and the likes of Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic by recommending people get vaccinated and take basic precautions to avoid spreading the virus.', 'Beyond the issue of his ceaseless attacks on Kimmel, it is astonishing that Disney continues to permit Rodgers to spread vaccine misinformation and smear widely respected public health authorities like Fauci on the company’s massive platforms. That puts Disney, a reputable brand that aims to be as inoffensive as possible, in the company of Fox News, the only other major television broadcaster that comes to mind that allows for the irresponsible and unchecked airing of such anti-intellectual drivel.', 'To be fair, Disney and ESPN are dealing with a complex problem. It’s not easy to rein in big personalities — especially when neither McAfee nor Rodgers are ESPN employees. ESPN licenses McAfee’s show (the company doesn’t produce it) and Rodgers has no direct business relationship with the sports channel.', 'But it’s a bed that Iger and Pitaro made when they willfully entered into a business relationship with McAfee and inked an eye-popping agreement (reportedly worth $85 million) to expand it last year. McAfee is McAfee. He has not changed. And neither Iger nor Pitaro should be surprised with the mess they are now being forced to clean up.', 'The complexities of the problem also do not preclude Disney from taking some form of public action. The hands of Iger and Pitaro are not entirely tied. The Disney boss and ESPN chief might be behaving as if they are paralyzed, but there are unquestionably levers that they can pull to make it clear that the rhetoric being beamed by the “worldwide leader in sports” to the masses is unacceptable. After all, it is their air.', 'Pulling those levers and/or taking a public stand for basic decency would certainly take a few ounces of courage. It would require backbone. And it would likely fracture business relationships that Disney would prefer to maintain. But standing still has, thus far, proved to be an ineffective strategy in containing the mess. And, given McAfee and Rodgers’ propensity for controversy, the issues underpinning this particular episode will likely continue to be a recurring problem. While the current uproar might soon quiet down, Kimmel has forced a magnifying glass over the show, which will remain.', 'Iger and Pitaro have a mountain of decidedly larger problems that they must contend with, including bringing ESPN into the streaming future. They have probably hoped that this will resolve on its own. But, like a gnawing headache, it’s not going away.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is DIS Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Disney, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.38.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Disney.

A fall in expenses was also a driving factor. However, a decrease in non-interest income and higher provisions acted as headwinds.', 'MTB’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The surprise was 8.09%, on average.', 'M&T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&T Bank Corporation Quote', 'The company’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter have not encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward.

Nonetheless, demand for commercial and residential real estate loans improved in November from third-quarter 2023 levels. Also, consumer lending showed some signs of advancement throughout November. Hence, we believe loan growth for M&T Bank is likely to have been modest.', 'This is likely to have positively impacted average interest earning assets during the quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets is pegged at $190.56 billion, suggesting nearly 1.7% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure.', 'Also, while Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes during fourth-quarter 2023, interest rates remained at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%.

The uptrend is likely to have continued during the fourth quarter. However, the removal of non-sufficient fund fees and overdraft protection transfer charges from linked-deposit accounts is likely to have continued affecting revenues from service charges on deposit accounts in the to-be-reported quarter.', 'The consensus estimate for the metric is pegged at $119 million, indicating a sequential fall of 1.7%.', 'In the quarter under review, mortgage rates started to decrease, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage declining to 6.62% as of Dec 31, 2023, from 7.31% recorded at the beginning of the quarter. Though mortgage rates declined, they remain sufficiently high, keeping home buyers on the sidelines.

If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now. "", ""Innovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's."", 'When we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.', ""Apple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022."", ""However, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market."", ""While most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets."", ""Looking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Shares of Johnson & Johnson have gained +3.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +17.3%. The company due to the separation of the Consumer Health unit, has now become a two-sector company focused on the Innovative Medicine and MedTech fields.Growth in the Innovative Medicine unit is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by a recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.J&J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. However, headwinds like generic competition and pricing pressure persist.

The company’s better-than-expected first-quarter performance, along with sequential growth across all key metrics, reflects the benefits of an improving supply-demand environment and signals that the industrywide sluggish period is nearing its end, and the company is moving back to profitability.The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in artificial intelligence spending is expected to fuel demand for its chips used in the data center end market. A rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers as well.Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage. However, the United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here >>>)Southern Company’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past six months (+3.7% vs. -4.7%). The company is leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, as in healthy population and job growth, the utility has gradually increased its customer base.With good rate-base growth and constructive regulations, the power supplier is expected to generate steady earnings and dividend growth in the coming years. However, its elevated leverage, along with continued timing and cost overrun issues over its Vogtle project, are major overhangs.While the electric utility holding company’s debt-to-capitalization of 62.6% restricts financial flexibility, its $25-billion Vogtle nuclear plant has already exceeded budget and is years behind schedule.

This was driven by a terrific surge in tech stocks that found favor with investors once again on the back of cooling inflation, the pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, and new catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""A closer look at past trends indicates that the Nasdaq-100 could have another stellar year in 2024. Since its inception in 1985, the Nasdaq-100 has seen only seven down years. What's more, the index has tended to bounce back impressively in the two years following a down year. For example, it jumped 53% in 2009 and 19% in 2010 following a sharp decline of 42% in 2008."", ""We have already seen that the index soared impressively last year, and that followed a steep drop of 33% in 2022. While past events can't always tell us how the future may pan out, there are indications that the Nasdaq could keep surging in 2024. For instance, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates this year on account of cooling inflation."", ""At the same time, tech stocks can get a boost thanks to the potential growth in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets, as well as the surging demand for AI chips. That's why now would be a good time for investors to put their money into shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), a Nasdaq stock that's trading at attractive levels now and that could go on a terrific bull run in 2024 thanks to AI."", ""AI is going to play a major role in helping Micron Technology return to growth in the current fiscal year, following a disappointing performance in the last one. The memory specialist's revenue fell by half in fiscal 2023 (which ended in August last year) to $15.5 billion, while it swung to a non-GAAP loss of $4.45 per share, compared to a profit of $8.35 per share in the prior year."", ""However, the memory market's oversupply has ended, driven mainly by the growing demand for memory chips being deployed in AI applications. For instance, Micron's peer SK Hynix estimates that the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are deployed in AI servers, could increase at an impressive annual rate of 82% through 2027. Samsung has also seen its orders for HBM double in 2023."", ""The good news is that Micron is all set to capitalize on the fast-growing HBM opportunity with the help of Nvidia. Micron management recently pointed out that its latest generation of HBM chips is in the final stages of qualification for Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip and the upcoming H200 AI graphics processing unit (GPU), which are set for launch this year."", ""Nvidia's H200 GPU is set to be equipped with HBM3e. The chipmaker points out that this memory chip will increase the memory bandwidth of its upcoming AI GPU by 43% to 4.8 terabytes per second, compared to the current-generation H100 processor. What's more, Nvidia is upgrading the memory capacity of the H200 to 141GB (gigabytes) from 80GB on the existing H100 processor."", ""Given that Nvidia is expected to boost the supply of its AI GPUs significantly this year, it's not surprising that reports suggest that it has made a large prepayment to Micron for HBM chips. Citing industry sources, Taiwan-based daily newspaper DigiTimes says that Nvidia has reportedly made an advance worth $770 million to Micron to secure HBM supply."", ""So, it's likely we'll see Nvidia moving the needle in a significant way for Micron this year. However, that's just one way in which AI could positively affect the company's growth. AI deployment in edge devices such as PCs and smartphones is expected to drive higher memory consumption as well."", 'According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, sales of generative AI-powered smartphones could hit 100 million units in 2024. The firm estimates that this market could clock annual growth of 83% through 2027, with a cumulative 1 billion generative AI-enabled smartphones expected to be sold over the next five years. Not surprisingly, Micron management expects ""smartphone OEMs to start ramping AI-enabled smartphones in 2024, with an additional capacity of 4 to 8GB of DRAM per unit.""', 'Micron expects a similar trend to unfold in the PC market. The chipmaker is anticipating manufacturers will start ramping up the production of AI-enabled PCs in the second half of 2024. Micron says that these AI-powered PCs are likely to be equipped with an ""additional capacity of 4 to 8GB of DRAM per unit,"" while their storage capacities should increase as well.', 'This is another key growth opportunity for Micron, given how rapidly the market for AI-powered PCs is expected to grow.', ""All this tells us why Micron's revenue is expected to grow an impressive 48% in the current fiscal year to $23 billion."", ""The company's loss is expected to shrink to just $0.39 per share in the current fiscal year, followed by a significant jump in profit in fiscal 2025 to $6.49 per share. Assuming Micron does hit Wall Street's earnings target over the next year, its stock price could jump to $181 based on the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). That would be a 115% increase from current levels."", ""It's worth noting that Micron stock is trading at less than 13 times forward earnings. This makes it cheaper than Nvidia, which has nearly double the forward earnings multiple."", ""Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 5.6 is also much lower than Nvidia's multiple of 26. As such, investors looking for an AI stock are getting a good deal on shares of Micron Technology right now, and they should consider grabbing this opportunity with both hands before the stock soars higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the energy sector and the outlook for natural gas, and go directly to read 5 Best Natural Gas Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', 'In 2023, energy stocks in the US experienced a significant and abrupt downturn. This decline was a significant change from the prior year when the energy sector was leading the way in the S&P 500 index. However, the energy industry transformed into one of the worst-performing sectors last year, trailing behind only utility stocks in terms of decline. The S&P 500 Energy index fell by over 4%, standing in stark contrast to the overall performance of the S&P 500, which registered a substantial gain of 24% during the same period.', 'In addition to this, U.S. natural gas futures saw a significant drop in 2023, marking the most substantial percentage decline since 2006. This decline was primarily attributed to several factors, including exceptionally high production levels, abundant reserves, and a mild winter season. The prices of natural gas experienced a sharp fall throughout 2023, notably contrasting the levels seen in 2022, where they had reached approximately $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). This decrease followed the disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, which had driven prices upward in the previous year.', ""That said, data tracking LNG tankers revealed that the US reached unprecedented monthly and yearly highs in liquefied natural gas exports in December. Analysts noted this surge in exports poised the U.S. to surpass both Qatar and Australia, potentially securing its position as the top LNG exporter in 2023. According to Alex Munton, who heads global gas and LNG research at the Rapidan Energy Group consulting firm, the US showcased remarkable growth in LNG supply throughout 2023. December specifically saw a significant rise, with 8.6 million metric tons leaving U.S. terminals, highlighting the country's standout performance in the global LNG market."", ""Analysts are expressing optimism about the energy sector's outlook for 2024. One reason for this positive sentiment is the healthy financial condition of energy companies. Their balance sheets are robust, indicating stability and strength in their financial positions. Additionally, significant players in the industry like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) have been increasing the dividends they pay to shareholders. According to Citigroup analyst Scott Gruber, natural gas might have a more favorable outlook compared to oil in the upcoming year. Anticipated increases in gas prices later in 2024 stem from the US efforts to construct export terminals, intending to ship larger quantities of gas to Europe and Asia. This expansion in exports is expected to be beneficial for American gas producers."", 'Analysts, as per Bloomberg, have set an average price target of $3.35 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas in 2024, indicating potentially significant gains considering the current price hovers around $2.50. Gruber highlights EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) and Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) as his preferred natural gas stocks for the upcoming year, likely based on their prospects for growth and performance in the evolving market conditions.

As of Sep 30, Chevron has $5.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with a total debt of $20.6 billion and a conservative debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 11%.

Capital One (NYSE: COF) rose 17.4%, Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY) rose 19.5% and SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) charged 36.5% higher during the month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.', ""The financial sector got a huge boost following the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 13. The Fed's commentary indicated that it is likely done with its aggressive interest rate hikes, and that rate cuts are a strong possibility in 2024. SoFi, Capital One, and Ally stocks all launched higher following the central bank's statements. Increased interest rates have curbed demand for their consumer financial products, so the latest news on monetary policy was a welcome signal that conditions are likely to improve over the next few quarters. The stocks rallied on that optimism in unison."", 'The Federal Reserve took decisive action to help slow runaway inflation in 2022 by implementing one of the most rapid interest rate hike campaigns in its history. High interest rates discourage corporate growth initiatives, consumer spending, and riskier investment decisions in capital markets. As a result, rate hikes hinder demand -- and price growth -- for goods, services, and labor across the economy.', 'Inflation was creating serious issues for consumers and businesses alike, suggesting that the economy was ""overheated"" to an unsustainable level. The Fed\'s rate hikes were considered a necessary evil to control inflation, even if it hurt unemployment or caused a recession in the near term.The financial sector is an important cog in the economic wheel, and banks\' results tend to fluctuate with the broader economic cycle. These companies were particularly jeopardized due to the specific products that generate most of their revenue and income.', ""SoFi, Capital One, and Ally are much more heavily exposed to consumer lending products than the major banks and diversified financial institutions. Most of SoFi's revenue comes from its consumer loans, which include mortgages, student loans, and personal loans. Personal loans, such as refinanced credit card debt, make up the biggest portion of its interest revenue. Capital One leans much more heavily on credit card business, which generated more than 60% of its net interest income last quarter. Consumer debt, such as auto loans, contributed an additional 35% of the bank's revenue. Ally has an enormous automotive finance business, which contributed 90% of its revenue in its most recent quarter. This was supplemented by its smaller corporate finance and mortgage businesses."", 'These three consumer finance companies all occupy different niches, but they share many of the same catalysts. They rely on consumer spending, financing, and refinancing activity. That activity really dries up when layoffs make people uncertain about their future income, or when interest rates are high enough to discourage refinancing, homebuying, and big-ticket purchases.', 'SoFi, Capital One, and Ally can be contrasted with the major banks, which are more diversified institutions with different growth drivers. The results of major banks like Bank of America or Wells Fargo are less influenced by the performance of any individual product category. The consumer finance stocks should be highly correlated to other members of the sector, but they are more sensitive to investor expectations on automotive sales, credit card utilization, and consumer loans.', 'If we really are on the cusp of rate cuts and the desired recession-free ""soft landing,"" then conditions are likely to improve for SoFi, Capital One, and Ally. There\'s a clear bullish narrative for all three companies, but it depends on economic outlook and consumer behaviors. Rate cuts and strong economic data are likely to send the stocks higher. If high rates linger longer than anticipated or we wind up plunging into a recession, these stocks are likely to sustain losses.', 'SoFi has a reputation as a fintech company, going back to its operations before it commenced banking operations. That reputation, combined with an enormous opportunity associated with the return of student loan refinancing demand, leads to loftier investor expectations and a premium valuation. This gives SoFi some dynamic growth stock traits, but it can also create extra downside risk. The stock has already lost most of its December gains, thanks to an analyst downgrade.', ""Capital One and Ally are more similar to other mature bank stocks. They pay dividends and their market caps closely reflect their book values. Both stocks are priced reasonably enough to provide upside potential if rates are indeed slashed in 2024 and consumer spending is resilient. Ally and Capital One probably won't fluctuate as much in price as SoFi, be it higher or lower."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoFi Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoFi Technologies wasn’t one of them.

This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast.

(NYSE:KO), the favorite company of legendary investor Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio). Coca-Cola has successfully raised its dividends for 62 consecutive years. However, the company experienced a challenging year in 2023, marked by a 4.8% decline in share price over 12 months. This performance significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (SPY) return of nearly 24%. Given these circumstances, let's look at the company to determine if it is a good choice for income investors at its current price."", ""Coca-Cola, a globally renowned brand, hardly needs an introduction. Established in 1886, it is now the world's largest beverage company, operating in over 200 countries and territories. Its portfolio includes five major non-alcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Light/Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. A key strength of the company is its expansive global distribution network, which includes a mix of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Impressively, Coca-Cola distributes approximately 2.2 billion servings daily."", ""The company's operations are segmented into six main geographical regions: North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Bottling Investment and Global Ventures. In 2022, the North American segment was its largest revenue contributor, generating $15.7 billion, which accounted for 36.4% of total revenue. The Bottling Investments segment followed with $7.9 billion in revenue, representing 18.3%. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region contributed $6.9 billion in sales, making up 16% of the total. The Latin America and Asia Pacific segments were closely matched, with revenue of $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion."", ""Coca-Cola has firmly established itself as a top choice in consumers' minds. Since 2008, its market share in the U.S. non-alcoholic beverage market has increased from 42.6% to 46.3% in 2022. Over the past two decades, Coca-Cola's revenue growth hasn't been steady, with increases noted in only 12 out of the 20 years. From 2002 to 2022, its revenue grew from $19.56 billion to $43 billion, achieving a compounded annual growth rate of 4%. Similarly, its operating income rose from $5.46 billion in 2002 to $12.25 billion in 2022, with a CAGR of 4.1%."", 'Though not a high-growth business, Coca-Cola stands out for its high profitability.

In 2022, the company reported a gross margin of 58.14% and an operating margin of 28.5%.', ""Coca-Cola is also a consistent cash flow generator. Over the years, it has maintained a positive operating and free cash flow trend. From 2002 to 2022, its operating cash flow grew substantially, from $4.74 billion to $11 billion. Simultaneously, the free cash flow also experienced significant growth, rising from $3.89 billion in 2002 to $9.53 billion in 2022. This consistent profitability and positive cash flow generation highlight Coca-Cola's strong business and operational efficiency."", ""At first glance, investors might be concerned about Coca-Cola's high debt-to-equity ratio. As of September, the company had total equity of $27.83 billion, much lower than its interest-bearing debt of $40.17 billion. Thus, the debt-to-equity ratio is considered to be high at 1.44. However, this lower shareholder equity is primarily due to nearly $54 billion in treasury stock, representing the accumulated share repurchases over the years."", ""Furthermore, while the total debt may seem substantial, it's important to note that long-term debt is structured with maturities spread over many years, extending as far as 2093. From 2023 to 2026, the debt principal due each year ranges from $399 million to nearly $2 billion. In 2027, the principal payment will be close to $4.5 billion. Given Coca-Cola's average operating cash flow of $10 billion over the past five years, the company appears well positioned to effectively manage its interest payments and debt obligations."", ""Because of the company's strong moat, global brand and dividend track record, Buffett initiated Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) position in Coca-Cola in 1988 and has become the largest shareholder with 400 million shares. His cost basis was only nearly $3.25 per share, with a total investment of nearly $1.3 billion. As Coca-Cola paid $1.84 per share, his 400 million shares received $736 million in dividend payments alone, representing a yield on cost of a whopping 57%."", 'Indeed, Coca-Cola has an exceptional track record of consistently increasing its dividend for the past 62 years. Its dividend has increased from 40 cents per share in 2002 to $1.76 per share in 2022, with an annual compounded growth rate of nearly 7.67%.', ""The Gordon Growth Model, which is particularly suited for evaluating companies with a consistent history of dividend growth, is highly applicable to Coca-Cola due to its remarkable record of increasing dividends for 66 consecutive years. To estimate the intrinsic value of the stock using this model, let's assume the company will continue to grow its dividends at a reduced rate of 6%. By applying a discount rate of 8%, we can estimate the stock's intrinsic value as follows:"", 'P = Expected Dividend for 2024 / (Required Rate of Return - Dividend Growth Rate)', '= $1.84 *(1+6%) / (8%-6%)', '= $97.52', ""Applying the Gorden Growth Model, Coca-Cola's intrinsic value is estimated at around $97.5 per share, indicating a potential 62.5% upside from the current trading price."", ""Coca-Cola presents a compelling case for income investors. With a legacy of 62 consecutive years of dividend increases and a global presence unparalleled in the beverage industry, the company stands as a paragon of stability and resilience. Despite the recent share price decline and concerns over its debt-to-equity ratio, Coca-Cola's robust financial health, as evidenced by its strong cash flow generation and operational efficiency, positions it well to manage these challenges."", ""Buffett's longstanding investment and the remarkable yield on cost from Coca-Cola's dividends further underline its attractiveness. Moreover, applying the Gordon Growth Model suggests a significant potential upside in its stock value.

Initially equipped with 90 beds, ACHC will add another 106 beds, thus taking the total licensed bed count of the hospital to 196. Bed additions are often a means for the behavioral healthcare services provider to earn higher revenues from its facilities.', 'The enlarged facility will be known as “Cross Creek Hospital together with Ascension Seton” and is likely to become operational in late 2024. It will also play the role of training students, residents and fellows of The University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School.', 'The ulterior motive of Acadia Healthcare in forming this JV remains to seek assistance from Ascension Seton hospitals and follow a collaborative approach to bring about improved health outcomes throughout the Austin community. Before this, ACHC had also formed a JV with Ascension to build the Tennessee-based Ascension Saint Thomas Behavioral Health Hospital, which started operating in 2021. ', 'Therefore, Acadia Healthcare seems prudent to have taken the help of Ascension, which has been catering to the needs of Texas residents for more than 12 decades. Ascension will enable ACHC to gain an in-depth understanding of the behavioral health needs of the Austin region and hence, serve patients better.', 'Through providing increased access to behavioral healthcare to Texas residents, the statewide presence of ACHC is expected to be further solidified. Being a faith-based healthcare organization, Ascension places special focus on treating the poor and most vulnerable populations, thereby making the recent JV of ACHC all the more noteworthy.', 'The latest announcement marks the 21st JV partnership of Acadia Healthcare. JVs usually combine the expertise, capabilities and resources of both partners and hence, attributable to such growth-related initiatives, ACHC has been successful in building an enhanced behavioral healthcare services suite and diversifying its treatment network.', 'Management remains optimistic about pursuing similar partnerships with leading U.S. health systems in the future to address mental health issues and substance use disorders prevailing throughout the country. In 2024, the hospitals, which are likely to be constructed as a result of Acadia Healthcare’s JV partnerships with Henry Ford Health and Intermountain Health, are likely to become operational.', 'Shares of Acadia Healthcare have inched up 1.5% in the past six months against the industry’s 4.4% decline.

It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!"", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Sempra ', ""As Sempra operates in the integrated utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$76.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$2.6 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$64.8', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Vulcan Materials with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Vulcan Materials grew its EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Vulcan Materials shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 14% to 17% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Vulcan Materials' future profits."", ""Since Vulcan Materials has a market capitalisation of US$30b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$48m. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 0.2%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders."", ""It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Vulcan Materials, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m."", ""The Vulcan Materials CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense."", ""One important encouraging feature of Vulcan Materials is that it is growing profits. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Vulcan Materials, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Vulcan Materials has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases."", 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Increased exposure, streamlined operations, global presence, better pricing, solid underwriting and a strong capital position likely helped the industry perform well. Per Fitch Ratings, the industry is poised to perform well going ahead, banking on improved personal auto, lower claims and an increase in investment.The performance of non-life insurers is measured by underwriting profitability.\xa0 According to AM Best, total net underwriting loss was $32.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, higher than $24.6 billion incurred in the year-ago period. Rising loss costs, above-average catastrophe activity and adverse trends in personal auto resulted in the wider losses. The combined ratio was 103.5 for the same time frame, per the credit rating giant, to which catastrophe losses added 980 basis points. Underwriting profitability is affected by occurrences of catastrophes. Per a report in Munich RE, losses from natural disasters in 2023 were $250 billion. Fitch estimates the combined ratio to remain above 100 in 2024Catastrophes also impact pricing in the space. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 24 straight quarters, though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improved pricing drives higher premiums, ensuring smooth claims settlement.Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Fitch Ratings, personal auto is likely to deliver better performance in 2024. This, coupled with better investment results and lower claims, should fuel insurers' performance this year, per Fitch Ratings. \xa0The insurance industry benefits from a rising rate environment. The Fed paused rate hikes in its last three meetings in 2023 and there remains a high probability of rate cuts in 2024. The interest rate currently stands at 5.25-5.50%.Accelerated digitalization continues to improve scale and efficiency. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level supports inorganic expansion, investment in growth initiatives and capital payout to shareholders.Here, we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely W.R. Berkley Corporation WRB and Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF. W.R. Berkley, with a market capitalization of $18.6 billion, is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether LKQ's current trading price of US$46.86 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at LKQ’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' View our latest analysis for LKQ ', ""The share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that LKQ’s ratio of 13.19x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 14.27x, which means if you buy LKQ today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe LKQ should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that LKQ’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. LKQ's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 20%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in LKQ’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at LKQ? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LKQ, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for LKQ, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 3 warning signs for LKQ and we think they deserve your attention."", 'If you are no longer interested in LKQ, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

But even after the cut, Walgreens yields 4%. And investors might be eyeing the stock as a potential turnaround play now that management has lowered one of its higher expenses and freed up cash to improve the business.', ""However, weak fundamentals and declining earnings make Walgreens too risky for the potential reward. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are five better Dow dividend stocks to buy now."", ""Apple yields just 0.5%, but that's a result of its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to its dividend."", 'Management has raised its dividend every year since 2012. And over the past 10 years, its dividend has more than doubled while its outstanding share count has fallen 37.7% thanks to buybacks.', ""Apple's cash-cow business model allows it to make dividend raises and buy back stock even during a slowdown, which we've seen play out over the last couple of years."", ""It's a good dividend stock for investors who value a quality business, buybacks, and dividend raises more than a high yield."", 'Like Apple, P&G is not purely a dividend play. It also has a sizable buyback program. And the business is as solid as ever.', 'The stock underperformed the market big time in 2023. Patient investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy a quality business at a good valuation.', 'P&G is one of the best-run businesses out there and arguably the single strongest business in the entire consumer staples sector. It has impeccable pricing power and industry-leading products across a wide variety of categories, including beauty; grooming; healthcare; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care.', ""Management has a track record of developing brands. The company's performance in fiscal 2023 proved that brands really do matter, even for everyday household products like laundry detergent, paper towels, razors, and more."", 'P&G operates a high-margin business, with recession resilience and a diversified business model. The only question investors should ask before buying the stock is whether it is expensive. At a 23.9 price-to-earnings ratio, it is trading around the same multiple as the S&P 500 -- which is reasonable for such a high-quality business even though it is growing slowly.', 'Like P&G, Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. It is one of the most reliable healthcare income stocks out there.', 'But the J&J of today is different than the J&J of the past, mainly because it spun off its consumer-healthcare products into a new company called Kenvue. The idea is that the ""new"" J&J will grow faster, with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.', 'Dividend Kings are known for their reliability, not for chasing growth. But J&J should have no trouble raising its dividend even with a more growth-orientated business. The company is a cash cow, generating far more free cash flow every year than it uses to pay the dividend.', ""J&J also has one of the strongest balance sheets, with total net long-term debt of a mere $6.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for a company with a market cap of $388 billion."", 'With a 3% dividend yield, a reliable business model, and a phenomenal balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend stock that investors can count on in 2024 and beyond.', 'Walmart is another example where the quality of the business, not the yield, is the primary focus. Its shares yield just 1.5% -- which is far less appealing than a stock like J&J.', 'But Walmart is also a Dividend King. It tends to make small dividend raises, choosing instead to reinvest and grow the business.', ""Perhaps Walmart's greatest quality is its ability to perform in a challenging environment. The business is all about undercutting the competition with the lowest prices and providing the best value for its customers. When the economy is faltering, or there's a changing business climate, it is a safe haven with the sophisticated supply chain needed to take market share."", 'Recent conditions provide a good stress test:', ""The company's results have been excellent, even as consumers have shifted from discretionary categories to staples. Walmart doesn't have nearly the same exposure to discretionary categories as its competitors, like Target. Years of long-term investments and expansions, paired with precise execution throughout this challenging time, have helped Walmart put up solid results, given the circumstances."", 'Walmart is the perfect stock for investors looking for a company that is less dependent on a strong economy to do well.', 'Coming in with a 4% dividend yield and nonstop annual payout raises since 1990, Chevron is an underrated dividend stock. It might not generate the consistent cash flow that Walmart, J&J, or P&G do. But it has an incredibly strong balance sheet and can fund the dividend and its operations even when oil is $50 a barrel.', 'Chevron is also geographically diversified and includes much more than just the upstream side of the industry. It has a sizable downstream business and is investing in low-carbon efforts.', ""It can do incredibly well and generate outsize profits when oil is a relatively high or even mediocre price like today's $78 Brent crude per-barrel price. That upside potential, paired with a large margin for error, makes Chevron a reliable income stock in a volatile sector."", 'Apple, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, and Chevron are five completely different companies in five different industries. But all five Dow stocks are components for a reason.', 'Each company should be able to fund dividend raises by growing its business. It sounds simple, but often we see powerful companies gradually lose their edge to competition. Or in the case of Walgreens, it lost market share and sustained ill-fated dividend raises for far too long.', ""All 30 Dow components are meant to represent their respective sector as a role model. Apple, P&G, J&J, Walmart, and Chevron do that well, which can't be said for every Dow stock.

Focusing on stocks that have proven themselves over time via a steadily increasing dividend is a good first step."", 'If those companies also happen to be industry leaders, all the better. Here are three such companies that, when they go on sale, you should probably consider adding to your portfolio.', 'Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) has a market cap of over $340 billion, making it one of the largest consumer staples companies on the planet. It has the scale to invest heavily in advertising, distribution, and -- perhaps most important -- research and development.', 'It tends to be a leader in the industry when it comes to launching new and improved versions of products like toothpaste, toilet paper, and deodorant. Consumers love the words new and improved, and retailers love that such products draw customers into their stores, which makes P&G a valuable supplier.', ""Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend annually for 67 years. The average annual increase over the past decade was around 5%, which isn't huge but is more than enough to keep the buying power of its dividend growing faster than inflation."", ""The problem is that the yield is around 2.5%, which is the middle of the road for P&G. This suggests that the stock isn't cheap today, which is not a shock, given its industry-leading position in the consumer staples space because many of its brands sit at the high end of the price spectrum. However, if the stock price were to take a notable dip, even the most conservative investors should consider adding P&G to their portfolios."", ""Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is one of the largest steel makers in North America. It also has one of the most diversified product portfolios in the industry. Add in a structural advantage because it uses more modern electric arc mini-mills that can be more easily ramped up and down with demand than older blast furnaces, and there's a lot to like about this company."", 'It also has a vertically integrated business model and great relations with its employees, who are largely non-union. Still, investors need to remember a very simple fact: Steel is a highly cyclical industry.', ""That just makes the company's status as a Dividend King, with 50 years of annual dividend increases, all the more impressive. The average annual dividend increase over the past decade was 3%, which is roughly in line with inflation."", 'This is one of the reasons why investors will want to wait until the stock takes a sizable dip before buying. The dividend yield today is around 1.2%, which is pretty modest. Given the cyclical nature of the steel sector, however, patient long-term investors should wait and only buy this industry leader when Wall Street is throwing the baby out with the bathwater in an economic downturn.', 'Compared to oil and natural gas, steel looks like a calm sea. Supply and demand, geopolitical tensions, government interventions, and the OPEC oil cartel can all rattle the energy sector in a swift and dramatic fashion.', ""This is why ExxonMobil's (NYSE: XOM) 41 consecutive annual dividend increases are so impressive. The average increase over the past decade was a bit over 4%."", ""One of the keys to ExxonMobil's dividend consistency is the company's strong balance sheet, with a very modest debt-to-equity ratio of 0.2 times. When oil prices are weak, ExxonMobil adds debt so it can keep paying the dividend and invest in its business. When oil prices recover, as they have always done historically, it pays off that debt."", ""It's been a winning formula for dividend investors. The yield today is around 3.7%, which is the most attractive on this list. However, during oil downturns, it can get much, much higher."", ""There's no one right way to pick a stock, but if you're a conservative income-focused investor, going with industry-leading stocks is a good starting point. If they also happen to have decades of annual dividend increases behind them, all the better."", ""The problem is that such stocks, which include P&G, Nucor, and ExxonMobil, don't go on sale all that often. This is why you want to prepare ahead of time by putting these companies on your wish list, just in case their stocks take a big dip.

Putting enough money in a savings account or winning the lottery are among them. However, neither of these methods can hold a candle to investing in stocks. Savings accounts generally earn paltry interest rates, while no one can bet on winning the lottery.', ""By contrast, with an initial capital of $100,000 and 20 years to work with, it takes a compound annual growth rate of 12.2% to become a millionaire. That's not easy to pull off -- but it is well within many investors' reach."", ""With that said, let's consider a stock that has a chance to help you achieve that goal: biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN). The drugmaker has delivered excellent returns in recent years, but can it help make an investor a millionaire? Let's find out."", ""In the past few decades, Regeneron has delivered returns well above what it would need in the next 20 years to turn $100,000 into $1 million. Notice that the biotech's revenue and earnings have generally been on a solid upward path."", ""One of the keys behind the drugmaker's accomplishment has been its ability to develop and market innovative medicines. In recent years, its two main growth drivers have been Eylea, which treats an eye disorder, and eczema treatment Dupixent. Other products have contributed, but not anywhere near the level of these two. Eylea is at risk of facing biosimilar competition."", 'Fortunately, Regeneron earned FDA approval for an upgraded, high-dose version of Eylea that requires fewer injections per year, allowing it to keep many of its patients. Meanwhile, Dupixent still seems to have plenty of growth left ahead, with important label expansions on the horizon. Still, even Dupixent will see key patents start to expire early next decade.', ""In short, Eylea and Dupixent won't be able to keep Regeneron's momentum for the next 20 years. The biotech will have to turn elsewhere. The good news is that these two growth drivers should continue, allowing Regeneron to record solid financial results and returns through the end of the decade."", ""So, the question is whether Regeneron can replace its current growth drivers. One glance at the company's pipeline suggests it can do exactly that. Of the 11 late-stage programs it is running right now, six are brand-new products that have yet to receive approval in the U.S. One of them, potential cancer drug odronextamab, is currently being considered for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; it could hit the market sometime next year."", ""Regeneron's solid late-stage pipeline should yield several new products in the next five years, well before Dupixent's patent cliff. That's to say nothing of the company's early-stage programs, many of which also feature potential medicines that have yet to earn approval anywhere."", 'Further, Regeneron is dipping its toes into such promising areas such as gene editing. The company is partnering with Intellia Therapeutics, a gene-editing specialist. Regeneron has several similar partnerships with smaller biotechs in promising fields, such as gene therapy and gene silencing.', ""No drugmaker has a 100% success rate in developing new medicines, but given Regeneron's deep pipeline, it's safe to say that at least some of its programs in phase 2 and phase 1 studies should eventually yield approvals. Regeneron's current lineup, pipeline, and track record make a strong case for why it can continue delivering excellent financial results."", ""Regeneron has consistently proven its ability to innovate and deliver solid financial results and excellent stock market performance. The company's basic playbook hasn't changed, and in my view, the biotech has an excellent shot at helping investors become millionaires. And even if it falls short of that pretty lofty goal, it shouldn't fall too far short unless something catastrophic happens. That makes Regeneron an excellent biotech stock to buy now and hold onto for the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them.

Forests are also important for us as humans: economically, physically, and even spiritually. There are few things I would rather do than spend quiet and peaceful moments among trees.', ""And yet, the prevalence, severity, and devastation from forest fires is continuing to increase, as we've witnessed throughout 2023. In the United States, and in many other forested areas around the world, decades (if not centuries) of wildfire suppression as well as human-caused climate change can lead to catastrophic wildfires that that devastate communities, grab media attention, and pull at heartstrings across the globe. Recognizing that something must be done, the question now is how to speed up the pace and scale of forest restoration and mitigate devastating wildfires."", 'Given that this is an incredibly complex and systemic set of issues, two avenues we can use to address wildfire mitigation include: 1) Data and 2) Management. This is where Cisco Foundation grant partner Vibrant Planet Data Commons comes in. VP Data Commons seeks to transform how our forests are managed by combining high-quality data packages with real-world stories from the forests themselves, with a particular focus on illustrating the many benefits of Indigenous forest practices.', ""Let's start with data. When it comes to forest ecology and fire science, scientists and governments are generating excellent data, such as how much a forest has departed from its natural state, but to make that data accessible to decision makers can take significant time and resources. Once the data is collected, its proprietor may not have the capacity or tools to share the data in easily accessible ways or to do widespread storytelling, and certainly not to take the actions suggested by the data, such as restoration or preservation. Data around things like the overgrowth of forest understory and density of trees can be hard to generate in bulk while also being accurate at the local level, and it is often not collected with enough frequency nor promptly released to meet needs of the quickly changing climate crisis, or its resolution may be low."", ""VP Data Commons' solution is to be that missing link: they support data collection with innovative solutions, like High Altitude Balloons, often used for scientific exploration like making Earth or atmospheric observations, and in consultation from entities such as the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), they make it easy for scientists to share out their own data. VP Data Commons then serves as a repository for high-quality data packages, such as wildfire risk in the Yuba Watershed of California. Not only does VP Data Commons take the lead in this curation, but they also provide tutorials on using that data in other scientific analyses and in applying it to real world restoration efforts which addresses our second avenue: management."", 'Long before European settlers arrived in what is now more commonly known as the United States, Indigenous people stewarded forests with a wide variety of sophisticated management techniques, including carefully planned intentional burns (known as ""healthy fire""), for example. Even with high quality and usable data, many current forest management and restoration efforts led by public and private entities still face problems of cohesion and are typically disconnected from previous and highly successful Indigenous forest-stewardship practices.', 'The depth and breadth of forest management practices in Indigenous communities is diverse, as are the ways by which such land stewards share their stories with the public. Recently, we had the privilege of hearing from Ray Entz, the Director of Wildlife and Terrestrial Resources at the Kalispel Tribe, and an Advisor to VP Data Commons. In his words:', '""Indigenous communities are far more sophisticated and ready to lead the design and implementation of large-scale forest restoration projects than previously recognized. Where partnerships and collaboration opportunities exist, Tribes can be powerful partners to large public land managers and communities that want to restore their forest ecosystems.""', 'This Tribal leadership and partnership for restoration is so vital because, according to Ray: ""We\'re already seeing climate impacts that are stressing our forests and leading to significant changes. For example, many culturally important species, such as Western red cedar, are in steep decline.""', 'The Kalispel Tribe is leading the recovery of 45,000 acres of forest in the Pacific Northwest, and in partnership with VP Data Commons, is developing data visualizations that will help policy makers and the public better understand, support, and prioritize Tribal land management. VP Data Commons seeks to support and uplift these vivid success stories and - with reciprocity and sensitivity - share with the world how data and Tribal stewardship can lead to resiliency in communities, forests, and ecosystems at large.', ""In today's world where deep healing and forest restoration are needed to avoid destructive fires, sequester carbon into thriving ecosystems, and improve livelihoods of local communities, a single shared vision is instrumental. Dynamic, reciprocal, and innovative partnerships between entities such as nonprofit organizations, Tribal communities, governments, and scientists have the potential to provide high-impact, fast-acting forest restoration. These partnerships are not just possible, they are actively happening, with the Kalispel Tribe and VP Data Commons setting a harmonious example. Tying together all of these successful efforts, of course, is our dear friend: data."", 'VP Data Commons and the Cisco Foundation share a similar vision where data is accessible and actionable, efforts are connected, and important voices are in the room where decisions are made, which - when all combined - can bring about the inclusive future we all strive for. In this context, it means more healthy fire and less extreme fire. It means we collectively value, honor, and center traditional Indigenous practices to be the main forest management paradigm. If you are a scientist with data getting stale, a funder seeking opportunities to support, or an tech expert looking to lend your skills, you can get in touch with Vibrant Planet Data Commons.', 'As Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer, distinguished professor, scientist, enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, and Director of the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment, wisely says:', '""To love a place is not enough.
