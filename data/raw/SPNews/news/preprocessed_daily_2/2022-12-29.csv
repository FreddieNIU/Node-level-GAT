2,916f4e80-be9e-3bf8-ae8e-b25756df2836,SCHW,2022-12-29,12 Best Life Insurance Companies,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-life-insurance-companies-175238966.html,1672249958,STORY,"['NRDS', 'SCHW', 'PRU', 'MET-PE', 'LNC']","[In this article, we take a look at the 12 best life insurance companies. You can skip our detailed analysis of the insurance industry and go directly to 5 Best Life Insurance Companies.The global life insurance industry is experiencing a slowdown due to the ongoing economic downturn. It is especially true for term-life policies since high inflation risks decreasing the death benefit. Regardless, the industry is grounded across the world, and especially in the US, with three in four Americans having some sort of life insurance policy according to a Forbes survey. The life insurance industry has grown at a relatively faster pace in the developing world, with the expansion of its middle class. Figures from McKinsey show that the developing world has added 52% in the growth of global premium in the past decade. Industry AnalysisMcKinsey’s 2023 Insurance report shows a significant gap between economic growth and premium growth around the world. For instance, the US and the EU had a nominal GDP growth at a CAGR of 5% in the past 20 years. However, life insurance premiums grew at a CAGR of only 2%. There are several reasons for this. The most important one being the problem of cost base. Cost, as a share of revenue, has increased by 23% in the life insurance industry since 2003. For comparison, it has only increased by 5% in the Property and Casualty Insurance industry. This, combined with high earnings-volatility, low performance mobility and risk opacity has largely driven investors away from the industry. This trend is reflected in the life-insurance industry's market cap in the US relative to other financial services. It decreased from 40% in 1985 to 17% in 2005, to just 9% in 2020. However, some new trends might change things for the better. For example, numerous life insurance companies have moved away from affiliated distribution due to increased commoditization of the insurance products. Affiliated distributors have lost the market by 4% in the past decade, per the iii.org. Conversely, independent distributors have gained popularity, with their market share increasing from 44% in 2012 to 50% in 2021. The trend is smoothed out across the world. Story continuesAnother key statistic from iii.org reveals that traditional life insurance has also lost mainstream popularity in favor of life/annuity policies, which made up 48% of premiums written in the year 2021. Future OutlookAccording to Research and Markets, the global life insurance market is expected to grow at a modest CAGR of 4.4% and reach $3.5 trillion in value by 2025. Further, it is projected to reach $4.2 trillion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.7% during the forecast period of 2025-2030.The growth is mainly going to be driven by transforming technologies like AI and Big Data, allowing for highly personalized policies. Personalized life insurance is expected to greatly transform the industry since different people have different needs that are hard to pin down in a few categories. Traditionally, life insurance coverage has been estimated using Needs-Approach, and while it does account for unique needs of different individuals, it does not offer nearly the same level of detail that can be achieved using Big Data and AI. The industry is already adapting, with AI startups like Loadsure, Concirrus and Sherpa. As far as industry players go, some of the most prominent companies in the life insurance industry are MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) and State Farm. In the case of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), it offers term, universal, indexed universal and variable-universal life insurance policies.Below, we list the 12 best life insurance companies.12 Best Life Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 12 best life insurance companies, we’ve identified the consensus picks from Investopedia, US News, Forbes Advisor and Nerdwallet that rated insurance companies from 1 to 5 stars.

Mutual of Omaha has some unique offerings like Return-of-Premium-Term-Insurance as well as a disability-income rider. It also offers at-least two accelerated death-benefit riders for the majority of its policies. A drawback is that the company does not offer whole-life insurance and variable-universal life insurance policies. When it comes to term policies of the company, these vary from 10-year to 30-year terms. Mutual of Omaha has two term-life products, namely, Term-Life Answers and Term-Life Express. The latter does not require a medical exam.11. Protective LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.8 AM Best Grade: A+Protective Life is an Alabama-based life insurance company that is highly regarded for its term-life policies.

One of its advantages, on the other hand, is no upfront costs for some of its living-benefit riders. There are six available riders from Lincoln Financial Group. Three of these are accelerated death benefits for terminal, critical and chronic illnesses. Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) is one of the top names alongside MetLife, Inc.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology.  Computer technology is the backbone of the modern world. Ever since Charles Babbage started tinkering around with what was called the Difference Engine in 1822 and Konrad Zuse built the Z3 in 1938, computing has improved by leaps and bounds. A simple example of this fact is that some of the first computers weighed as much as 70 kilograms, and today's most advanced processor has transistors that are as small as 3 nanometers. For reference, a single human hair is thought to be as thick as 100,000 nanometers.Much of the advancement in the modern day computing era has come through hardware innovation. Semiconductors, which have become one of the most prized products in the world, are the chips that power devices such as smartphones and laptops. These owe their origins to a flurry of developments that took place in the United States in the 1970s. In fact, the U.S. Navy can very well be said to have developed the world's first chip, when it teamed up with Garrett AiResearch to develop a computer for the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet. At the same time, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Intel 4004 and a similar product from Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) were also taking shape. From then until now, billions of microprocessors have been produced, and the rest is history.While the microprocessor is the heart of computer technology, since no computer can run without it, the field itself involves a variety of other subsystems as well. These include, but are not limited to random access memory (RAM), storage, monitors, display units, peripherals, routers, power management devices, signals processors, and brackets. The industry itself is one of the largest in the world, and according to the research firm The Business Research Company, the global information technology market was worth a whopping $8.3 trillion in 2020. That's right folks, IT is more valuable than crude oil in today's world. By the end of 2022, due in just a couple of days, the research firm expects that the IT industry will be worth another stunning $9.3 trillion.Story continuesHowever, even though IT has taken the world by storm, its days are numbered. The physical limit of microprocessors is fast approaching, which in simple terms means that after 2-nanometer and maybe 1-nanometer, hardware will stop advancing. Major chipmakers such as Intel and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) aim to start producing 2-nanometer chips in 2025, so perhaps the end of computing advancement might be with us by the end of this decade.The 'end' of traditional computing of course. Even as silicon-based chips are at their peak, quantum computing is only starting. While a traditional computer makes billions of on/off or 0/1 calculations by turning its transistors on or off, a quantum computer is not limited to these binary states and therefore is able to deliver vastly superior performance. In fact, while information technology is limited to an 11.2% CAGR, the quantum computing market on the other hand is believed to grow at an eye popping 31.2% CAGR between 2022 and 2029 to sit at $4.7 billion. In addition to Intel, some key players in the quantum computing market, with their own quantum computing chips are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI), and D-Wave Systems Inc. (NYSE:QBTS).12 Most Advanced Countries in Computer TechnologyCredit: IBMOur MethodologyWe used data from the OECD patent database to sift out the top computing technology countries in the world. The patents used are under the WIPO's Computing Technology filing category.12 Most Advanced Countries in Computer Technology12. Commonwealth of AustraliaNumber of Computer Technology Patents Between 1999 and 2019: 2,183The Commonwealth of Australia, or simply Australia, is the only country in the world that covers the mainland of an entire continent. Australia is a prosperous nation, with a GDP per capita of $62,192. It also spends billions of dollars on research expenditure every year. In fact, according to Accenture, the Australian technology sector contributes a whopping $167 billion to the economy of a country that has historically relied on its mining industry to fuel growth. Australians have contributed to WiFi and spectroscopy. Between 1999 and 2019, they scored 2,183 patents as well - despite the country ranking 53rd globally in terms of population.11. State of IsraelNumber of Computer Technology Patents Between 1999 and 2019: 2,450 The State of Israel is a Middle Eastern country that is one of the most technologically advanced in the region.

In fact, India has beaten China when it comes to Mars exploration, as its orbiter was the first to reach Mars and the first to do so on the first attempt. In terms of computing technology, Indians have invented a programming language, an antenna, and even microwave communication. Some Indian computer technology firms are Compuage Infocom Limited (NSE:COMPINFO.NS), HCL Infosystems Limited (NSE:HCL-INSYS.NS), Vintron Informatics Ltd., and Cerebra Integrated Technologies Limited (NSE:CEREBRAINT.BO). Indian computer technology patents were 4,179 between 1999 and 2019.9. Republic of China (ROC)Number of Computer Technology Patents Between 1999 and 2019: 4,216 The Republic of China (ROC), commonly known as Taiwan, is an island region in the South China sea that few countries recognize as a country. However, any mention of a list of top computing technology countries will simply be incomplete without it. This is due to the simple fact that Taiwan is home to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). Commonly known as TSMC, the company is the backbone of the modern day semiconductor fabrication. Most of its facilities are located in Taiwan, and its 3-nanometer chip manufacturing technology is one of the most advanced technologies in the world - catching with the chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) which has dominated the industry for decades.Taiwan also has other high end technology firms such as MediaTek Inc. (TPE:2454.TW) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:HNHPF) - with the latter being Apple's primary manufacturing partner and being responsible for making the world's iPhones.

So far this year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 48.8% compared with the industry’s 34.3% growth.What’s Favoring the Stock?The pricing scenario of natural gas is significantly healthier this year than last year. In its short-term energy outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) revealed its forecast of the Henry Hub spot average price in the first quarter of 2023 to be more than $6.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), higher than the commodity’s average price of $5.50/MMBtu for November. EIA stated that the healthier price is backed by increasing LNG export and improved demand for natural gas in winter. Being a leading producer of natural gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) in the United States, the massive improvement in the commodity price is a boon for Range Resources’ upstream operations.In Appalachia, RRC has decades of low-risk drilling inventory, brightening its production outlook. The company has lower well costs per lateral foot than many other upstream players.Range Resources has a strong focus on strengthening its balance sheet. Range Resources expects 2022 to be the fifth straight year of absolute debt reduction. On a positive note, the company has the lowest emission intensity among the upstream companies in the United States.RisksIn spite of the positive factors, RRC’s overall operations are significantly exposed to extreme oil and natural gas price volatility.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX, BP plc BP and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc.

DE, Atlas Corp. ATCO, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA and Unum Group UNM.Buy These 5 Stocks with Solid Sales Growth for the New YearWith the turbulent 2022 coming to an end, it’s time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for the New Year. While recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. So, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour, which will help generate solid returns. One such method is choosing stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Deere &amp; Co., Atlas Corp., First Citizens BancShares, Inc., LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Unum Group are worth a look.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more analyzed than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, persistent bottom-line growth usually requires robust sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn’t indicate much about a company’s prospects. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a sensible investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Story continuesHere are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Deere, based in Moline, IL, is the world’s largest producer of agricultural equipment.

8,6b464047-e64e-31ff-b217-2c8573b8599d,UNM,2022-12-29,4 Low P/CF Stocks to Navigate Market Volatility in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-p-cf-stocks-130801224.html,1672232881,STORY,"['UNM', 'AER']","[The year 2022 has not been benevolent enough toward investors, thanks to record-level inflation and geopolitical tensions. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine pushed commodity prices through the roof, leaving the Fed with no option but to raise the benchmark interest rate. Soaring inflation, higher cost of borrowings and the ongoing conflict have kept investors on their toes.Market pundits do not expect any drastic change in the economic scenario, at least in the first half of 2023. While the Fed’s recent action to lower the magnitude of the rate hike came as a breather, worries about a slowing economy prevail. So, while you modify your portfolio to cope with the changing market scenario and continued monetary policy tightening, market pundits are placing their bets on value stocks.Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks, but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, ASGN Incorporated ASGN, Unum Group UNM and AerCap Holdings N.V. AER boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, one of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Sterling Infrastructure, which is engaged in transportation, e-infrastructure, and building solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA.Industry: ApparelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2032969/5-textile-apparel-stocks-worth-a-watch-despite-rising-inflationPlayers in the Zacks Textile – Apparel industry continue to battle inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions. Rising selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, mainly due to higher freight and logistic costs, continue to hurt several companies in the space.That said, growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses coupled with effective brand enhancement techniques keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corporation, Columbia Sportswear Company, PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal in fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.Story continuesInternational Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates robust near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies.

The company has been in investors’ good books, owing to strength across Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as the international business. Its PVH+ plan bodes well.This led to the impressive third-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 47.8% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.9%.That said, let’s delve deeper into the factors that are aiding PVH. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Narrating PVH’s Growth StoryPVH Corp's diversified brand portfolio and continued momentum in its core brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, make it well-placed for long-term growth. The company's Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands continued to perform well in third-quarter fiscal 2022, driven by robust consumer demand.On a cc basis, Tommy Hilfiger revenues rose 7%, while Calvin Klein revenues grew 9% in the quarter. The Tommy Hilfiger brand gained from a strong product assortment, a partnership with Shawn Mendes, a recent fashion show at New York Fashion Week and a multi-verse Tommy Factory Runway experience, which launched its Tommy Hilfiger Monogram collection.Calvin Klein has been witnessing strong consumer engagement. It recently launched its platform CK.com in North America, which offers faster site speed and strong product imagery. Management remains confident about the underlying power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, which position the company's business to succeed amid the ever-changing consumer landscape.The company's international business continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, both on a year-over-year and pre-pandemic basis. The international unit’s revenues jumped 7% year over year on a cc basis, driven by product strength, solid consumer engagement amid the challenging environment in Europe, and COVID-19 restrictions in China. The region witnessed gains across markets in Europe, with the region exceeding $1 billion in sales in the quarter for the first time. Going ahead, management expects the international business to drive growth.It remains on track with its multi-year PVH+ Plan to drive sustainable growth. The plan mainly aims at accelerating growth by boosting its core strengths, and connecting the Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER brands with the consumers through five major drivers. These drivers are win with product; win with consumer engagement; win in the digitally-led marketplace; develop a demand- and data-driven operating model; and drive efficiencies and invest in growth.  PVH focuses on boosting efficiencies to be cost-competitive and, in turn, reinvest in strategic plans. In sync with its plans, the company remains on track to reduce 10% of its workforce in its global offices by the end of 2023. The move is likely to generate savings of more than $100 million, which will then be reinvested in digital, supply chain and consumer engagement related to the PVH+ Plan.In a recent development, as part of the PVH+ plan, PVH Corp announced the extension of its license agreements with G-III Apparel Group from 2025 to 2027. The deal will enable the smooth transition of core product categories back to PVH at the end of the extended terms. The transaction mainly includes Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands in the United States and Canada, particularly the women’s North American wholesale business.Management shared certain financial goals, which are to be achieved through the solid execution of the PVH+ Plan. It anticipates witnessing a high-single-digit CAGR rate from 2021 to $12.5 billion in revenues in 2025. Revenue drivers are balanced global growth from Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER; high-single-digit CAGR in Europe and the Americas; mid-teens CAGR in the Asia Pacific; 20% or more CAGR across digital platforms; and direct-to-consumer brick &amp; mortar exceeding wholesale brick &amp; mortar.PVH Corp expects its operating margin to grow to 15%, while the free cash flow is likely to be more than $1 billion in 2025.Story continuesHurdles on the WayPVH Corp has been reeling under ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war, such as Russia store closures, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and a reduction in wholesale shipments to Ukraine. This, along with COVID-led impacts in Asia, led to a sluggish year-over-year performance in the fiscal third quarter.Adjusted earnings of $2.60 per share fell 2.6% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $2.88 per share against earnings of $3.89 in the prior-year quarter. Revenues declined 2% year over year (up 7% on a cc basis) to $2,281 million.Higher costs and increased promotions also dented margins in the fiscal third quarter. The gross margin contracted 180 bps to 55.9%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $220 million compared with $266 million in the prior-year quarter.For fiscal 2022, revenues are anticipated to be at the higher end of the earlier mentioned year-over-year decrease of 3-4% (up 3-4% on a cc basis). This is inclusive of a 2% reduction each for the exit of the Heritage Brands Retail business and the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is expected to be $8.25 for the year, up from the $8.00 per share mentioned earlier. However, the company reported $10.15 last year.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, management expects a 4% year-over-year revenue decline. This is inclusive of a 2% decline from the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is likely to be 45 cents on a GAAP basis and $1.65 on an adjusted basis. Notably, the company reported $3.89 and $2.67 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 27 cents, as well as 15 cents of adverse impacts of the Ukraine war.Bottom LineAlthough the impacts of geopolitical conflict and high costs are near-term headwinds, we believe that strength in core brands and the international unit, and gains from the PVH+ Plan will help the stock sustain its momentum. A long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2% raise optimism in the stock. PVH’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2022 have moved up 4.3% in the past 30 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, RCI Hospitality Holdings RICK and Hyatt Hotels H.Hilton Grand Vacations currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Rising selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, mainly due to higher freight and logistic costs, continue to hurt several companies in the space.That said, growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses coupled with effective brand enhancement techniques keep Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal in fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates robust near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies.

But I think everyone sort of knows that. I mean, one of the issues that Best Buy is dealing with, aside from the macroeconomic headwinds, is the fact that you did have this very significant demand pull forward in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic,"" Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).Indeed, most signs point to a lackluster fourth quarter from the electronics retailer.November retail sales disappointed the market, with pressure seen in big-ticket categories such as electronics.Separate data this week, from Mastercard's SpendingPulse report, found that sales of electronics fell 5.3% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24. The category saw the second-worst sales performance this holiday season, just behind a 5.4% drop for jewelry.“Inflation altered the way U.S. consumers approached their holiday shopping – from hunting for the best deals to making trade-offs that stretched gift-giving budgets,” Mastercard North America chief economist Michelle Meyer said.Best Buy itself entered the holidays with minimal sales momentum, at best.Same-store sales fell in almost all lines of the business in the third quarter. Profit margins tanked in both Best Buy's domestic and international segments. U.S. and international same-store sales fell 10.5% and 9.3%, respectively, in the third quarter.Shares of Best Buy are down 21% year to date.While Chukumba is cautious on Best Buy's near-term results, the question is whether all recent related bad news is priced into the stock. The long-time retail watcher thinks Best Buy's stock valuation has perhaps reached a trough.""Now, here's the good news in terms of Best Buy shareholders. That's [a bad fourth quarter] more than priced into the stock, particularly at current valuation levels. So I don't think that Best Buy having a tough holiday selling season is going to be a big surprise to anyone,"" Chukumba said.Story continuesA shopper pushes a cart with a TV in front of a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 25, 2022.

""And this really was Custer's Last Stand. It's going to pretty much end up the same way that it did for Custer.

(Photo by Carl D. Walsh/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)To be sure, not many on Wall Street would be shocked if the 2022 holiday season were to be Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's last.The retailer has battled all year long with tanking sales, weak store traffic, low cash levels, and merchandise not aligned with customer tastes. Earlier this year, the board ousted Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's turnaround CEO Mark Tritton. Other execs have also fled as cash-saving, cost-cutting efforts are underway.Furthermore, new CEO Sue Gove hasn't been able to revive the company, which has been heavily discounting products this holiday season in an effort to raise badly needed cash.Comparable store sales crashed 26% from a year prior in the fiscal second quarter as the economic slowdown and poor inventory quality weighed on store traffic. The challenged top line and increased discounting led to the company posting an operating loss of $168 million in the quarter.Not helping sentiment is that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond may have had a very ugly holiday shopping season as it continues to battle execution issues and more cautious shoppers.U.S. web traffic for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond dropped a startling 19% in November, according to new research from Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski. The declines worsened from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday with a drop of about 25% versus the prior year.Story continuesMeanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock has plunged 83% in 2022, badly underperforming the S&amp;P 500's 20% drop.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2022.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that represents the performance of 30 large, publicly traded companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and most widely followed stock market indices in the world. It was first published in 1896 and has since become a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market. The index is calculated based on the stock prices of the 30 companies that make up the index, with each company's weight in the index determined by its market capitalization (the total value of its outstanding shares).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is often used as a barometer of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. The index has provided a total return of -9.3% YTD (including dividends reinvested), which reflects the worsening health of the US economy in 2022 as the FED continues to raise interest rates. The current year will mark a year of negative performance after three consecutive years of strong positive returns in 2019, 2020, and 2021.The 30 component stocks of the DJIA are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, and they are chosen based on the overall importance of the companies to the economy and the stock market. The index is reconstituted often as new companies are added while the older ones get replaced. The most recent reconstitution in the index occurred in 2020 when companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) were added to the index, while Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) were removed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has provided a YTD total return of -9.3% compared with -34.4% provided by the Nasdaq and -18.0% provided by the S&amp;P 500. The Defensive sector which comprises 29.49% of the total weightage of the Dow, may be a reason why the index performed better than others in the current year.

(WMT): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-walmart-inc-140002009.html,1672236002,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share, indicating a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $158.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $605.64 billion and $623.76 billion estimates indicate +5.7% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA.Industry: ApparelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2032969/5-textile-apparel-stocks-worth-a-watch-despite-rising-inflationPlayers in the Zacks Textile – Apparel industry continue to battle inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions. Rising selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, mainly due to higher freight and logistic costs, continue to hurt several companies in the space.That said, growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses coupled with effective brand enhancement techniques keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corporation, Columbia Sportswear Company, PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal in fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.Story continuesInternational Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

24,d4c1909f-4143-3cd1-abdb-f8c5cb5e6caa,UAA,2022-12-29,Under Armour’s strategy ‘will not change that much’ with new CEO: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/under-armour-strategy-not-change-170250247.html,1672246970,VIDEO,"['UA', 'UAA']","[Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the task ahead for Under Armour’s new CEO, the categories the athletic apparel company plays in, inventory issues, and opportunities to take market share.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Let's get under the hood of Under Armour now. Shares in the retailer down over 50% since the start of the year, as it deals with a variety of headwinds from an inventory glut, fierce competition from Nike and Adidas and Lululemon, and a costly courtroom battle with the UCLA.The bright spot for the coming year might well be incoming CEO Stephanie Linnartz, who's currently president over at Marriott. Though athletic apparel certainly fresh terrain for the new boss, her focus said to be boosting the group's digital offering. Joining us to discuss is David Schwartz, equity analyst at Morningstar. David, good to see you here. What are the top three moves you want to see from Stephanie coming out of the gate here?DAVID SWARTZ: I think there's a lot of focus on the digital strategy and on a loyalty program, getting more people to download Under Armour's apps and getting more connected to the consumer. I think there's also a focus on inventory levels and the supply chain, which has been a work in progress for Under Armour for the last few years. I think that's another high top priority.And then another one would really be the product and increasing distribution. Under Armour is strong in some areas. They're weaker in other areas like footwear. There is a lot of opportunity, I think, for Under Armour to increase its distribution to retailers like Foot Locker, which have lost some Nike product and that may present an opening for Under Armour's footwear.JULIE HYMAN: David, though, is CEO of Under Armour sort of, for lack of a better word, a doomed position, given the dominance of Kevin Plank, of course, the founder and chairman at the company? Is it really going to be a tough job for, really, anyone who would have stepped into that role?Story continuesDAVID SWARTZ: It is problematic, yes, because Kevin Plank is still the controlling shareholder. He's still very influential with the company. And the way that Patrick Frisk was dismissed earlier this year doesn't exactly bode well for an outsider CEO coming into Under Armour.But one of the benefits that the new CEO seems to have is that she worked with the Marriott family at Marriott, so she does have experience in working with a controlling family, and that could help at Under Armour. I don't think that she'll be able to change the strategy very much. Under Armour has really been in restructuring mode for about five or six years. And that's really not going to change that much under a new CEO.BRAD SMITH: Is the sentiment around Under Armour from a consumer perspective waning, remaining strong? What can they do to really prop up or engage that next wave of consumers, as even across lifestyle and performance, there seems to be even within the existing categorical players in athletic apparel and footwear, there seems to be a strategic approach that a lot of the competitors have to both of those categories, whereas Under Armour has largely been just in the performance category?DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah, that's true. So Under Armour, for many years, has resisted complaints from the analysts and shareholders that it should really be getting more into athleisure and more casual sportswear. Now for a long time, Under Armour resisted that and said they would strictly focus on performance sportswear. Now recently, however, they have suggested they're going to release more casual product. And that will be something for the new CEO to handle.But Under Armour does face a lot of competition there. There are so many strong athleisure companies like Lululemon and others that you've mentioned. And they really have a better market position right now than Under Armour does. So it's going to be a long time, really, before Under Armour becomes a major player in that area. I think Under Armour does have a strong customer base among youth, high school athletes, college athletes. That's really the strength of the company, is the teenager and college age market.BRIAN SOZZI: And David, from what I can tell, the only line, apparel line inside of Under Armour that seems to be selling well consistently is anything made by the Rock. And I think the argument could be made that they have not utilized his brand pretty much at all. The products are constantly out of stock. Does Stephanie to reach out to him, and maybe they need to be doing more with someone like that?DAVID SWARTZ: Under Armour has had trouble managing its inventory over the years. They've had trouble with their supply chain. So yeah, there have been times when they've been sold out of things. Under Armour has a large wholesale operation, so they don't have necessarily great control over their product as much as Nike does, which has a much larger direct-to-consumer business, for example.So it makes it tough for Under Armour because they're dependent on orders from wholesale partners. And a lot of their own sales are really through discount channels through outlet stores. Under Armour does not have a lot of great full price retail sales of its own. And that's one thing that Under Armour will need to work on. And it doesn't have the partnerships. You mentioned the Rock, but it doesn't have the partnerships that Nike and Adidas have. And that's one of its problems.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and so within that digital strategy that you would put in your top three things that they need to work on, or at least that the new CEO needs to prioritize, how do you really prop up that digital strategy or drive some of the demand digitally when you don't have those other things that your competitors do?DAVID SWARTZ: I think Under Armour does need to upgrade its product, offer a more diverse product line, more than just focus on, like, college football, which is sort of Under Armour's best known category. They're known for high school and college football. They need to diversify a little bit, try to get more into the collector market, maybe sign some new athletes. Under Armour's marketing strategy really has changed more than once over the last few years. So it's not really clear what it is all the time.I mean, that's something that Under Armour really needs to nail down. But I do think that the company has fans. It's still a company with $6 billion in sales. They have opportunities outside of the US, especially in China, which is expected to be the largest sportswear market, certainly the fastest growing one. And Under Armour really needs to improve its international focus, too. It's not just the US consumer.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I would have expected to see some limited edition colorways of Steph Curry's old shoes, the best selling ones at least, and some of the utilization of the other athletes that they've been very popular with and have courted in the past. David, a pleasure to have this conversation with you. We're all going to see how they perform in 2023. David Swartz, equity analyst over at Morningstar, we appreciate it.]"

The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Micron Technology MU, STMicroelectronics STM, Microchip Technology MCHP and Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Forget Micron (MU): Buy These 4 Semiconductor Stocks InsteadMicron Technology’s shares have plunged 46.3% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s declines of 36% and 20.6%, respectively. Though the broader market sell-off has somewhat affected the stock’s performance, the main reasons behind this slump are company-specific.The company is suffering from dampened memory-chip demand, as customers are adjusting inventories in response to macroeconomic headwinds like supply-chain issues for certain components, negatively impacting bit shipments in the near term, and possible fear of economic recession.Micron kicked off fiscal 2023 on a disappointing note, registering year-over-year declines of 101.9% and 46.8% in its first-quarter earnings and revenues, respectively. The company registered sales declines in almost all of its end markets on a quarter-over-quarter basis. MU cited rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across all of its end markets as the reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Such a scenario is likely to further dim the Idaho-headquartered leading semiconductor memory solution provider’s financial performance in the next few quarters. Micron’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue guidance of $3.80 billion (+/- $200 million) indicates a year-over-year loss of 51%. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s adjusted loss per share projection of 62 cents (+/-10 cents) indicates a year-over-year decline of 129%.Story continuesMicron’s heavy dependence on China is anticipated to keep the company under pressure in the near term. Given that the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest importer, the persistent tit-for-tat trade war between the nations poses a threat to the company.Last week, Micron disclosed a restructuring plan to reduce its headcount by 10% throughout 2023 in response to the technology industry slowdown that is affecting employment conditions. The company decided to reduce staff through voluntary attrition or layoffs to prepare for the potential recession and Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes. It is, therefore, advisable to stay away from this semiconductor maker in the near term.3 Semiconductor Stocks to Bet onThough Micron’s prospects might not appear appealing, there are some other stocks in the semiconductor industry that offer good investment opportunities right now.

29,93b4ed0e-d189-371c-8812-83c9a95fbfcb,MCHP,2022-12-29,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-microchip-technology-141359757.html,1672236839,STORY,['MCHP'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.84bUS$2.97bUS$3.03bUS$3.38bUS$3.35bUS$3.36bUS$3.38bUS$3.41bUS$3.46bUS$3.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 0.07%Est @ 0.64%Est @ 1.04%Est @ 1.32%Est @ 1.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.0%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$20bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$40b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$69.0, the company appears about fair value at a 6.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microchip Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.313. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Microchip TechnologyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries about a global economic recovery.Year to date (YTD), the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 have plunged 8.5%, 33.8% and 19.7%, respectively.

Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 29% of its value YTD.However, this sell-off in the broader equity market has led to a massive correction in several technology companies’ stock prices, which were considered to be widely overvalued at the sector’s peak in 2021. With this correction, several tech stocks are currently trading way below their 52-week high and at attractive valuations as well, despite their strong fundamentals.In our opinion, Microchip Technology MCHP, ePlus PLUS and GlobalFoundries GFS are among the most beaten-down stocks in the technology space.

31,916f4e80-be9e-3bf8-ae8e-b25756df2836,MET,2022-12-29,12 Best Life Insurance Companies,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-life-insurance-companies-175238966.html,1672249958,STORY,"['NRDS', 'SCHW', 'PRU', 'MET-PE', 'LNC']","[In this article, we take a look at the 12 best life insurance companies. You can skip our detailed analysis of the insurance industry and go directly to 5 Best Life Insurance Companies.The global life insurance industry is experiencing a slowdown due to the ongoing economic downturn. It is especially true for term-life policies since high inflation risks decreasing the death benefit. Regardless, the industry is grounded across the world, and especially in the US, with three in four Americans having some sort of life insurance policy according to a Forbes survey. The life insurance industry has grown at a relatively faster pace in the developing world, with the expansion of its middle class. Figures from McKinsey show that the developing world has added 52% in the growth of global premium in the past decade. Industry AnalysisMcKinsey’s 2023 Insurance report shows a significant gap between economic growth and premium growth around the world. For instance, the US and the EU had a nominal GDP growth at a CAGR of 5% in the past 20 years. However, life insurance premiums grew at a CAGR of only 2%. There are several reasons for this. The most important one being the problem of cost base. Cost, as a share of revenue, has increased by 23% in the life insurance industry since 2003. For comparison, it has only increased by 5% in the Property and Casualty Insurance industry. This, combined with high earnings-volatility, low performance mobility and risk opacity has largely driven investors away from the industry. This trend is reflected in the life-insurance industry's market cap in the US relative to other financial services. It decreased from 40% in 1985 to 17% in 2005, to just 9% in 2020. However, some new trends might change things for the better. For example, numerous life insurance companies have moved away from affiliated distribution due to increased commoditization of the insurance products. Affiliated distributors have lost the market by 4% in the past decade, per the iii.org. Conversely, independent distributors have gained popularity, with their market share increasing from 44% in 2012 to 50% in 2021. The trend is smoothed out across the world. Story continuesAnother key statistic from iii.org reveals that traditional life insurance has also lost mainstream popularity in favor of life/annuity policies, which made up 48% of premiums written in the year 2021. Future OutlookAccording to Research and Markets, the global life insurance market is expected to grow at a modest CAGR of 4.4% and reach $3.5 trillion in value by 2025. Further, it is projected to reach $4.2 trillion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.7% during the forecast period of 2025-2030.The growth is mainly going to be driven by transforming technologies like AI and Big Data, allowing for highly personalized policies. Personalized life insurance is expected to greatly transform the industry since different people have different needs that are hard to pin down in a few categories. Traditionally, life insurance coverage has been estimated using Needs-Approach, and while it does account for unique needs of different individuals, it does not offer nearly the same level of detail that can be achieved using Big Data and AI. The industry is already adapting, with AI startups like Loadsure, Concirrus and Sherpa. As far as industry players go, some of the most prominent companies in the life insurance industry are MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) and State Farm. In the case of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), it offers term, universal, indexed universal and variable-universal life insurance policies.Below, we list the 12 best life insurance companies.12 Best Life Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 12 best life insurance companies, we’ve identified the consensus picks from Investopedia, US News, Forbes Advisor and Nerdwallet that rated insurance companies from 1 to 5 stars. We've ranked companies based on number of positive ratings, with their mean score being the tiebreaker. We've factored-in the AM Best grading for companies' financial stability in our ranking, as the most important metric. AM Best is a credit rating agency specializing in insurance companies that grades their financial stength from A++ to S, with grade A++ indicating the highest level of financial strength and S representing the lowest.Here are the 12 best life insurance companies:12. Mutual of OmahaNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.7 AM Best Grade: A+Mutual of Omaha is 12th on our list of best life insurance companies. Mutual of Omaha has some unique offerings like Return-of-Premium-Term-Insurance as well as a disability-income rider. It also offers at-least two accelerated death-benefit riders for the majority of its policies. A drawback is that the company does not offer whole-life insurance and variable-universal life insurance policies. When it comes to term policies of the company, these vary from 10-year to 30-year terms. Mutual of Omaha has two term-life products, namely, Term-Life Answers and Term-Life Express. The latter does not require a medical exam.11. Protective LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.8 AM Best Grade: A+Protective Life is an Alabama-based life insurance company that is highly regarded for its term-life policies. It has a rating of 4.6 stars on Investopedia and 5 stars on Forbes Advisor. Protective Life is one of the few life insurance companies that provides up to 40-year coverage in term-life policies. The coverage amounts anywhere from $0.1 million to $50 million. It also provides options to switch to permanent policies without the requirement of a medical examination.10. Pacific LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 5 AM Best Grade: A+Pacific Life is based in Newport Beach, California. It provides life insurance policies like term, whole and permanent life insurance, as well as annuities, pension plans and investment options in mutual funds. The company has a 5-star rating on Forbes Advisor for good performance in cash-value growth, cost competitiveness and reliability of policy illustrations. Pacific Life also has a 5-star rating on Nerdwallet, with its indexed universal life insurance mentioned as one of the best for growing investments based on indexes like S&amp;P 500. These policies come with a guarantee that the company will maintain the principal sum even if the stock market takes a nosedive. 9. Lincoln Financial GroupNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.4 AM Best Grade: A+Lincoln Financial Group is one of the best insurance companies according to various ratings. It is owned and operated by Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC). It has a rating of 3.9 stars on US News, 4.3 stars on Investopedia and a 5-star rating on Forbes Advisor. Lincoln Financial Group offers term life and universal life insurance policies. One of the disadvantages with Lincoln Financial Group is that it does not offer whole life insurance. One of its advantages, on the other hand, is no upfront costs for some of its living-benefit riders. There are six available riders from Lincoln Financial Group. Three of these are accelerated death benefits for terminal, critical and chronic illnesses. Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) is one of the top names alongside MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) when it comes to publicly traded insurance companies. 8. NationwideNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.5 AM Best Grade: A+Nationwide requires no medical exam for coverage of up to $5 million. It also includes at-least three living benefits in most of its life insurance policies. Nationwide is also one of the best insurance companies when it comes to customer satisfaction. Its 2021 NAIC index is 0.05, implying that it received far fewer than baseline complaints from policyholders than many other insurance companies. Another feature that sets the company apart is its variety of life insurance policies. Nationwide offers term, whole, universal, indexed universal, simplified whole, variable life and final-expense life insurance policies. It has eight riders including benefits for chronic, critical and terminal illnesses. 7. USAANumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.5 AM Best Grade: A++USAA is one of the best life insurance companies according to US News and Nerdwallet, where it has ratings of 4.1 and 5 respectively. It provides term, whole and universal life insurance policies. Unlike its other policies, which are exclusive to military members and their families, its life insurance policies are available for regular US citizens and green card holders. However, USAA provides additional perks to military members in their life insurance policies as well, such as expediting their application if they’re being deployed.USAA is owned by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is diversified across financial services apart from insurance services unlike Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), which is entirely concentrated in the insurance industry. 6. New York LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.2 AM Best Grade: A++New York Life is the third largest insurance company in the US. It has a rating of 3.7 stars on the US News, 4 stars on Investopedia and a 5-star rating on Nerdwallet.  New York Life offers term, whole, universal and variable-universal life insurance policies. It offers a huge selection of policy riders and even offers policies for 90-year olds. The company also offers flexible payment options on some of its whole-life insurance policies, enabling policyholders to pay off their premiums earlier. Nerdwallet describes the company as the best for high coverage amounts. An attractive feature about New York Life’s whole-life insurance policies is that policyholders are eligible for annual dividends by the company and New York Life has consecutively paid dividends for 168 years, owing to its financial strength. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Insurance Companies.   Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions10 Biggest Fixed Income ETFs in America10 Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: none. 12 Best Insurance Companies is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

From January 5, the US will require passengers travelling from China, Hong Kong or Macao to have a negative test result.It joins India, Italy, Japan and Taiwan in imposing restrictions on travellers coming from China after the country's decision to lift Covid lockdowns triggered a surge in infections.Concerns over coronavirus cases have overshadowed hopes that the easing of lockdowns in China will boost demand for oil as its economy re-opens.Health officials are concerned that millions of people in China are likely being affected every day and the official figures from China may underestimate the true picture.""We have just limited information in terms of what's being shared related to the number of cases that are increasing, hospitalisations and especially deaths,” a US health official told a briefing. “There's been a decrease in testing across China so it also makes it difficult to know what the true infection rate is.”Oil prices jumped in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February amid concerns about disruption to supply from the world’s second largest oil exporter.They reached highs of $123.7 per barrel in March but have fallen steadily since June. Trading volumes this week were also light given the holiday period, creating more volatility in oil prices.Traders believe prices could yet rise, however, given Russia’s threats to stop selling oil to companies abiding by a $60 price cap on Russian oil introduced by G7 countries.“Next year brings immense uncertainty and plenty of potential upside risk for prices from the China reopening to lower Russian output and further OPEC+ cuts,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, told Reuters.In the UK, a tank of petrol now costs an average 151.77 pence per litre, while diesel costs 174.54 pence per litre, down from highs above 190 pence per litre in July.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan StanleyThe insider, Eric Grossman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$84.46). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.All up, insiders sold more shares in Morgan Stanley than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Morgan Stanley insiders own about US$373m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Morgan Stanley Insiders?The fact that there have been no Morgan Stanley insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Morgan Stanley insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Morgan Stanley has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Omnicom Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.8% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Omnicom Group, it has a TSR of 37% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Omnicom Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 14% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 6%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Omnicom Group   you should know about.Of course Omnicom Group may not be the best stock to buy.

From January 5, the US will require passengers travelling from China, Hong Kong or Macao to have a negative test result.It joins India, Italy, Japan and Taiwan in imposing restrictions on travellers coming from China after the country's decision to lift Covid lockdowns triggered a surge in infections.Concerns over coronavirus cases have overshadowed hopes that the easing of lockdowns in China will boost demand for oil as its economy re-opens.Health officials are concerned that millions of people in China are likely being affected every day and the official figures from China may underestimate the true picture.""We have just limited information in terms of what's being shared related to the number of cases that are increasing, hospitalisations and especially deaths,” a US health official told a briefing. “There's been a decrease in testing across China so it also makes it difficult to know what the true infection rate is.”Oil prices jumped in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February amid concerns about disruption to supply from the world’s second largest oil exporter.They reached highs of $123.7 per barrel in March but have fallen steadily since June. Trading volumes this week were also light given the holiday period, creating more volatility in oil prices.Traders believe prices could yet rise, however, given Russia’s threats to stop selling oil to companies abiding by a $60 price cap on Russian oil introduced by G7 countries.“Next year brings immense uncertainty and plenty of potential upside risk for prices from the China reopening to lower Russian output and further OPEC+ cuts,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, told Reuters.In the UK, a tank of petrol now costs an average 151.77 pence per litre, while diesel costs 174.54 pence per litre, down from highs above 190 pence per litre in July.]"

Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.Story continuesInternational Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance.

Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Marathon Oil's (NYSE:MRO) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Marathon Oil is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$18b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Marathon Oil has an ROCE of 23%. On its own, that's a very good return and it's on par with the returns earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Marathon Oil compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Marathon Oil here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe're delighted to see that Marathon Oil is reaping rewards from its investments and has now broken into profitability. Historically the company was generating losses but as we can see from the latest figures referenced above, they're now earning 23% on their capital employed. At first glance, it seems the business is getting more proficient at generating returns, because over the same period, the amount of capital employed has reduced by 27%. The reduction could indicate that the company is selling some assets, and considering returns are up, they appear to be selling the right ones.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayFrom what we've seen above, Marathon Oil has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Since the stock has returned a solid 56% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Marathon Oil (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Of the three indexes, the NASDAQ 100 has fared the worst, declining 33.8% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating recession fears. The founder of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates, Louis Navellier, also commented on how over low volumes, the equity market is trying its best to maintain its “head above water after a disappointing start to the official Santa Claus rally.” The billionaire investor thinks that since the hardest-hit industries are engaging in some bottom fishing, there has been some regression to the mean.As per the National Association of Realtors, pending home sales decreased by 4.0% on a monthly basis in November. These statistics were among the economic data released on December 28. The decline occurred due to prospective buyers being concerned about high mortgage rates. A loss of 1.8% had been predicted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. According to Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, there are unmistakable signals that the economy is faltering, as indicated by pending home sales plummeting to the second-lowest level in history. Historically, the sale of new homes has been a significant catalyst for economic activity because it supports numerous industries.Despite the current bearish economic environment, numerous mid to large-capitalization companies recorded significant trading volumes over the last three months. Investors have had various reasons to engage in active trading of companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Online trading platforms like Robinhood have also piqued the interest of investors in trading stocks as the platform offers commission-free trades.

(NYSE:PFE)Average 3-Month Volume: 21.29 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 77Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical and biotech giant. The company came into the limelight after developing the COVID-19 vaccine.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) intends to roll out first-of-its-kind vaccines to combat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The company also plans to launch a flu vaccine that leverages the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine delivery mechanism. Furthermore, 2023 will be the first year the COVID-19 vaccine will be available widely on the commercial market. Previously, the availability of COVID-19 was covered by public institutions and inter-governmental agencies. The positive sentiment on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock was reverberated by Chris Shibutani at Goldman Sachs. The analyst upgraded the stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating and also increased the target price from $47 to $60 on December 13.Diamond Hill Capital discussed its stance on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Labs, global pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG). Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Average 3-Month Volume: 24.37 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco, California-based tech company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.The company has a 70% market share in the US ride-hailing industry. Despite making significant progress in achieving higher growth and profitability, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stock is currently trading 40% below its IPO price. The company holds a total addressable market (TAM) of $13.8 trillion, with mobility and delivery businesses having a TAM of $5 trillion each, while Uber Freight has a TAM of $3.8 trillion. The rising inflation is also expected to increase the demand for ride-hailing services as it would become more challenging for people to buy cars. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is focusing on generating consistent cash flows through the introduction of subscription-based Uber One services. Despite the weakness in stock price performance, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has experienced a stellar 26% YoY growth in gross bookings during Q3 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Funds shared its stance on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Here’s what the firm said:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”10. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Average 3-Month Volume: 25.96 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is an Hangzhou, China-based diversified technology company founded in 1999 with a significant presence in the fields of cloud computing services, e-commerce, and social media.On November 18, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stock was assigned a target price of $180 along with a Buy rating by Fawne Jiang at Benchmark following the Q2 FY23 results. The reopening of the Chinese economy and the ease of COVID-19-related restrictions in China will play favorably for the company. The Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) has announced that travelers would not be required to undergo quarantine from January 8. The Chinese New Year festivities are expected to start on January 22. Based on these developments, the analyst anticipates Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) to experience a growth in customer management revenue (CMR) as the reopening of the Chinese economy boosts demand.Here’s what Polen Capital said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the leading e-commerce company in China. The stock was weak over the quarter as they reported a quarterly revenue decline. The company has been heavily impacted by the continued covid-19 lockdowns throughout China and the aggressive rate increases and deteriorating outlook for China’s economy have weighed heavily on the stock. The share price has also been under pressure due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s plans to delist Chinese tech stocks in 2024 if they do not provide access to audit files.”9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Average 3-Month Volume: 30.55 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 269Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Seattle, Washington-based diversified technology company with exposure to consumer electronics, cloud computing services, computer hardware, and software.On December 24, Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley shortlisted the company as a top pick in the field of software. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to experience growth in the cloud, data management, and security sectors. The company has also emerged as a top candidate for acquiring the California-based open-source tool provider for cloud-computing infrastructure, HashiCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCP). Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also working on closing the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition deal that was announced in January 2022. This will provide a significant tailwind to the company’s gaming business.Here’s what TimesSquare Capital Management said about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops, licenses, and supports software solutions worldwide. Fiscal fourth quarter results were generally in line with consensus estimates, though profits missed slightly. While its Azure cloud business continues to perform well, the personal computer market has declined with inflation having an impact. Its shares experienced a -9% selloff.”8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Average 3-Month Volume: 32.43 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 196Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a Mountain View, California-based holding company that owns Google, YouTube, and numerous other subsidiaries.Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI assigned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock a target price of $120 along with an Outperform rating, implying a potential upside of over 37% from the closing price as of December 27. The analyst sees Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock as an attractive play for long-term investors. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is said to have paid $2.5 billion to get the rights to the Sunday Ticket subscription service for YouTube. This development is expected to result in an expansion in the paid subscriber base of YouTube TV.Here’s what Mayar Capital said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In early January this year – which admittedly feels like eons ago – US President Joe Biden was pushing Americans to take up the government’s offer of free COVID tests to help tackle the surging omicron variant. How did Biden respond when citizens asked about the availability of these tests?“Google it!”This advice, undoubtedly well-meant, was roundly scoffed at by the press, however. It seemed too obvious to be very helpful.Anyway, the anecdote serves to introduce you to one of our largest holdings, Alphabet; the parent company of Google. Note that first, Alphabet’s original and core product – its search engine – has entered our common vocabulary as a verb. ‘Googling’ something has the same meaning as ‘researching’ or ‘finding an answer to’ something. Second the reason Biden’s advice was met with such opprobrium was because Googling something has become almost second nature to us now.These two observations reveal a lot about Google’s strength in the search engine market, in which it has a share of over 90 percent. Because internet search is almost the prototypical network, Google has benefitted from – and we think is also protected by – the huge competitive advantage its scale brings – both to those asking the questions and those providing the answers. The Google search platform becomes increasingly useful to anyone seeking information as a greater volume of stuff becomes available. This starts a virtuous cycle that results in a colossal market share for Google itself. In the language of business strategists, Google benefits from vast network effects.Because Google’s search results are viewed by billions of eyeballs every day, its search page ‘real estate’ is understandably very valuable to those with goods and services to sell. Advertising revenues from this ‘real estate’ as well as that from its other properties such as Mail, Maps, and so on, totaled almost USD 150b in 2021; amounting to almost 58% of the company’s revenues. Ad sales on YouTube, also owned by Alphabet, brought in another USD 28b. With the secular shift of the advertising spend to digital channels – over which Alphabet has a tight grip – we estimate the company has a share of around 40% of the digital advertising market and is probably the most valuable advertising property in the world…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Average 3-Month Volume: 41.72 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a Charlotte, North Carolina-based provider of asset management, banking, investing, and other diversified financial services.The increase in benchmark interest rates by the Federal Reserve will play out favorably for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as the banking giant would be able to charge a higher markup on its loans. The US Federal Reserve anticipates a soft landing of the economy as it projects a GDP growth of 0.5% in 2023. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve anticipates the interest rate to peak at around 5.1% as opposed to the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%. In case of a recession, experts think the banking system is more prepared to counter the impact as compared to the Financial Crisis of 2008, as the loan-to-deposit rate sits at 70% as opposed to 100% previously.Ariel Investments shared its outlook on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We initiated three new positions in the quarter. We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Average 3-Month Volume: 45.91 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park, California-based diversified technology company with a foothold in the instant messaging (IM) and social media industry.As of December 2022, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has laid off 13,000 employees to streamline its operations. This development is expected to result in an annual saving of around $1.3 billion. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also aggressively rolling out its Reel feature to combat the rise of TikTok. The company claims that 140 billion reels are played on Facebook and Instagram daily, and the development of appropriate tools to monetize this content would help Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) expand its margins. The company is also considering the opportunity to monetize its messaging platform, which is currently contributing $9 billion to the top line annually, equivalent to $5 per user.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We initiated a new position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in the communication services sector, which operates the Facebook and Instagram social media platforms and is a leading digital advertising provider. We have been carefully watching the company over the last few quarters and believe headwinds from lower monetizing in Facebook and Instagram Reels and pressures from consumer privacy measures are poised to lessen. We believe the company has begun to fully acclimate to this new environment, will achieve greater effectiveness in Reels monetization and find ways to adapt to new privacy standards which will rebound advertising efficiency. Combined with a greater focus on cost control, we believe these initiatives will help contribute to further margin expansion and leave the company well-positioned moving forward.”In addition to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Tesla, Inc.

However, one common metric investors love to put focus on is free cash flow.Still, what is free cash flow?Free cash flow is the total cash a company holds onto after paying for operating costs and capital expenditures.It speaks volumes about a company’s financial health, but in what way?A healthy free cash flow provides more growth opportunities, a higher potential for share buybacks, stable dividend payouts, and the ability to wipe out any debt with ease.Three companies – Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and UnitedHealth Group Inc.

UnitedHealth provides a wide range of healthcare products and services, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.UnitedHealth generated a whopping $17.8 billion of free cash flow during its latest quarter, reflecting a steep 150% Y/Y change and an even larger 180% sequential increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike MSFT, UnitedHealth rewards its shareholders; UNH’s annual dividend yield stands at 1.2%, a few ticks below its Zacks Medical sector average of 1.4%. Still, the company’s 17.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack immensely.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Generally, companies that display free cash flow strength are well-established and carry highly-successful business operations, undoubtedly perks that any investor looks for.And all three companies above – Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH – generate rock-solid levels of free cash flow.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

62,a64bb6db-e0fc-47be-8ddc-f1d0739f41a9,MSFT,2022-12-29,11 predictions for 2023—from Yahoo Finance readers,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-predictions-for-2023-from-yahoo-finance-readers-195926540.html,1672257566,STORY,"['META', 'AAPL', '^IXIC', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'RIVN', '^GSPC']","[How good is your intuition?We’ll know in 12 months or so, when we assess the accuracy of predictions that more than 6,000 Yahoo Finance readers made for 2023. We asked for those forecasts in an online survey we ran on Dec. 22 and 23.For now, however, our respondents provided some intriguing ideas about who will make and lose money in 2023, and what might be different by the end of next year. Overall, the Yahoo Finance audience is fairly optimistic. The median forecast for the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) stock index is 4,000 by the end of next year, which would be a 5% gain from current levels (and not another wipeout like 2022 brought). The median forecast for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) index is 11,000, which would be a 6.2% gain. The median outlook for inflation 12 months from now is 4.3%, which would be nearly three points lower than the current level, and welcome news at the Federal Reserve.Nearly 70% of respondents think there will be a recession in 2023, with just 17% saying there won’t be. But in an open-ended question asking about possible surprises in 2023, many poll-takers said they expected a mild and short downturn.We got 3,774 answers to the question about business or economic surprises, which had no prompts and let respondents write whatever they wanted to. So we can’t quantify those responses. But content analysis reveals several recurring themes, and the word cloud below gives some idea of what’s most on investors’ minds as the new year begins. Here are 11 things Yahoo Finance readers predict for 2023:A happy ending. Many investors using Yahoo Finance think that by the second half of 2023, a mild recession will be nearly over, inflation will be under control and the stock market will be rebounding. Sample reader prediction: “Market rebound in the second half of next year and surpassing previous highs.”Related prediction: The unemployment rate rises from 3.7% now to around 5%.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The war in Ukraine ends. The word “war” appeared 256 times amid the 3,774 responses, more than any other significant word. Russia is giving no hints that it plans to give up on its quest to annex parts of its neighbor to the west, but Ukraine clearly has momentum and Russian forces seem exhausted, suggesting a Russian withdrawal might be possible within the next 12 months. Sample prediction: “Russian withdrawal from Ukraine at the end of the year causes the market to surge.”Story continuesRelated: Russia uses a nuclear weapon; NATO and the United States get drawn directly into the war; Russian President Vladimir Putin falls; Russia collapses.Gasoline prices surge again as China reopens. This is very plausible, given that the huge COVID-related slowdown in China this year reduced Chinese demand for energy and helped bring global prices down. China is now lifting strict COVID restrictions and trying to get back to normal. Sample prediction: “Gas prices will move back towards $4 after China fully reopens.”Related: China finds it can’t fully reopen and remains in a kind of economic limbo.Kamala Harris assumes the presidency. Some respondents think President Biden will die in office or suffer a serious illness forcing him to resign. We didn't detect unusual ill will toward Biden in these responses, but they do seem to reflect concerns that the 80-year-old president is too old for one of the world’s most demanding jobs. Sample prediction: “Biden health crisis.”Related: Neither Biden nor Trump mount competitive 2024 presidential campaigns[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or sound off.]Used car prices plunge. This is also plausible, given that the surge in prices in the first half of 2022 could easily reverse in the first half of 2023, especially with rapidly rising rates on auto loans. The Manheim used-car value index is already 14% below its peak from January 2022 and could fall another 20% to get back to normal levels. Sample prediction: “Used-car market collapse.”Related: There’s also a glut of new vehicles by year end.The electric-vehicle revolution stalls. Tesla’s (TSLA) stock price is down 73% from its 2021 peak. EV startups such as Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RIVN) are struggling. Some Yahoo Finance users think these are signs that buyers are starting to think twice about the higher cost, limited range and recharging complexities of EVs. Sample prediction: “Electric cars will not be the future as everyone thinks.”Related: Apple (AAPL) finally introduces the iCar, its first entry into the automotive market.Big Tech makes a comeback. The Nasdaq tech-stock index, down 30%, has fared worse than the broader market in 2022. Some think tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft (MSFT) will no longer be the market’s top dogs. But others think Big Tech will come roaring back once inflation and interest rates stabilize. Sample prediction: “Tech stocks will soar.”Related: Beaten-down Chinese tech stocks will outperform their U.S. rivals.The metaverse finally catches on. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg staked his company’s future on the widespread adoption of the metaverse, where virtual reality somehow enhances the traditional experience of the internet. It didn’t happen in 2022, and Meta’s stock endured a 65% wipeout. But Meta is still standing and maybe Zuck was just a year or two early. Sample prediction: “Collapse of social media and the rise of its replacement, the metaverse.”Related: Resurgence of Meta’s stock price; Zuckerberg steps down as CEOOther big winners: Green energy, 3-D printed houses, shipping. Whether it solves the problem of global warming or not, green energy is likely to generate sizable returns because of the huge federal investments included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The new trend of 3-D printed homes seem like a looming solution to the nation’s housing shortage. Shipping will surge as consumer demand for goods begins to grow again in the second half of 2023. Sample prediction: “Shipping will surprise all forecasters.”Related: Battery metals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel could rise further if EV demand keeps growing.Biden’s student-debt relief plan dies. This actually seems more likely than not, since the Supreme Court will decide if Biden can forgive billions in student debt by executive order sometime during the first half of 2023. Many analysts think the court’s conservative majority has the legal basis and political temerity to nullify Biden’s order, dashing the hopes of some 40 million borrowers. Sample prediction: “Student debt relief will be ruled unconstitutional by Supreme Court, causing an immediate financial crisis. Borrowers will have to borrow more, sell assets, or greatly reduce budget.”Related: A personal-debt crisis if interest rates get too highDonald Trump will form a new political party. He’s losing favor with Republicans, given that many of the candidates he backed in the 2022 midterm elections lost. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seems poised to push Trump aside in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. Sample prediction: “Trump will leave the Republican Party.”Related: Trump will go to jail.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

64,a0642191-3558-33c0-aa8a-d698cc107711,SIG,2022-12-29,Does Signet (SIG) Have the Potential to Rally 26% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-signet-sig-potential-rally-145502815.html,1672239302,STORY,"['TGT', 'SIG']","[Shares of Signet (SIG) have gained 6% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $68.34, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $86 indicates a potential upside of 25.8%.The mean estimate comprises six short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $12.31. While the lowest estimate of $75 indicates a 9.8% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 53.6% to reach $105. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for SIG, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for SIGHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SIG Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 5.3%.Moreover, SIG currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SIG could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

See our latest analysis for Starbucks The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StarbucksThe Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$10.0m worth of shares at a price of US$73.10 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$99.20. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$21m for 274.75k shares. On the other hand they divested 22.32k shares, for US$2.2m. In total, Starbucks insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Starbucks Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Starbucks. In total, insiders sold US$2.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Starbucks insiders own 2.0% of the company, currently worth about US$2.3b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Starbucks Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold Starbucks shares recently, but they didn't buy any. On the other hand, the insider transactions over the last year are encouraging. We are also comforted by the high levels of insider ownership. So we're happy to look past recent trading. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

GO’s flexible sourcing and distribution business model that differentiates it from traditional retailers places it well for sustainable growth.  Its opportunistic purchasing strategy and e-commerce initiatives to deepen customer reach appear encouraging as well. Let’s delve deeper.Strategic DetailsGrocery Outlet continues to navigate through the challenging operating environment. The company is building on the underlying strength of the business across areas such as opportunistic supply, product assortments as well as engagement with customers and independent operators. Additionally, Grocery Outlet has tested a mobile app in Washington State, whereby customers can view trending and top items in stores on a real-time basis and access curated product recommendations based on their preferences.We believe that Grocery Outlet’s compelling value proposition will continue to encourage customers to revisit stores and increase basket sizes. Notably, its expanded product offerings, more “WOW!” Deals and increased customer awareness will help fuel sales. In terms of offerings, the company sources on-trend products based on consumer preferences. Moreover, with consumers now looking for fresh and healthy options, the company has shifted its focus to Natural, Organic, Specialty and Healthy or “NOSH” products.Grocery Outlet provides customers with quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products at exceptional value. We note that a typical “Grocery Outlet basket” is priced roughly 40% below conventional grocers and approximately 20% below leading discounters. Moreover, to drive customers and keep them well informed about price, quality and service, the company has refreshed its brand image by updating its website, modernizing its logo and adopting a new marketing campaign.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesAdditionally, Grocery Outlet is striving to expand stores and undertake prudent marketing initiatives. The company is offering same-day delivery of everyday essentials and staples from all its stores in collaboration with Instacart and DoorDash. It has also teamed up with Uber Technologies to pilot on-demand and scheduled grocery delivery.Management believes that there is room to expand to approximately 1,900 additional locations. In the long term, the company believes that there is potential to establish 4,800 locations nationally. Notably, the company has been undertaking strategic investments to improve its functionality and scalability. These include enhanced point of sale, warehouse management, vendor tracking, store communications, real estate lease management, and financial planning and analysis.What’s More?Impressively, the grocery retailer has managed to stay afloat amid a tough operating landscape. Its shares gained 1.3% in the past year against the industry’s 33.8% plunge. An expected long-term earnings growth rate of 11.9% further speaks volumes for this presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.  Grocery Outlet reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and the bottom lines not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also improved year over year. The company registered a solid comparable store sales performance in the quarter. Stellar results and strong quarter-to-date trends prompted management to lift the net sales and earnings view for 2022.On its last earnings call, management projected 2022 net sales of $3.55 billion compared with $3.08 billion in 2021 and comparable store sales growth of 11% against a 6% decline in 2021. It envisioned adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share for 2022, suggesting an increase from the 90 cents reported in 2021.Analysts look optimistic about Grocery Outlet. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GO’s sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $3.90 billion and $1.11, respectively. These estimates suggest respective growth of 9.8% and 10.6% from the year-ago period’s corresponding figures.On a concluding note, Grocery Outlet will continue performing well on the bourses, buoyed by the aforesaid strengths.3 Better-Ranked Consumer Staples StocksSome better-ranked stocks are Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM, Lamb Weston LW and TreeHouse Foods THS.Archer Daniels, a renowned producer of food and beverage ingredients, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -15% after a very tough-to-compete-with year. However, FY23 estimates of $6.34 per share have climbed from $5.97 a share 90 days ago.ADM's positive bottom-line revisions come on top of an impeccable 2022 performance for the stock. ADM's total 2022 return including dividends is +41% to crush the S&amp;P 500's -20%. Even better, this has topped the Agricultural Operations Market's +23%.It doesn't stop there, ADM's total return over the last decade is +354% to easily beat the benchmark and its Zack Subindustry's +153%.Dividend History:ADM has a 1.71% annual dividend yield at $1.60 a share. Archer Daniels' dividend growth over the last five years is 4.12% with a payout ratio of 22%. The company has raised its dividend for 49 consecutive years.Along with the reliable income, pricing power in the food commodities Archers Daniels produces such as corn and wheat continue to make ADM stock very attractive. The Agriculture Operations Industry is in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks Industries.Story continuesFor Archer Daniels, the growth of its nutrition segment is intriguing with the company's overall product portfolio very strong, making ADM a stolid investment for 2023 and beyond.CaterpillarMost areas of the economy are forecasted to see slower growth next year, making Caterpillar stand out. Caterpillar's Manufacturing-Construction and Mining Industry is in the top 2% of all Zacks industries.Caterpillar stock also sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimates rising over the last 30 days. Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to climb 28% and rise another 7% in FY23 at $14.90 per share.Caterpillar's YTD total return is +18% to impressively beat the S&amp;P 500 and the Machinery Construction/Mining Market's +15%.

Caterpillar's dividend growth over the last five years is 8.94% with a payout ratio of 38%. The company has raised its dividend for 29 consecutive years.Caterpillar's growth continues to be stellar as the company improves on margins from higher demand for their construction and mining equipment.Bottom LineArcher Daniels Midland and Caterpillar stock look poised to be winners again in 2023.

CAH, Insperity Inc. NSP, Deere &amp; Co. DE and H&amp;R Block Inc. HRB.5 Top-Ranked Dividend-Growth Stocks for 2023As volatility and uncertainty triggered by Fed's policy tightening and recessionary fears persist in the stock market ahead of the New Year, dividend investing seems to be a better bet. Though it does not offer dramatic price appreciation, the strategy is a major source of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk.Honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Cardinal Health Inc., Insperity Inc., Deere &amp; Co. and H&amp;R Block Inc. — that could be compelling picks for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Archer-Daniels is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)Southwest Airlines struggled Wednesday to restore operations after a historic meltdown and continued to ground the majority of its flights, leaving thousands of frustrated fliers stranded at airports around the country and drawing federal scrutiny into the “system failure.""Southwest canceled 2,508 flights Wednesday, according to the flight tracker Flight Aware, with an additional 2,348 already canceled for Thursday. That follows nearly a week of turmoil that began with a severe winter storm that pounded the nation and challenged air carriers over the holidays.But as other airlines recovered, Southwest struggled to keep its operation running. The airline has canceled almost 13,000 flights — well over 50% of its services — since Dec. 22, according to FlightAware.Airline industry experts say the storm exposed the company’s vulnerable operations and outdated technology that stymied the carrier's ability to bounce back from disruptions. Southwest officials say the problems are expected to linger for at least “several days.”Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan apologized to customers in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday evening and said the carrier was ""focused on safely getting all of the pieces back into position to end this rolling struggle.""But those pieces — including aircraft and flight crews — were unaccounted for in dozens of locations, Jordan said, and despite the airline’s best efforts, the company needs to “significantly reduce our flying” to one-third of its schedule over the next couple of days to recoup.“The tools we use to recover from disruption serve us well 99% of the time, but clearly, we need to double down on our already existing plans to upgrade systems for these extreme circumstances so that we never again face what’s happening right now,” he said, adding that he remained optimistic that the airline will be back on track before next week.Beyond the logistics of getting planes back in the air and luggage back to travelers, Southwest’s customer service reputation is on the line.Story continuesFrustrated fliers shared experiences across social media about waiting in long queues or on hold for hours with customer service agents, often getting disconnected before receiving any help, as they attempted to rebook or receive a refund for their travels. Many are hopeful they will be compensated for additional expenses they were forced to make amid the chaos such as renting a car or booking with another airline.Although some have reported getting refunds for their canceled flights, many are still struggling to get a response.In an email, a Southwest spokesperson said that the company launched a new online portal for customers to rebook their flights or request a refund.“Many of the refunds will be handled on a case-by-case basis and teams are already engaged in those efforts,” said Dan Landson, Southwest’s public relations advisor.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stepped up pressure on the company this week and told ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday that the massive cancellations ""indicates a system failure"" and the agency will be “watching closely” to ensure Southwest meets its customer service commitments. Southwest’s compensation for passengers should cover flights along with meals, lodging and ground transportation because “this is the airline’s responsibility,” he said.“This is going to take an extraordinary level of effort by Southwest, and we will mount an extraordinary effort to ensure that they are meeting their obligations” to their customers, Buttigieg said.According to the Transportation Department, passengers are entitled to a refund if their flight is canceled and they choose not to travel, and if there was a “significant” change or delay to the flight — though the agency does not specifically define what is considered ""significant.""Airline agents have the discretion to offer extra compensation for hotel expenses or a seat on a different airline.Southwest’s passenger rights policy states that “if circumstances within the airline's control cause a customer to miss the last possible flight or connection of the day to his or her destination, Southwest’s customer-service agents have the authority to arrange for overnight lodging for that customer and will find the customer a hotel or motel as near to the airport as possible, at no additional cost. Customer service may also arrange for ground transportation to the overnight facility.” But this requires a phone call or conversation with a Southwest agent, which has become a challenge in itself during the recent meltdown.Southwest officials did not respond to questions about how many refunds have been issued in recent days.The carrier's meltdown has hit many of its would-be passengers in the pocketbook.Southwest passenger Neavaly Touray estimated she’s built up a $3,000 tab after her connecting flight from Nashville to L.A., which originated in Washington, D.C., was canceled Monday. That includes the rental car and gas for the 35-hour drive to L.A., food and clothes for her family — three kids and two adults — and two nights at the Huntington Beach hotel she’d already paid for.“That was our money for our vacation,” Touray, 62, said. She said she heard — both in the news and at her gate — that Southwest is encouraging travelers to buy what they needed and submit receipts through an online system.The airline said ""they would be true to honoring [their customers], and they would be giving us refunds to the things we encounter,” Touray said, adding she can’t be sure it’s guaranteed. “I am just hoping.”After Kate Schelter’s Oakland-to-Los Angeles flight was canceled, a gate agent at the Oakland airport gave her travel vouchers, though she was told she was getting refunded, she said.Like Touray, Schelter decided to drive with her kids, ages 9 and 12, and picked up additional expenses along the way, including a hotel room and toiletries. She said she wasn’t aware that she could get reimbursed for any of the costs and isn’t sure whether she kept the receipts. When she arrived in L.A., Schelter spent two hours in a queue at the airport to ask Southwest representatives if she could transfer her flight vouchers into a refund only to be told she needed to call customer service.She’s also out the $120 she paid for an early-bird check-in for herself and her children, she said.Schelter hasn’t yet tried calling Southwest, in part because she doesn’t want to spend hours on the phone only to get “potentially more bad information,” and will try to resolve the issue when she’s home from vacation, she said.“I am sure they are so tied up right now,” she said.Times staff photographer Irfan Khan contributed to this report.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Suffice to say that Wednesday, as I write, its 2,508 flight cancellations account for 90% of all domestic flight cancellations in the U.S. (The statistics are from FlightAware.)We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.Southwest CEO Bob JordanOn Tuesday, Southwest accounted for about 84% of the more than 3,200 domestic flight cancellations.That trend implies that as the country's other air carriers have begun to work out their own traffic snarls resulting from the massive ""bomb cyclone"" that struck the U.S. starting on the day before Christmas, Southwest remains mired in disaster. The airline says it will take days to work its way out.One can't blame Southwest for the magnitude of the storm, obviously.One can, however, examine why the airline has done so much worse than its rivals, why the other carriers didn't do so well either, and why American companies generally get caught so often with their pants down when operating conditions materialize on the edge of — or outside — normal expectations.The short answer is their underinvestment in preparation and planning. For decades, Big Business has been squandering its resources on handouts to shareholders instead of spending on workers and infrastructure. There's not enough give in the system, so when crisis comes, it doesn't bend, but breaks.What drives this tendency is economics. Business managements have become hostages to cost-cutting, squeezing expenses out of their systems in every way possible, trusting to luck that what works under normal conditions will continue to work when the outside world goes haywire. They're betting their companies on a bad strategy.Story continuesThere are numerous manifestations of this cheeseparing habit. One is just-in-time production, which spread like wildfire from Toyota, where it originated in the 1980s, to the rest of the automobile industry and eventually to the manufacturing sector generally.The idea was to slash waste by coordinating inventories of parts, the supply of workers and the time for production so that everything was in place when needed and not a minute before or after.The pace of work sped up, workers were squeezed on wages and hours, parts suppliers operated on ever-narrower margins. It all worked fine, until it didn't.The dream of a production line ""inherently flexible, inventoryless, even computerless, replenished by infinitely responsive suppliers"" was too simple, Uday Karmarkar, an expert in manufacturing strategy and technology at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, observed as long ago as 1989. ""Just-in-time manufacturing is producing revolutionaries who don’t know when to stop.""Beginning in the summer of 2021, logjams in the global supply chain, compounded by a surge in post-pandemic goods orders from consumers returning to shops, left manufacturers without needed parts and retailers without merchandise.Only since that crisis erupted have manufacturers recognized that they need to move away from just-in-time to just-in-case — that is, keeping more parts inventory on-site and more workers, with better training, on call.Another manifestation is outsourcing. Boeing could have learned the lesson that outsourcing can increase costs and place a heavy burden on management from its experience with its 787 Dreamliner.The next-generation aircraft came in billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule when it finally began to fly commercially in 2011, in part because Boeing farmed out more of the work to foreign contractors.Some of the pieces manufactured by far-flung suppliers didn’t fit together. Some subcontractors couldn’t meet their output quotas, creating huge production logjams when crucial parts weren’t available in the necessary sequence.“We gave work to people that had never really done this kind of technology before, and then we didn’t provide the oversight that was necessary,” Jim Albaugh, then the company’s commercial aviation chief, acknowledged. “The pendulum swung too far.”Yet Boeing pursued an outsourcing strategy for crucial systems in its 737 Max. After the plane suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 because of malfunctioning software, leading to a years-long grounding by aeronautics regulators around the world, Bloomberg reported that Boeing had outsourced its software development to overseas firms employing engineers for as little as $9 an hour.The company maintained that it was fully capable of supervising the foreign software engineers' work. The Max is back in the air now and rolling out to customers, the largest of which is Southwest Airlines.That brings us back to the Southwest meltdown. A full explanation may not emerge for some time, but it's possible to identify some contributing factors.One is the airline's practice of operating with the tightest of operational constraints. Southwest has long prided itself on its short turnaround times between landings and takeoffs, aimed at maximizing the efficiency of its fleet and sometimes mandating turns as brief as 35 minutes.Yet this is not the first time that the practice produced disaster. That would be 2014, when the carrier's on-time performance suddenly cratered. The problem was that Southwest decided to cram many more flights into its schedule without expanding its aircraft fleet.Its confidence stemmed from a relatively trouble-free performance during 2012, which was a mild weather year. But it soon became clear that the schedule’s demanding tolerances could be met only on days with near-perfect weather and no mechanical mishaps.The airline built more flexibility into its schedule after that, but other factors came into play during the last week. They include Southwest's point-to-point flight map, which differs from the hub-and-spoke configuration of other major carriers such as United and Delta, which concentrate operations at large regional airports such as Chicago and Atlanta.That simplifies the challenge of coordinating aircraft and crews so they're in place together, limiting (if not eliminating) the chance that local or regional weather crises will affect flights nationwide.Southwest doesn't have the same coordination capacity — and according to employees, its complex point-to-point system requires more robust scheduling technology than it has implemented.""Our internal scheduling software can’t handle massive cancellations,"" Michael Santoro, vice president of the Southwest pilots union, told my colleague Margot Roosevelt in an interview. ""The company hasn’t invested the money into scheduling infrastructure to support the network they have developed.”The outdated system is unequipped to handle rerouting involved in hundreds of cancellations, Santoro said. “So pilots are calling in asking, 'I’m done with this flight — where do I go next? Am I running another plane? Do I spend the night here?' And pilots are on hold for hours trying to figure out what to do next.”When the weather is perfect, the software matches crews to planes. “But when there’s a disruption like this storm, our system can’t handle it,"" Michael Massoni, first vice president of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, told Roosevelt.""Southwest loses control because we don’t have 21st century technology. So what happens is chaos. Southwest starts to deal with the problem manually, which is incredibly tedious.”Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan acknowledged the software scheduling problem in a message to Southwest employees obtained by CNN.“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan said. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”What has the airline been spending money on, if not mission-critical corporate infrastructure? On dividends and stock buybacks, which flow directly to shareholders.Early in December, the airline announced that it would reinstate its dividend — suspended during the pandemic — by paying 18 cents a share to investors in early January. The payout will cost nearly $107 million. Since 2015, the company has paid out about $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased more than $8 billion in shares — that is, handouts to shareholders.The dividend resumption may be cold comfort to Southwest stockholders, who have seen their shares sink in value by about 28% this year and by more than 18% just since Thanksgiving.But it will send a chillier wind at its passengers, thousands of whom have been stranded at airports with no guarantee that they will be granted a seat on a Southwest flight for days to come and who may wish that Jordan stopped talking about modernizing the airline, and started acting.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

That's according to FlightAware. We want to bring in Scott Forbes, Jefferies Airlines Equity Research. Scott, it's great to see you.So I think the big question here for investors at least is how big of a hit this is going to be to Southwest's revenue and to its profit in the fourth quarter. What are your expectations?SCOTT FORBES: Yeah, so our assumptions right now are that these cancellations are expected to span around 60% of flights between December 22 and December 31. In aggregate, that's around a 6% capacity hit. And when you actually bring that over to the revenue side, it's going to be around 9% of their Q4 revenue as a full impact.And then on the cost side, just from the inefficiencies surrounding all of these flight cancellations, the lower capacity in all of those items, you're going to look at a 10-point unit cost hit. And in aggregate, we expect there to be a $700 million EBITDA hit to the bottom line, which is almost 60% of our Q4 expectations of $1.1 billion of profits. So it's almost a 60% hit on their Q4 profits of what really is just one of the worst weeks that we've seen in 20 years for an airline.JARED BLIKRE: And Scott, how much of this hit that Southwest stock is expected to take-- or at least their financial statement is expected to take-- coming from the need to modernize their operations and the need to upgrade their technology. It seems maybe simple bug fixes are out of the question. Or maybe not out of the question here, but it seems there are some antiquated systems that need to be brought up to snuff.So just wondering if that's part of your analysis here?Story continuesSCOTT FORBES: Yeah, it's not necessarily in this quarter. But I think as we look out over a three year period, I mean, that's definitely something that has to be kind of taken into account. Southwest has sort of faced a headwind over the last few years where they haven't necessarily invested into their systems, they haven't necessarily invested into their product, and those decade or so of underinvestment is going to hit them over the next three to five years.So whether that be $2 billion of investments into the product, in the actual plane, and bringing USB-C ports onto the plane, upgrading the WiFi, adding larger overhead bins, like all of that just adds to this incremental investment that they're going to have to make into these systems that are clearly very problematic for the airline and will be very expensive to fix both in this quarter, but also over the next few years kind of investing in these systems and getting their operations up to what's expected for the industry.- And Scott, we heard that from Southwest CEO Bob Jordan. He was responding to some of the backlash to these cancellations. I want to play a quick sound bite for what he had to say.- The tools we use to recover from disruption service well 99% of the time. But clearly, we need to double-down on our already existing plans to upgrade systems for these extreme circumstances so that we never again face what's happening right now.- So Scott, Southwest CEO clearly seeing the need for investment. But my question to you is just the reputational damage from this in terms of future demand, what that potentially looks like for Southwest? I guess, how long do you see this backlash really affecting the airline?SCOTT FORBES: I mean, that's substantial and it's something that could really affect customer demand for the next year. I mean, Southwest was out over the past year talking about extending flight credits and how much goodwill that was really giving to them across the airline. Instead, now you're facing a reputational damage that's coming from one of the worst airline incidents over the last 20 years.So it's substantial and it's something that will likely affect profitability and demand over the next one to two years, if that.JARED BLIKRE: And Scott, Southwest is known for the its fleet of 737s. And according to your notes, they're going to take delivery of 312 aircraft between 2023 and 2025. How does this affect their operations?SCOTT FORBES: Yeah, so that'll actually be fairly positive for the operations. It'll allow them to move to the max, which is 20% more fuel efficient per seat, offers more seats per plane. So there's substantial benefit coming from that and the cost benefits that come with that as well.The issue is that those 312 aircrafts, you're going to spend incremental CapEx on them throughout the next three years. So those 312 aircrafts, you're looking at $14 billion of CapEx. The airline's going to be a cash user over the next three years of roughly $600 million to billion, in that range. So that's something that's going to affect their balance sheet going forward.And I mean, compared to the rest of the industry, it's fairly modest. But I think that's something where you're financing all of these planes with higher interest rates and it's something that should be a headwind for the industry as a whole going forward.- And Scott, as we wrap this up here, just the meltdown that this has caused. Obviously, it has triggered some questions, a lot of, I guess-- questions is the best way to put it from policymakers, Biden administration criticizing what Southwest has done over the last several days. When you take a look at the regulatory risk or maybe government involvement down the road, how does that look-- how are you looking at that just from an analyst perspective and what that overhang could mean not only for Southwest, but the entire industry?SCOTT FORBES: I think when any specific airline gets the eye of the regulators, it's never necessarily a good thing and it's normally for the wrong reasons. I mean, it's not something that we necessarily bake into our forecasts. But it's something that will likely accelerate a lot of these investments that are being made in these three year cycles of investing in crew scheduling, investing in operational integrity, investing in labor, investing in all of these items that make the operation get to where they want it to be. So that's the major item. And that'll be a headwind to profitability over the next three years.- Scott Forbes, great to have you. Thanks so much for breaking down the risk here for Southwest going forward.]"

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Western Union’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Western Union What's The Opportunity In Western Union?Good news, investors! Western Union is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Western Union’s ratio of 6.44x is below its peer average of 28.24x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the IT industry. What’s more interesting is that, Western Union’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move closer to its industry peers, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What does the future of Western Union look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Western Union, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although WU is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to WU, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WU for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Western Union at this point in time.

86,d4407c8d-4d81-3a74-a11b-4334fcb0e798,SPG,2022-12-29,Simon Property (SPG) Shares Rally 31.6% QTD: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/simon-property-spg-shares-rally-135601438.html,1672235761,STORY,['SPG'],"[Shares of Simon Property Group SPG have rallied 31.6% so far in the quarter, ahead of the industry’s increase of 16.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook as it has increased marginally upward over the past month to $11.68. Also, the FFO per share estimate for 2023 has moved up slightly to $12.11.Let us now decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price and upward estimate revisions for the FFO per share.Recently, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) completed its earlier announced strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. In October 2022, Simon Property announced that it would acquire a 50% interest in Jamestown from the latter’s founding partners.The partnership seems a strategic fit for SPG as it anticipates its stake in Jamestown to be accretive to earnings. With an experienced fund manager and a mixed-use operator and developer, Simon Property will have the scope to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses.Moreover, in November, SPG announced that Leap, the retail platform for modern brands, would open numerous stores at its properties. The move will help many digitally native brands to strategically expand as omnichannel retailers.To begin with, Simon Property and Leap intend to open four stores between California and Florida. These are True Classic Tees in Los Angeles' Del Amo Fashion Center and ThirdLove, Sugarfina and Goodlife in Florida's Town Center at Boca Raton.Also, in November, Nobu Hospitality and Simon Property celebrated the opening of Nobu Hotel &amp; Restaurant Atlanta at the mixed-use development — Phipps Plaza — in Buckhead.The increase in consumers’ preference for an in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand. As a result, SPG’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad has been experiencing solid leasing activity.During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, the company signed 983 new leases and 1,116 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.The occupancy for Simon Property’s U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio improved 170 basis points year over year to 94.5% as of Sep 30, 2022. Also, the base-minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $54.80 as of Sep 30, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Sep 30, 2021.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, SPG’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for Simon Property.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited the third quarter of 2022 with $8.6 billion in liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 5.0, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.SPG’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 54.59% compared with the industry’s average of 6.27%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.In addition, Simon Property’s current cash flow growth is projected at 44.90% compared with the 26.69% growth estimated for the industry. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and SPG has consistently raised its dividend rates. Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings release on Nov 1, 2022, SPG announced a 2.9% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.80 per share. Before this, the company increased its third-quarter 2022 dividend to $1.75 per share from $1.70 paid earlier. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, given the convenience of online shopping, it is likely to remain a popular choice among consumers, affecting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores. Also, interest rate hikes add to Simon Property’s concerns.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are American Assets Trust AAT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Assets Trust’s 2022 FFO per share has moved 2.2% north to $2.34 over the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tanger Factory Outlet Centers’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past month to $1.81.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Schlumberger certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Schlumberger.How Is Schlumberger's Growth Trending?Schlumberger's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 78% last year. However, the latest three year period hasn't been as great in aggregate as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 21% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.1% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Schlumberger's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that Schlumberger maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Schlumberger that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Schlumberger.

That came out on the streaming service over the holiday weekend. If you've seen the movie, then you're going to be excited about this. Now this home listed for $450 million. It's 29,000 square feet, 17 bedrooms, 22 bathrooms.Features include an ocean view, private beach, six pools, priceless works of art, green energy power, museum grade security. Certainly a smart promotional move here, marketing move, from not only Zillow, but also clearly Netflix here, drumming up some excitement around this movie, Jared. I haven't seen it yet. Have you?JARED BLIKRE: I have. I saw it. I watched it over the weekend. I did not see the first one. And I was a little bit disappointed. I didn't see what it was all about. I did like the house. I wouldn't mind living there. And especially if it contains priceless works of art because if you can't put a price on it, that tells me it's worth more than $450 million. I don't know. That's my take.SEANA SMITH: It certainly has been a hit. What, 82 million viewing hours have happened so far. 35 million households have watched the movie. This is according to Netflix. Even with those impressive numbers, though, it only puts it at number six in terms of the biggest debuts for Netflix. So we'll see. I have to see it. I don't know. I've heard good things, though.

The company quickly rolled out an ad-supported tier, in a reversal of its years-long resistance to the idea, and is aiming to try to monetize rampant password-sharing in 2023. Media conglomerates Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery have been forced to rationalize streaming investments, as Wall Street has refocused on bottom-line results rather than subscriber numbers.In 2023, for major streaming services, “there’s an intensifying focus on profitability and free cash flow generation,” amid uncertainty about which way the economic winds will blow, notes John Harrison, Americas media and entertainment leader at EY. He adds, “We’re moving to this really large decision point for media companies where they need to reconfirm their commitment to direct-to-consumer [streaming] — to make it as robust and attractive as possible — or they need to say, ‘Long term, this won’t be as big as we expected.'”Here are five key questions heading into the new year for the sector.How Will Bob Iger Recalibrate Disney’s Streaming Strategy?Iger is back as Disney’s CEO, taking over for the ousted Bob Chapek. Iger has already signaled that he intends to pull back on “aggressive marketing and aggressive spend on content” for Disney+ in favor of profitability. How that exactly will play out in 2023 is an open question. MoffettNathanson principal analyst Michael Nathanson, in a research note this month, opined that Disney+ would be better served by focusing on “premium branded IP” rather than general entertainment or sports. “We think new CEO Bob Iger should address the long-term viability” of Disney+’s previous growth targets “and reduce investment in general entertainment content,” Nathanson wrote. On a similar front, there’s the question of Hulu’s future ownership (Comcast has the right to sell its 33% Hulu ownership stake to Disney as early as January 2024, and conversely Disney can require Comcast to sell it at that point). Chapek had expressed an interest in doing a deal with Comcast to bring Hulu fully into the Mouse House fold sooner rather than later. Iger may have different thoughts on Hulu’s strategic value to Disney going forward.Story continuesWill Netflix’s Ad Tier and Password-Sharing Monetization Move the Needle?Netflix sees an opportunity to generate millions in new revenue through its ad-supported streaming play, while it’s also going to start nagging password-sharing violators to pay up for illicit account piggybackers in early 2023. How well the company can execute on these plans remains to be seen. Third-party data indicates the ad tier is off to a relatively slow start. The revenue Netflix can realize from account-sharing customers will be gated by how aggressively the company intends to push — and signs point to a gentler honor-system approach, at least at first.What Will the Combined HBO Max-Discovery+ Platform Look Like?Warner Bros. Discovery is hoping a merged HBO Max-Discovery+ platform, set to debut in the U.S. next spring, will prove that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts — and help justify Discovery’s gargantuan acquisition of WarnerMedia. But it’s still unclear how WBD will manage the transition: The company has not announced pricing or packaging details, much less a name for the combo (“Max” is among the contenders). At a high level, EY’s Harrison says, it makes sense for streaming providers to move toward consolidation and bundling. “For all the companies with multiple streaming apps… there has to be a decision about whether the most compelling offering is pushing everything into a single app and reducing as much friction as possible,” he says.How Much FAST-er Will FAST Get?In 2022, free, ad-supported television streaming (FAST) continued to accelerate. Paramount’s Pluto TV, Fox’s Tubi, Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel saw gains that in some cases outpaced the growth of subscription-based services. Now others are looking to jump into the FAST lane, including Warner Bros. Discovery: WBD announced plans to license certain content that has been on HBO Max — including “Westworld,” “The Nevers,” “Raised by Wolves” and “FBoy Island” — to third-party FAST partners. And Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav has said the media company will be “aggressively attacking” the low end of the streaming market with its own FAST offering to launch sometime in 2023.How Will YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket Deal Change the Game?Google is betting football fans will flock to NFL’s Sunday Ticket on YouTube — which, for the first time starting with the 2023 season, will be available to anyone in the U.S. without the purchase of a pay-TV package (as has been the case with long-time distributor DirecTV). Google will need to sign up at least 2.25 million Sunday Ticket subs to break even on the deal, according to an estimate by Baird senior research analyst Colin Sebastian. But it could turn out to be a loss-leader for YouTube as the video giant looks to siphon away more TV ad dollars and pack on more YouTube TV customers. Under the seven-year pact, Google will reportedly pay the NFL at least $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket.RSVP todayBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

Is a recovery to pre-pandemic levels next?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/box-office-receipts-rose-70-in-2022-is-a-recovery-to-pre-pandemic-levels-next-193934894.html,1672256374,STORY,['NFLX'],"[The box office climbed back from steep pandemic losses in 2022, but recovering to 2019 levels is the industry's next challenge to clear in the new year.According to data from Comscore, the domestic box office brought in an estimated $7.33 billion through December 27, representing a roughly 70% year-over-year increase but still 30% below pre-pandemic levels when total North American ticket sales hit $11 billion.Shares of AMC (AMC), IMAX (IMAX), and Cinemark (CNK) have fallen roughly 85%, 25%, and 50%, respectively, this year as media stocks shed a whopping $500 billion-plus in value over the past year. (AMC, of course, is in a slightly different bucket due to its prominent role in the meme stock collapse.)Still, there is hope among analysts that next year's more beefed-up release schedule will help close the gap after COVID-induced production delays pushed a significant number of titles into the new year.""The lesson learned is if you build it, they will come,"" Comscore senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Yahoo Finance Live, noting there were around 40 fewer wide releases in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic times. ""When the movies were out there in the summer, we saw the box office explode. But there weren't as many films in the post-summer period.""Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, added: ""Theaters need more films. That's really the bottom line...I look at 2023 on the whole as an improvement over 2022.""Robbins said more mid-range films, or movies that perform in the $50 million to $175 million range, coupled with more family-friendly content, will help buoy ticket sales with more than 100 wide-release films set for next year.He said sequels like ""Fast X,"" ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods,"" ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,"" ""Dune: Part Two"" ""Creed III,"" ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" and the ""Hunger Games"" prequel will all likely land in the upper end of those ranges, possibly higher.Story continuesFamily titles he's watching include ""Trolls 3,"" ""Wanka,"" ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" ""Elemental,"" and Disney's live-action ""Little Mermaid.""""It's hard to say that we'll have another movie as big as 'Top Gun Maverick,' but the flip side of that coin is I think we'll have more films that perform in that $200 million to $400 million range,"" he said.Top Gun takes top billing""Top Gun: Maverick"" shattered a 15-year record after it debuted to much fanfare over the Memorial Day Weekend holiday. The Tom Cruise-led sequel was highest grossing film of the year, securing $1.5 billion globally.The film went on to become the number one digital release of all time on OTT streaming platforms before officially debuting on Paramount+ on December 22.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.But not every film released in 2022 has been an immediate box office success story.Disney's (DIS) ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" secured just $134 million in domestic markets over its three-day opening weekend, missing expectations and sending Disney shares to their lowest level since March 2020.Despite the miss, the film recovered nicely in its second weekend over the long Christmas holiday before it officially crossed $1 billion in global tickets 12 days after its debut — the fastest movie of the year to soar past the highly-regarded industry benchmark. ""Top Gun Maverick"" and ""Jurassic World: Dominon"" were the only other films to cross that $1 billion milestone this year.""My biggest cautionary tale with this movie has been to play the long game,"" Robbins said. ""There's always an immediate urge to qualify a movie's opening weekend. In a lot of cases, that's possible, especially with front-loaded franchises like Marvel or Star Wars. James Cameron's films have never been that way.""""Avatar: The Way of Water"" secures $1 billion in global box office ticket sales (Courtesy: Disney)The analyst noted the film has faced added complexities due to the strong preference to see it in premium formats, like IMAX, which have a limited theatrical supply compared to the overwhelming demand.IMAX announced on Tuesday the sequel had earned $105.5 million in IMAX global box office in less than two weeks — the fastest film to hit the $100 million mark in IMAX since April 2019 (and only the ninth film to reach that milestone in its history).""'Avatar: The Way of Water' is showing the strong endurance at the global box office we expected, particularly with its phenomenal performance internationally where several key markets grew their grosses over opening weekend,"" IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond said in a press release.The film, largely expected to benefit from a rare China release, has faced recent challenges as China's box office slows amid a severe spike in COVID-19 cases. Still, according to IMAX, the company pulled in $26.5 million in China box office receipts, representing about 25.5% of total grosses in the country on 1% of screens.Will more streamers embrace theatrical? Streaming companies have slowly begun to embrace the theatrical window, with high-powered Hollywood executives arguing that the box office has become an essential stop for films looking to turn a profit.""The debate is over,"" IMAX's Gelfond previously told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The argument that you can skip a theatrical window and make up for it on streaming just isn't true. The theatrical window is more essential than ever to get the streaming revenue.""Gelfond referenced deep streaming losses from the likes of Disney, which saw its direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1, while other media giants like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global (PARA) have also struggled with profitability.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Netflix (NFLX), which has been largely resistant to a box office partnership, released ""Knives Out: Glass Onion"" in select theaters over Thanksgiving week as co-CEO Reed Hastings admitted the streaming giant left ""lots"" of money on the table after it refused to commit to a wider release.""It’s a promotional tactic like film festivals, and if it works well we will do more of it,"" Hastings said at the New York Times Dealbook Summit last month. ""We are not trying to build a theatrical business, we are trying to break through the noise.""According to industry estimates, the film secured about $13 million in domestic markets — despite only playing for one week in some 600 theaters. To compare, a typical blockbuster plays in roughly 3,500 theaters for at least 45 days.Box Office Pro's Robbins suggested the theatrical success of ""Glass Onion"" points to a ""watershed moment for the relationship between Netflix and all streamers and exhibitors.""""If anything is going to move the needle, it's going to start here with this movie,"" he added.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, however, downplayed the decision, telling investors on the company's third quarter earnings call: ""We are in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix, so that’s where we focus all our energy and most of our spend.""The streaming giant revealed the sequel was streamed 82.1 million hours in the first three days since its December 23 release. That doesn't even crack Netflix's top five film debuts — falling behind titles like ""The Unforgivable"" (85.86 million hours), ""The Gray Man"" (88.55 million hours), ""The Adam Project"" (92.43 million hours), ""Don’t Look Up"" (111.03 million hours), and ""Red Notice"" (148.72 million hours)Netflix released 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery' in select theaters for one week over Thanksgiving (Courtesy: Netflix)Tech behemoth Amazon (AMZN), which closed its $8.5 billion deal to acquire MGM earlier this year, will also sharpen its focus on theatrical releases, reportedly investing $1 billion to produce 12 to 15 movies a year exclusively for theaters.""Much will come down to what kind of content Amazon produces, how long their windows will be, and how heavily it may lean on IP versus original material, but this is still resoundingly good news for theater owners and Hollywood,"" Robbins said at the time of the announcement.""Now that streaming has begun to mature, the pendulum is certainly swinging back toward a balance as these distributors see the kind of success they've been leaving on the table with an all-in approach to streaming,"" Robbins said. ""Theatrical remains a very lucrative business model, and [Amazon's] news underscores that yet again.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

So far this year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 48.8% compared with the industry’s 34.3% growth.What’s Favoring the Stock?The pricing scenario of natural gas is significantly healthier this year than last year. In its short-term energy outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) revealed its forecast of the Henry Hub spot average price in the first quarter of 2023 to be more than $6.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), higher than the commodity’s average price of $5.50/MMBtu for November. EIA stated that the healthier price is backed by increasing LNG export and improved demand for natural gas in winter. Being a leading producer of natural gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) in the United States, the massive improvement in the commodity price is a boon for Range Resources’ upstream operations.In Appalachia, RRC has decades of low-risk drilling inventory, brightening its production outlook. The company has lower well costs per lateral foot than many other upstream players.Range Resources has a strong focus on strengthening its balance sheet. Range Resources expects 2022 to be the fifth straight year of absolute debt reduction. On a positive note, the company has the lowest emission intensity among the upstream companies in the United States.RisksIn spite of the positive factors, RRC’s overall operations are significantly exposed to extreme oil and natural gas price volatility.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are Phillips 66 PSX, BP plc BP and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. NEX. While Phillips 66 and BP carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), NexTier Oilfield sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.To make its operations more stable, Phillips 66 is giving more attention to midstream (pipelines), renewables and chemicals businesses. It also has strong refining operations.Story continuesThe positive oil price trajectory is a boon for BP’s upstream operations. The favorable oil price scenario and increasing daily oil equivalent production volumes are aiding the energy giant’s bottom line. BP stated that the target of adding a net production of 900 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 from key new projects had been delivered.NexTier Oilfield Solutionsis also a well-known U.S. land oilfield service player. With higher exploration and production by upstream companies, demand for NexTier Oilfield’s diverse set of well completion and production services is handsome.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Phillips 66 (PSX) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.48 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 27, 2023.Phillips 66's Earnings ESP sits at 0.58%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.48 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.45.PSX is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure. Williams Companies, Inc. The (WMB) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Williams Companies, Inc. The, which is readying to report earnings on February 20, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.47 a share, and WMB is 54 days out from its next earnings report.Williams Companies, Inc. The's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.43% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47.Story continuesPSX and WMB's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Murphy USA MUSA, NexTier Oilfield Solutions NEX, Phillips 66 PSX, ProPetro Holding PUMP and Liberty Energy LBRT.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Oil &amp; Gas Stocks Still on Sale Despite Sector BoomDespite concerns surrounding high inflation and slowing growth, this year has been a stellar one for Oil/Energy bulls. The space has easily emerged as the best performing of all 11 U.S. market sectors, gaining nearly 57% so far in 2022. In contrast, the other 10 indexes have all suffered losses year to date. Meanwhile, the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark is down more than 19% during this period.While Wall Street continues to be largely bullish on energy, the sector is notoriously volatile, with sudden positive surprises and crashes. Against this backdrop, it will be fruitful to invest in top-ranked companies that are trading below their true value before the broader market catches on.Taking this into account, Murphy USA, NexTier Oilfield Solutions, Phillips 66, ProPetro Holding and Liberty Energy make the cut.Energy Defies Broader Market SelloffApart from a positive fundamental picture, the catalyst behind the energy markets' strength could be attributed to geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia's military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels. However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters' group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Story continuesMeanwhile, natural gas hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 earlier this year and is still trading some 75% higher year to date on the back of favorable weather and strong LNG shipments.Focus on Value StocksWhile the Energy sector can generate great returns when commodity prices go up and profits skyrocket, it is also exposed to heavy selling pressure when realizations crater. In other words, the oil and gas business is inherently cyclical, with delicate supply/demand balances, among others, determining their fortunes.Given this uncertainty, it will be wise for investors to apportion their funds in value stocks. Value investing has always been a popular strategy, and with a good reason too. Historical data suggests that value stocks not only tend to outperform growth stocks but are relatively less volatile. Specifically, for investors who are risk-averse, value investing offers an opportunity to enter the market and grab stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by most, and are thus trading at cheap multiples.Our ChoicesTo go with a Value Score of A, we have shortlisted companies with strong fundamentals. This is where the Zacks Rank can come in really handy.We have picked five energy stocks with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) as our research shows such stocks offer good investment opportunities. The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance.

The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract.

The copper-rich country's currency jumped as much as 2.6% at 844.9 per dollar, last up 0.6% in afternoon trading. It touched its strongest level since Sept. 5. News that Chile's central bank would extend its forward dollar sales operations program to June from a previously announced end date of January boosted the currency in the previous session. Brightening the mood further on Wednesday, copper prices hit two-week peaks as top consumer China's easing of COVID restrictions spurred buying of the metal despite a rise in infection there. The Brazilian real gained 0.6% and the Mexican peso held ground against the dollar even as data showed Brazil created fewer formal jobs than expected in November, while another set showed Mexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate eased to 3% in November from 3.2% in the previous month. Most stock markets in the region also rose, with Brazil's Bovespa touching a three-week high with miner Vale and banks among the top performers. The MSCI's index for Latin American stocks is up 1.4% in 2022. In contrast, the MSCI'S broader gauge for emerging market stocks has fallen more than 22% for the year, heading for its worst performance since 2008. ""Persistent above-trend inflation has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy leading to a bear market (falls of greater than 20%),"" said Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo, also pointing to weakness in China. On the day, Brazil's Petroreconcavo SA climbed 5.7% after the oil company agreed to buy Maha Energy's local subsidiary, in another step in its ongoing expansion. Brazilian President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva invited centrist Senator Simone Tebet to be his planning minister, a close Lula aide said on Tuesday. Investors had expected a market friendly person to get the position, but markets will welcome Tebet, said analyst Lucas de Aragao of Arko Advice consultancy in Brasilia while calling her ""very moderate."" Meanwhile, Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose term ends in September 2024, said the country will cut the cost of servicing external debt by half for the start of the next administration. The Argentine peso fell 0.8% to a record low of 359 per dollar in the parallel black market, according to traders.

Workers demanded better safety conditions, higher wages, and more environmental regulation.A month-long state of emergency has been declared in Peru after supporters of Pedro Castillo—the imprisoned former president—blocked roads, closed airports, and ratcheted up pressure on the country’s new government. The extraordinary decision announced by defense minister Alberto Otárola suspended several civil liberties, including the right to assembly and freedom of transit.Castillo’s supporters took to the streets in protest immediately after his former vice president Dina Boluarte was sworn in as his successor in early December. The protestors claim that the country’s political and financial elite never gave Castillo, Peru’s first indigenous president and a political outsider, a chance to successfully govern, and that the national congress acted unlawfully in removing Castillo from power.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe protests are supported by the country’s largest association of indigenous groups and the national federation of labor unions, a base reflective of the coalition that originally propelled Castillo into office.Born to illiterate farmers in a rural, impoverished community, Castillo ran for president on the slogan “no more poor people in a rich country,” vowing to redistribute the profits of international mining companies and other foreign companies operating in Peru to the country’s poor.The fifth president in just four years, Boluarte must find a way to rally support and stabilize the country’s political institutions. As she considers calling for new elections in 2023, a recent Ipsos poll had her approval rating at just 21%, six percentage points lower than the final poll of Castillo’s term.The rural/urban divideCastillo is just the second Peruvian president since 1956 born outside of Lima, the wealthy capital city. Much of his political support is found in the country’s rural areas. In the first round of the election, he won just 18% of the national vote, but received more than 50% of the vote in Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Hiancavelicia. These three southern regions are home to some of the largest copper and gold deposits in the world, yet remain the poorest in Peru.Story continuesDuring his presidential campaign, Castillo openly attacked foreign mining companies, promising environmental regulations, higher taxes, and wealth redistribution. After he was elected, foreign mining companies experienced months-long strikes and road blockades that paralyzed production and prompted deadly clashes between protestors and police.Notably, the major Chinese mining company MMG was forced to declare force majure after protestors shut down all operations at the Las Bambas mine, responsible for 2% of the world’s copper production. In response to these extended labor actions, foreign investors fled and the credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Peru from an A3 rating to Baa1, the country’s lowest since 2011, warning of weakened policymaking capacity and a “fractured political environment.”Castillo was removed from office in December for attempting to form a provisional government and draft a new constitution. Within the day, he was impeached and detained on charges of treason.Now, with tensions only heightened since his removal, the new administration must balance the country’s needs for economic growth and political stability while trying to appease Castillo’s newly-energized supporters.Mining in the Peruvian Andes, by the numbers:60%: Mining’s percentage of Peru’s total exports.$53 billion: Estimate of lost profits for foreign mining companies because of strikes and other work stoppages during the summer of 2022.25%: The percentage of Peruvians currently living in poverty.51%: The proportion of Peruvians suffering from food insecurity.$3.67: Average hourly wage for a worker in a Peruvian mine.

You can skip our detailed industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy Heading Into 2023.The defense industry consists of the development, manufacturing, and sales of air-based, land-based, and sea-based military support and auxiliary equipment such as satellites, sonars, radars, etc. The defense sector is extremely important for countries around the world, as strong military prowess often amounts to a strong influence over other countries and organizations.Spending in the defense sector has recently been a subject of contention, with many people arguing that military expenditure is often wasteful and could be better spent on other priorities, such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure. On the other hand, many people term high levels of defense spending to be necessary to ensure the security and stability of a country, and the war in Ukraine certainly solidified this view as it became a tailwind for defense spending across the world. The global defense market was valued at $452.69 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% to $604.82 billion in 2026. China, India, The United States, The U.K., and Russia remain the chief contributor to global military spending, accounting for about 62% of the total military spend in 2021. In addition, global military spending surpassed $2 trillion for the first time in 2021.Just like all other industries, technology and, in particular, artificial intelligence has had a major impact on the defense sector. In 2021, The U.S. Army gave contracts for the development of robot combat vehicles that will be able to fight alongside infantry and will have the necessary tools to even take on armored personnel carriers, trucks, and troops. Corporations that develop and manufacture air-based defense systems are increasingly investing in autonomous fighter jets that will be able to conduct tasks such as collecting information or engaging with a potential threat without the need for a human pilot.Story continuesOur MethodologyTo come up with 11 best defensive defense stocks to buy heading into 2023 we have picked companies operating in the defense sector that are currently paying dividends to investors.

Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximately 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments.

In addition, we are seeing evidence from other companies in the companion animal market that elevated inflation and recessionary fears are causing consumers to pull back on discretionary pet spending, resulting in fewer clinical veterinarian visits.""Photo by Karlo Tottoc on UnsplashZoetis Inc.

The copper-rich country's currency jumped as much as 2.6% at 844.9 per dollar, last up 0.6% in afternoon trading. It touched its strongest level since Sept. 5. News that Chile's central bank would extend its forward dollar sales operations program to June from a previously announced end date of January boosted the currency in the previous session. Brightening the mood further on Wednesday, copper prices hit two-week peaks as top consumer China's easing of COVID restrictions spurred buying of the metal despite a rise in infection there. The Brazilian real gained 0.6% and the Mexican peso held ground against the dollar even as data showed Brazil created fewer formal jobs than expected in November, while another set showed Mexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate eased to 3% in November from 3.2% in the previous month.

Workers demanded better safety conditions, higher wages, and more environmental regulation.A month-long state of emergency has been declared in Peru after supporters of Pedro Castillo—the imprisoned former president—blocked roads, closed airports, and ratcheted up pressure on the country’s new government. The extraordinary decision announced by defense minister Alberto Otárola suspended several civil liberties, including the right to assembly and freedom of transit.Castillo’s supporters took to the streets in protest immediately after his former vice president Dina Boluarte was sworn in as his successor in early December. The protestors claim that the country’s political and financial elite never gave Castillo, Peru’s first indigenous president and a political outsider, a chance to successfully govern, and that the national congress acted unlawfully in removing Castillo from power.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe protests are supported by the country’s largest association of indigenous groups and the national federation of labor unions, a base reflective of the coalition that originally propelled Castillo into office.Born to illiterate farmers in a rural, impoverished community, Castillo ran for president on the slogan “no more poor people in a rich country,” vowing to redistribute the profits of international mining companies and other foreign companies operating in Peru to the country’s poor.The fifth president in just four years, Boluarte must find a way to rally support and stabilize the country’s political institutions. As she considers calling for new elections in 2023, a recent Ipsos poll had her approval rating at just 21%, six percentage points lower than the final poll of Castillo’s term.The rural/urban divideCastillo is just the second Peruvian president since 1956 born outside of Lima, the wealthy capital city. Much of his political support is found in the country’s rural areas. In the first round of the election, he won just 18% of the national vote, but received more than 50% of the vote in Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Hiancavelicia. These three southern regions are home to some of the largest copper and gold deposits in the world, yet remain the poorest in Peru.Story continuesDuring his presidential campaign, Castillo openly attacked foreign mining companies, promising environmental regulations, higher taxes, and wealth redistribution. After he was elected, foreign mining companies experienced months-long strikes and road blockades that paralyzed production and prompted deadly clashes between protestors and police.Notably, the major Chinese mining company MMG was forced to declare force majure after protestors shut down all operations at the Las Bambas mine, responsible for 2% of the world’s copper production. In response to these extended labor actions, foreign investors fled and the credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Peru from an A3 rating to Baa1, the country’s lowest since 2011, warning of weakened policymaking capacity and a “fractured political environment.”Castillo was removed from office in December for attempting to form a provisional government and draft a new constitution. Within the day, he was impeached and detained on charges of treason.Now, with tensions only heightened since his removal, the new administration must balance the country’s needs for economic growth and political stability while trying to appease Castillo’s newly-energized supporters.Mining in the Peruvian Andes, by the numbers:60%: Mining’s percentage of Peru’s total exports.$53 billion: Estimate of lost profits for foreign mining companies because of strikes and other work stoppages during the summer of 2022.25%: The percentage of Peruvians currently living in poverty.51%: The proportion of Peruvians suffering from food insecurity.$3.67: Average hourly wage for a worker in a Peruvian mine.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82 on December 23, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 176.44 points or 0.5% higher at 33,203.93. However, on December 27, stocks posted mixed performance, as yields rose and investors focused on the economic outlook for 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2% and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%. Stocks with deep links to the Chinese economy jumped as Covid restrictions loosened in the Asian region. Yields also propelled higher, which pressured growth stocks. Stocks are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008 and another month of losses, with the Dow and S&amp;P off by 8.2% and 19.4%, respectively, while the Nasdaq’s fell 34.4% year-to-date as of December 27. During December, the S&amp;P has plunged 5.9%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have plummeted 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively. The major averages are on their way for the largest monthly drops since September. Keith Lerner, Truist’s co-chief investment officer, noted: “It’s basically the continuation of high yields depressing growth, with redistribution into other sectors that are smaller, but not big enough to change the headline index.”With this market outlook in mind, investors are looking to buy stocks which have posted share price gains this year, in order to construct a well balanced portfolio. While some traders seek get-rich-quick stocks (see 12 Best Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy), others tend to gravitate towards stable dividend payers as a hedge against market turbulence (see 12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500). Although investors usually pile into the likes of stable income stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to navigate the volatile economic backdrop, another way to combat the consistently battered stock market is to invest in equities which have outperformed benchmark indices significantly and offer meaningful growth potential.  Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the NASDAQ stocks that offer year-to-date share price gains of more than 100% as of December 27.

On January 18, 2022 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to purchase ATVI for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. The Fund has been invested in ATVI since the second quarter of 2018.The investment thesis was threefold. First, the greater than $200 billion gaming industry is the largest and fastest growing form of entertainment in the world. More than three billion people play games currently and the population of global gamers is expected to grow faster than global population growth this decade.14 Second, ATVI has some of the best intellectual property in the gaming industry including Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. Third, ATVI has had a pristine balance sheet with net cash over the past four years, generated robust free cash flow and traded at an undemanding valuation.ATVI closed the quarter at $80.11—a nearly 16% discount to the acquisition price. Assuming it takes about a year for the deal to close, a 18.6% return seems to be good upside relative to the risk of a deal not closing due to anti -trust concerns. If the transaction closes it would make Microsoft the third-largest company in gaming by revenue behind Tencent and Sony. There is plenty of competition from these larger players as well as smaller competitors such as EA, Take-Two Interactive, Roblox and Epic Games’ Fortnite. The Fund remains invested in ATVI given the significant discount, but should the discount narrow in the coming quarters the Fund could reduce or eliminate the position.”6.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $10.The past two years have been challenging for the biotech sector, based on the market performance of biotech equities. Compared to larger stock market indexes, biotechnology indices underperformed. Now it appears as though the tables are turning. Prices for biotech stocks have stabilized, and a rebound is possible. In the middle of June 2022, the biotech stock bear market most likely reached its bottom. According to the Nasdaq Biotech Index (NBI), the sector recovered almost 30% from that low between mid-June and mid-August; however, the upward trend has since slightly slowed. The industry prognosis is nonetheless optimistic for the remainder of the current year and the following year. This is because many biotech companies are in strong financial and strategic positions.As reported by Bloomberg, several ground-breaking discoveries are in the process and are likely to boost market potential in the specified disease categories. The number of new medicine approvals is expected to increase due to favorable regulatory conditions and an increase in clinical trial submissions to the FDA. The level of innovation has been pretty astounding; discoveries are being made, and new items are reaching the market faster. Good return potential is correlated with attractive stock values. In any case, given its distinct characteristics, the biotech sector ought to be included in diversified investment portfolios. The current stock prices offer an opportunity to add to or start new long-term holdings in the biotech industry.The sector is likely to be shielded from the general challenges of higher interest rates by increasing M&amp;A activity and a robust innovation pipeline. Experts believe that there is a significant probability that big, cash-rich pharmaceutical corporations will continue to bolster their R&amp;D pipelines as 2022 comes to a conclusion and into 2023. Numerous factors are going to increase mergers and acquisition activity. This year, many biotech businesses have provided encouraging clinical data. The new approvals front has seen a lot of activity from biotech companies.Story continuesCurrently, the political climate is favorable for the biotech industry. In the US, the largest drug market in the world, the recently approved Inflation Reduction Act in Washington will not impose any price caps on cutting-edge medications. This encourages innovation and stimulates big pharma's interest in appealing biotech firms. Buyers looking to overcome a patent cliff quickly will be particularly interested in companies that have just launched or are about to launch their first products based on ground-breaking innovations. According to the deals publicized this year, oncology remains the most crucial therapeutic field for potential buyers. Smaller biotech companies have also successfully developed new treatments for schizophrenia and depression in neurology over the past few years.12 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $10Photo by CDC on UnsplashOur Methodology: In order to compile our list of the 12 best biotech stocks under $10 we used overall hedge fund towards biotech stocks that are under $10.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Medtronic The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.82bUS$6.10bUS$5.78bUS$6.93bUS$7.40bUS$7.76bUS$8.07bUS$8.35bUS$8.59bUS$8.82bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.86%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$4.5kUS$5.0kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$46bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.0%) = US$135bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$135b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$59bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$105b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$76.3, the company appears about fair value at a 3.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.022. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth.

In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$111, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Merck as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MerckStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Earlier in the quarter, the Colonsay potash mine was temporarily idled as a result of the slower-than-expected recovery in demand.Phosphate sales volumes are now expected to be in the range of 1.5-1.7 million tonnes. Guidance for realized DAP prices on an FOB basis remains unchanged at $700-$750 per tonne. In addition to slower markets, lingering issues stemming from Hurricane Ian have continued longer than previously expected. Repairs to sulfuric acid plants supporting production at the Bartow facility are now expected to be completed early in the first quarter of 2023.While demand recovery for both phosphates and potash has been slowed by seasonality in late 2022, Mosaic anticipates 2023 to be a strong year for nutrient application, supported by historically strong crop prices and constructive grower economics.

WMB need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $3 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for The Williams Companies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, The Williams Companies is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 46 cents per share to 47 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about The Williams Companies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

162,85f70bf3-74c3-3099-bbdc-61d84381d1f7,BA,2022-12-29,Column: Southwest's meltdown was born in America's cheapskate corporate culture,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-southwests-meltdown-born-americas-212720294.html,1672262840,STORY,"['LUV', 'BA']","[Southwest passenger Amanda Gevorgyan looks for her luggage among hundreds of bags from Southwest Airlines flight cancellations at LAX. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)Through much of 2022, the most often asked questions about Southwest Airlines concerned issues such as whether it would allow preassigned seating, start charging for all checked baggage and institute change fees — scrapping all those policies that have made the airline unique.Today, the question on Southwest passengers' minds is: Will its planes get in the air at all?Southwest's yuletide meltdown has been so widely publicized that it doesn't require a lengthy recap. Suffice to say that Wednesday, as I write, its 2,508 flight cancellations account for 90% of all domestic flight cancellations in the U.S. (The statistics are from FlightAware.)We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.Southwest CEO Bob JordanOn Tuesday, Southwest accounted for about 84% of the more than 3,200 domestic flight cancellations.That trend implies that as the country's other air carriers have begun to work out their own traffic snarls resulting from the massive ""bomb cyclone"" that struck the U.S. starting on the day before Christmas, Southwest remains mired in disaster. The airline says it will take days to work its way out.One can't blame Southwest for the magnitude of the storm, obviously.One can, however, examine why the airline has done so much worse than its rivals, why the other carriers didn't do so well either, and why American companies generally get caught so often with their pants down when operating conditions materialize on the edge of — or outside — normal expectations.The short answer is their underinvestment in preparation and planning. For decades, Big Business has been squandering its resources on handouts to shareholders instead of spending on workers and infrastructure. There's not enough give in the system, so when crisis comes, it doesn't bend, but breaks.What drives this tendency is economics. Business managements have become hostages to cost-cutting, squeezing expenses out of their systems in every way possible, trusting to luck that what works under normal conditions will continue to work when the outside world goes haywire. They're betting their companies on a bad strategy.Story continuesThere are numerous manifestations of this cheeseparing habit. One is just-in-time production, which spread like wildfire from Toyota, where it originated in the 1980s, to the rest of the automobile industry and eventually to the manufacturing sector generally.The idea was to slash waste by coordinating inventories of parts, the supply of workers and the time for production so that everything was in place when needed and not a minute before or after.The pace of work sped up, workers were squeezed on wages and hours, parts suppliers operated on ever-narrower margins. It all worked fine, until it didn't.The dream of a production line ""inherently flexible, inventoryless, even computerless, replenished by infinitely responsive suppliers"" was too simple, Uday Karmarkar, an expert in manufacturing strategy and technology at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, observed as long ago as 1989. ""Just-in-time manufacturing is producing revolutionaries who don’t know when to stop.""Beginning in the summer of 2021, logjams in the global supply chain, compounded by a surge in post-pandemic goods orders from consumers returning to shops, left manufacturers without needed parts and retailers without merchandise.Only since that crisis erupted have manufacturers recognized that they need to move away from just-in-time to just-in-case — that is, keeping more parts inventory on-site and more workers, with better training, on call.Another manifestation is outsourcing. Boeing could have learned the lesson that outsourcing can increase costs and place a heavy burden on management from its experience with its 787 Dreamliner.The next-generation aircraft came in billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule when it finally began to fly commercially in 2011, in part because Boeing farmed out more of the work to foreign contractors.Some of the pieces manufactured by far-flung suppliers didn’t fit together. Some subcontractors couldn’t meet their output quotas, creating huge production logjams when crucial parts weren’t available in the necessary sequence.“We gave work to people that had never really done this kind of technology before, and then we didn’t provide the oversight that was necessary,” Jim Albaugh, then the company’s commercial aviation chief, acknowledged. “The pendulum swung too far.”Yet Boeing pursued an outsourcing strategy for crucial systems in its 737 Max. After the plane suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 because of malfunctioning software, leading to a years-long grounding by aeronautics regulators around the world, Bloomberg reported that Boeing had outsourced its software development to overseas firms employing engineers for as little as $9 an hour.The company maintained that it was fully capable of supervising the foreign software engineers' work. The Max is back in the air now and rolling out to customers, the largest of which is Southwest Airlines.That brings us back to the Southwest meltdown. A full explanation may not emerge for some time, but it's possible to identify some contributing factors.One is the airline's practice of operating with the tightest of operational constraints. Southwest has long prided itself on its short turnaround times between landings and takeoffs, aimed at maximizing the efficiency of its fleet and sometimes mandating turns as brief as 35 minutes.Yet this is not the first time that the practice produced disaster. That would be 2014, when the carrier's on-time performance suddenly cratered. The problem was that Southwest decided to cram many more flights into its schedule without expanding its aircraft fleet.Its confidence stemmed from a relatively trouble-free performance during 2012, which was a mild weather year. But it soon became clear that the schedule’s demanding tolerances could be met only on days with near-perfect weather and no mechanical mishaps.The airline built more flexibility into its schedule after that, but other factors came into play during the last week. They include Southwest's point-to-point flight map, which differs from the hub-and-spoke configuration of other major carriers such as United and Delta, which concentrate operations at large regional airports such as Chicago and Atlanta.That simplifies the challenge of coordinating aircraft and crews so they're in place together, limiting (if not eliminating) the chance that local or regional weather crises will affect flights nationwide.Southwest doesn't have the same coordination capacity — and according to employees, its complex point-to-point system requires more robust scheduling technology than it has implemented.""Our internal scheduling software can’t handle massive cancellations,"" Michael Santoro, vice president of the Southwest pilots union, told my colleague Margot Roosevelt in an interview. ""The company hasn’t invested the money into scheduling infrastructure to support the network they have developed.”The outdated system is unequipped to handle rerouting involved in hundreds of cancellations, Santoro said. “So pilots are calling in asking, 'I’m done with this flight — where do I go next? Am I running another plane? Do I spend the night here?' And pilots are on hold for hours trying to figure out what to do next.”When the weather is perfect, the software matches crews to planes. “But when there’s a disruption like this storm, our system can’t handle it,"" Michael Massoni, first vice president of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest flight attendants, told Roosevelt.""Southwest loses control because we don’t have 21st century technology. So what happens is chaos. Southwest starts to deal with the problem manually, which is incredibly tedious.”Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan acknowledged the software scheduling problem in a message to Southwest employees obtained by CNN.“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan said. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”What has the airline been spending money on, if not mission-critical corporate infrastructure? On dividends and stock buybacks, which flow directly to shareholders.Early in December, the airline announced that it would reinstate its dividend — suspended during the pandemic — by paying 18 cents a share to investors in early January. The payout will cost nearly $107 million. Since 2015, the company has paid out about $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased more than $8 billion in shares — that is, handouts to shareholders.The dividend resumption may be cold comfort to Southwest stockholders, who have seen their shares sink in value by about 28% this year and by more than 18% just since Thanksgiving.But it will send a chillier wind at its passengers, thousands of whom have been stranded at airports with no guarantee that they will be granted a seat on a Southwest flight for days to come and who may wish that Jordan stopped talking about modernizing the airline, and started acting.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Boeing (BA).Boeing currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.25 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 8.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for BACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Boeing here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Boeing, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in BA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Boeing, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$8.78.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Boeing. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Boeing.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Estimates for the fourth quarter and current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share have moved north over the past month to $2.28 and 8.46, respectively. Projected FFO per share growth rates for the fourth quarter and 2022 are 20.0% and 20.7%, respectively.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. Rather, the pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues.This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $200 to $250 million and acquisitions of $213 million for 2022. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.The company completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 Smart Home packages in the third quarter. In 2022, MAA plans to complete more than 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, management projects the total number of smart units to reach 70,000.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of MAA’s redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.60% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.78%, reflecting that MAA is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. Recently, MAA’s board of directors approved an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend payment. The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023.The recent hike reflects MAA’s ability to generate solid income through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. The company increased its dividend seven times in the past five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.However, inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes are expected to push property operating expenses higher. Also, rate hikes add to the company’s woes.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc. VICI and Lamar Advertising Company LAMR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ 2022 FFO per share has moved 4.9% north to $1.92 over the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamar Advertising Company’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 1.4% over the past two months to $7.34.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy Heading Into 2023.The defense industry consists of the development, manufacturing, and sales of air-based, land-based, and sea-based military support and auxiliary equipment such as satellites, sonars, radars, etc. The defense sector is extremely important for countries around the world, as strong military prowess often amounts to a strong influence over other countries and organizations.Spending in the defense sector has recently been a subject of contention, with many people arguing that military expenditure is often wasteful and could be better spent on other priorities, such as healthcare, education, or infrastructure. On the other hand, many people term high levels of defense spending to be necessary to ensure the security and stability of a country, and the war in Ukraine certainly solidified this view as it became a tailwind for defense spending across the world. The global defense market was valued at $452.69 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% to $604.82 billion in 2026. China, India, The United States, The U.K., and Russia remain the chief contributor to global military spending, accounting for about 62% of the total military spend in 2021. In addition, global military spending surpassed $2 trillion for the first time in 2021.Just like all other industries, technology and, in particular, artificial intelligence has had a major impact on the defense sector. In 2021, The U.S. Army gave contracts for the development of robot combat vehicles that will be able to fight alongside infantry and will have the necessary tools to even take on armored personnel carriers, trucks, and troops. Corporations that develop and manufacture air-based defense systems are increasingly investing in autonomous fighter jets that will be able to conduct tasks such as collecting information or engaging with a potential threat without the need for a human pilot.Story continuesOur MethodologyTo come up with 11 best defensive defense stocks to buy heading into 2023 we have picked companies operating in the defense sector that are currently paying dividends to investors. We have ranked the companies in ascending order of their forward annual dividend yields. Defense companies are often viewed as value companies that provide steady returns to shareholders via dividends.11 Best Defensive Defense Stocks to Buy Heading Into 202311. Woodward, Inc.

The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximately 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. General Dynamics (GD) earns a Zacks Rank #3 28 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 25, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.57 a share.GD has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.57 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55.GD is just one of a large group of Aerospace stocks with a positive ESP figure. Northrop Grumman (NOC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on January 26, 2023, Northrop Grumman holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $6.72 a share 29 days from its next quarterly update.Northrop Grumman's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.81% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.60.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GD and NOC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

But there is at least one bright spot for Eastbay lovers: You can still score some great deals — if you act fast.See: What Are the Best Months To Purchase Clothing in 2023?Holiday Return Policies: Learn New Rules and DeadlinesEastbay announced the news on its website with the following statement: “We’re saying goodbye to Eastbay at the end of December 2022. We encourage you to shop at champssports.com to find great deals for your athletic shoes, clothing, and more.”As Footwear News reported, Eastbay was founded in 1980 by Art Juedes and Rick Gering, a pair of high school coaches who started out traveling around Wisconsin selling shoes directly to athletes. The company eventually expanded into athletic footwear, apparel and sports equipment, and its direct-mail catalog became a ’90s must-have for sneakerheads.In a 2019 interview with the Los Angeles Times, NBA star and devoted sneakerhead P.J. Tucker called Eastbay “my bible as a kid.” Even though Tucker couldn’t afford most of the merch growing up, his free subscription to Eastbay taught him everything he needed to know about athletic shoes and gear.A tweet from “The Sneaker Game” host Nick DePaula shared similar sentiment for the brand, saying in part, “I grew up reading Eastbay with my cereal every morning — and it’s how I learned all about the sneaker industry. For everyone growing up in the 90s, we owe a huge thanks to Eastbay for sparking that love for sneakers early on.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Here’s how the Get Up! website described the impact Eastbay had on young consumers: “Bring an Eastbay magazine to class, and everyone began hoping and wishing which shoe they could claim as their own.”Eastbay became such a hit that Foot Locker acquired the company in 1997. But things changed in June 2022, when Foot Locker signed a deal to sell its team sales business to BSN Sports, a division of Varsity Brands. Foot Locker also said it would consolidate the Eastbay.com retail website into the Champs Sports banner, completing the integration of the banners that began in 2019, Footwear News reported.Story continuesLearn: 10 Things To Stop Buying in 2023Find: 6 Sports You Can Take Up for Less Than $500If you’re an Eastbay devotee, there’s still time to buy merchandise — and at cut-rate prices.

(NYSE:PFE) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Pfizer The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PfizerIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Mikael Dohlsten, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.36 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$50.80, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 16% of Mikael Dohlsten's holding.In the last year Pfizer insiders didn't buy any company stock.

If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Pfizer Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Pfizer insiders own about US$124m worth of shares (which is 0.04% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Pfizer Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Pfizer shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Pfizer insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Pfizer.

In November, the U.S. health regulator approved the first gene therapy, CSL Ltd and uniQure's Hemgenix, to treat hemophilia B.Pfizer is also testing other experimental gene therapies in late-stage trials as potential treatments for the bleeding disorder hemophilia A and muscular disorder Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 BENEGENE-2 study (NCT03861273) evaluating fidanacogene elaparvovec, an investigational gene therapy, for the treatment of adult males with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B.The BENEGENE-2 study met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority and superiority in the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of total bleeds post-fidanacogene elaparvovec infusion versus prophylaxis regimen with Factor IX (FIX), administered as part of usual care. The results demonstrated superiority with a mean ABR for all bleeds of 1.3 for the 12 months from week 12 to month 15 compared to an ABR of 4.43 during the lead-in pre-treatment period of at least six months, resulting in a 71% reduction in ABR (p&lt;0.0001) after a single dose of 5e11 vg/kg of fidanacogene elaparvovec. Key secondary endpoints demonstrated a 78% reduction in treated ABR (p=0.0001) and a 92% reduction in annualized infusion rate (p&lt;0.0001). Mean FIX activity was 27% at 15 months by one-stage SynthASil assay and 25% at 24 months. The mean steady-state FIX:C was significantly higher than the pre-specified threshold of 5% (p&lt;0.0001).Fidanacogene elaparvovec was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with Phase 1/2 results. Fourteen serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in seven (16%) patients, with two assessed as related to treatment, a duodenal ulcer hemorrhage occurring in the setting of corticosteroid use, and an immune-mediated elevation of liver aminotransferase levels. No deaths, SAEs associated with infusion reactions, thrombotic events, or FIX inhibitors were reported.Fidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel, investigational vector that contains a bio-engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid (protein shell) and a high-activity human coagulation FIX gene. The goal of this gene therapy for people living with hemophilia B, once treated, is that they will be able to produce FIX via this one-time treatment rather than having to regularly receive exogenous FIX. In this Phase 3 trial, eligible study participants (n=45) completed a minimum six months of routine exogeneous FIX prophylaxis therapy during the lead-in study (NCT03587116) and then received one intravenous dose of fidanacogene elaparvovec at a dose of 5e11 vg/kg. Participants in the BENEGENE-2 study were screened with a validated assay designed to identify individuals who test negative for neutralizing antibodies to the gene therapy vector. Clinical trial participants will be evaluated as part of a long-term study over the course of 15 years.Story continues""Pfizer has more than 30 years of experience in developing and commercializing therapies for hematological disorders, and a deep understanding of the significant challenges that people living with hemophilia continually face. We are proud to advance the latest innovation for people living with hemophilia B and are encouraged by the potential of this investigational gene therapy,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We are extremely appreciative of those who are participating in the trial and to the investigators contributing to this innovative research as we work to unlock the full potential of gene therapies for people living with hemophilia.""Pfizer currently has three Phase 3 programs investigating gene therapy in populations where there is a high unmet need: hemophilia B, hemophilia A, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A Phase 3 trial is also ongoing investigating marstacimab, a potential novel subcutaneous therapy option being studied for the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors.""The burden people living with hemophilia B face is significant, with many receiving routine infusions or injections which can interfere with their ability to take part in day-to-day activities that many take for granted,"" said Adam Cuker, M.D., M.S., Director, Penn Comprehensive and Hemophilia Thrombosis Program. ""The BENEGENE-2 data demonstrate the promise of this gene therapy candidate as a potential one-time option for people living with hemophilia B as a means of reducing the clinical and treatment burden over the long term.""Fidanacogene elaparvovec has been granted breakthrough, regenerative medicines advance therapy (RMAT), and orphan drug designations from the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) and orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency. Pfizer will discuss these data with regulatory authorities in early 2023.Additional key data will be presented at a scientific conference in early 2023 as well.About fidanacogene elaparvovecFidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel, investigational gene therapy that contains a bio-engineered AAV capsid and a high-activity human coagulation FIX gene. The goal of this investigational treatment for people living with hemophilia B, once treated, is that they will be able to produce FIX themselves via this one-time treatment rather than having to receive exogenous FIX.Pfizer licensed SPK-9001 (fidanacogene elaparvovec), from Spark Therapeutics pursuant to a December 2014 agreement under which Spark Therapeutics was responsible for conducting all Phase 1/2 studies for the investigational gene therapy while Pfizer assumed responsibility for pivotal studies, any regulatory activities, and potential global commercialization.About Hemophilia BHemophilia, a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to take a long time to clot because of a deficiency in one of several blood clotting factors, is almost exclusively found in males. People with hemophilia are at risk for excessive and recurrent bleeding from modest injuries, which have the potential to be life threatening. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints, or rarely into other critical closed spaces such as the intracranial space, where bleeding can be fatal.According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, more than 38,000 people worldwide were living with hemophilia B in 2021. People with hemophilia B have a deficiency in clotting FIX, a specific protein in the blood. Hemophilia B also is called congenital FIX deficiency or Christmas disease. The current standard of care requires recurrent intravenous infusions of either plasma-derived or recombinant FIX to control and prevent bleeding episodes.Pfizer Inc.: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Biotech Stocks in 2022. Fitch Ratings has assigned a Neutral rating to the global pharmaceutical and biotech industry, which indicates the assumption of a collaborative operating backdrop in 2023, although inflationary pressures and a tight interest rate environment will still persist. Fitch expects demand in the global biotech industry to normalize as fundamentals yet again are pointing towards innovation and growth. This outlook is also supported by feasible secular trends like an increasing and aging global population, high prevalence of chronic diseases, and easier healthcare accessibility worldwide. From 2015 through 2021, biotech saw drastic revenue generation and strong financing. There was meaningful top-line growth in 2021 as public company revenues climbed 35%, from $160.2 billion to $216.7 billion, largely due to COVID-19 medications and vaccines. While retail and hospitality sectors declined, capital invested in biotech startups, IPOs, and financing innovation reached an all-time high of $104.7 billion in February 2021. In 2020 and 2021, 50 new molecular entities were authorized by the FDA, an increase from an annual total of 29 a decade earlier. Presently, biotechs account for 65% of the approximately 6,000 clinical asset candidates in active development, and this ratio is forecasted to experience drastic growth over the next 10 years.However, despite an uncertain economic backdrop heading into 2023, biotech alliances continue to emerge, and mergers and acquisitions are typically supported as the industry needs to elevate growth even amid global economic and fiscal slowdowns. For well-rounded exposure to the biotech industry, investors should focus on the countries which are making the biggest strides in the sector. (see 12 Most Advanced Countries in Biotechnology) It is also important to find stocks which offer upside potential for future gains (see 10 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside). Story continuesWhile investors usually pick up popular stocks like Pfizer Inc.

Of the three indexes, the NASDAQ 100 has fared the worst, declining 33.8% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating recession fears. The founder of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates, Louis Navellier, also commented on how over low volumes, the equity market is trying its best to maintain its “head above water after a disappointing start to the official Santa Claus rally.” The billionaire investor thinks that since the hardest-hit industries are engaging in some bottom fishing, there has been some regression to the mean.As per the National Association of Realtors, pending home sales decreased by 4.0% on a monthly basis in November. These statistics were among the economic data released on December 28. The decline occurred due to prospective buyers being concerned about high mortgage rates. A loss of 1.8% had been predicted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. According to Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, there are unmistakable signals that the economy is faltering, as indicated by pending home sales plummeting to the second-lowest level in history. Historically, the sale of new homes has been a significant catalyst for economic activity because it supports numerous industries.Despite the current bearish economic environment, numerous mid to large-capitalization companies recorded significant trading volumes over the last three months. Investors have had various reasons to engage in active trading of companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

The company came into the limelight after developing the COVID-19 vaccine.Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) intends to roll out first-of-its-kind vaccines to combat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The company also plans to launch a flu vaccine that leverages the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine delivery mechanism. Furthermore, 2023 will be the first year the COVID-19 vaccine will be available widely on the commercial market. Previously, the availability of COVID-19 was covered by public institutions and inter-governmental agencies. The positive sentiment on Pfizer Inc.

Although Pfizer continues to report strong performance of its core drugs, sales of its COVID vaccine and treatment have likely peaked and sales are expected to decline going forward. We remain optimistic about the company long term as we believe management is taking the company in the right direction, focusing R&amp;D, and making strategic acquisitions with profits generated from COVID vaccine sales.”11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Average 3-Month Volume: 24.37 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco, California-based tech company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.The company has a 70% market share in the US ride-hailing industry. Despite making significant progress in achieving higher growth and profitability, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stock is currently trading 40% below its IPO price. The company holds a total addressable market (TAM) of $13.8 trillion, with mobility and delivery businesses having a TAM of $5 trillion each, while Uber Freight has a TAM of $3.8 trillion. The rising inflation is also expected to increase the demand for ride-hailing services as it would become more challenging for people to buy cars. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is focusing on generating consistent cash flows through the introduction of subscription-based Uber One services. Despite the weakness in stock price performance, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has experienced a stellar 26% YoY growth in gross bookings during Q3 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Funds shared its stance on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Here’s what the firm said:“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results, and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings, up 55% year over year, and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth, up 7% year over year. Overall, revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion, generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA, up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly, FCF was positive at $382 million, up $780 million year over year, and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth.UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as grocery delivery, truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt, the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”10.

The Chinese New Year festivities are expected to start on January 22. Based on these developments, the analyst anticipates Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) to experience a growth in customer management revenue (CMR) as the reopening of the Chinese economy boosts demand.Here’s what Polen Capital said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the leading e-commerce company in China. The stock was weak over the quarter as they reported a quarterly revenue decline. The company has been heavily impacted by the continued covid-19 lockdowns throughout China and the aggressive rate increases and deteriorating outlook for China’s economy have weighed heavily on the stock. The share price has also been under pressure due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s plans to delist Chinese tech stocks in 2024 if they do not provide access to audit files.”9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Average 3-Month Volume: 30.55 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 269Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Seattle, Washington-based diversified technology company with exposure to consumer electronics, cloud computing services, computer hardware, and software.On December 24, Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley shortlisted the company as a top pick in the field of software. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to experience growth in the cloud, data management, and security sectors. The company has also emerged as a top candidate for acquiring the California-based open-source tool provider for cloud-computing infrastructure, HashiCorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCP). Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also working on closing the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition deal that was announced in January 2022.

Fiscal fourth quarter results were generally in line with consensus estimates, though profits missed slightly. While its Azure cloud business continues to perform well, the personal computer market has declined with inflation having an impact. Its shares experienced a -9% selloff.”8. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)Average 3-Month Volume: 32.43 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 196Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a Mountain View, California-based holding company that owns Google, YouTube, and numerous other subsidiaries.Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI assigned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock a target price of $120 along with an Outperform rating, implying a potential upside of over 37% from the closing price as of December 27. The analyst sees Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock as an attractive play for long-term investors. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is said to have paid $2.5 billion to get the rights to the Sunday Ticket subscription service for YouTube. This development is expected to result in an expansion in the paid subscriber base of YouTube TV.Here’s what Mayar Capital said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In early January this year – which admittedly feels like eons ago – US President Joe Biden was pushing Americans to take up the government’s offer of free COVID tests to help tackle the surging omicron variant. How did Biden respond when citizens asked about the availability of these tests?“Google it!”This advice, undoubtedly well-meant, was roundly scoffed at by the press, however. It seemed too obvious to be very helpful.Anyway, the anecdote serves to introduce you to one of our largest holdings, Alphabet; the parent company of Google. Note that first, Alphabet’s original and core product – its search engine – has entered our common vocabulary as a verb. ‘Googling’ something has the same meaning as ‘researching’ or ‘finding an answer to’ something. Second the reason Biden’s advice was met with such opprobrium was because Googling something has become almost second nature to us now.These two observations reveal a lot about Google’s strength in the search engine market, in which it has a share of over 90 percent. Because internet search is almost the prototypical network, Google has benefitted from – and we think is also protected by – the huge competitive advantage its scale brings – both to those asking the questions and those providing the answers. The Google search platform becomes increasingly useful to anyone seeking information as a greater volume of stuff becomes available. This starts a virtuous cycle that results in a colossal market share for Google itself. In the language of business strategists, Google benefits from vast network effects.Because Google’s search results are viewed by billions of eyeballs every day, its search page ‘real estate’ is understandably very valuable to those with goods and services to sell. Advertising revenues from this ‘real estate’ as well as that from its other properties such as Mail, Maps, and so on, totaled almost USD 150b in 2021; amounting to almost 58% of the company’s revenues. Ad sales on YouTube, also owned by Alphabet, brought in another USD 28b. With the secular shift of the advertising spend to digital channels – over which Alphabet has a tight grip – we estimate the company has a share of around 40% of the digital advertising market and is probably the most valuable advertising property in the world…” (Click here to see the full text)7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Average 3-Month Volume: 41.72 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a Charlotte, North Carolina-based provider of asset management, banking, investing, and other diversified financial services.The increase in benchmark interest rates by the Federal Reserve will play out favorably for Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) as the banking giant would be able to charge a higher markup on its loans. The US Federal Reserve anticipates a soft landing of the economy as it projects a GDP growth of 0.5% in 2023. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve anticipates the interest rate to peak at around 5.1% as opposed to the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%. In case of a recession, experts think the banking system is more prepared to counter the impact as compared to the Financial Crisis of 2008, as the loan-to-deposit rate sits at 70% as opposed to 100% previously.Ariel Investments shared its outlook on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We initiated three new positions in the quarter. We added leading financial institution Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) which serves individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses, and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management, and other financial and risk management products and services. The current company was formed through various mergers including NationsBank, FleetBoston, US Trust, Countrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch with the legacy commercial bank to form a national banking powerhouse and bulge bracket investment firm. As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”6. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Average 3-Month Volume: 45.91 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 177Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park, California-based diversified technology company with a foothold in the instant messaging (IM) and social media industry.As of December 2022, Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) is also aggressively rolling out its Reel feature to combat the rise of TikTok. The company claims that 140 billion reels are played on Facebook and Instagram daily, and the development of appropriate tools to monetize this content would help Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) expand its margins. The company is also considering the opportunity to monetize its messaging platform, which is currently contributing $9 billion to the top line annually, equivalent to $5 per user.Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We initiated a new position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in the communication services sector, which operates the Facebook and Instagram social media platforms and is a leading digital advertising provider. We have been carefully watching the company over the last few quarters and believe headwinds from lower monetizing in Facebook and Instagram Reels and pressures from consumer privacy measures are poised to lessen. We believe the company has begun to fully acclimate to this new environment, will achieve greater effectiveness in Reels monetization and find ways to adapt to new privacy standards which will rebound advertising efficiency. Combined with a greater focus on cost control, we believe these initiatives will help contribute to further margin expansion and leave the company well-positioned moving forward.”In addition to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Tesla, Inc.

The index has provided a total return of -9.3% YTD (including dividends reinvested), which reflects the worsening health of the US economy in 2022 as the FED continues to raise interest rates. The current year will mark a year of negative performance after three consecutive years of strong positive returns in 2019, 2020, and 2021.The 30 component stocks of the DJIA are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, and they are chosen based on the overall importance of the companies to the economy and the stock market.

We continue to witness strong revenue growth evidenced by achieving revenue of $4.4 million for the third quarter ending September 30, 2022. This represents a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. Notably, our revenue for the nine months ending September 30, 2022, increased 80% over the same period last year, reaching $17.9 million. Our decades of experience, providing an array of multi cloud technology solutions, properly allocated investments, and highly skilled employees are the foundation to our success that has allowed us to firmly position ourselves as a leader within the industry. I'd like to note that we provide solutions to a multi-billion dollar marketplace.In fact, according to Fortune Business Insights, the cloud managed service industry in North America was $16.3 billion in 2019. And has been growing at a rate of 13.8% compounded annual growth rate, bringing the number to $24 billion by the end of 2022. Disaster recovery is projected to be at $3.6 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2022, which represents 35% of the overall 10.3 global marketplace based on Grand View Research Disaster Recovery Solutions Market Size report. Our Nexus Solutions fit well with our dedicated Internet access or critical component to access cloud services. Further, the steadily growing VoIP market is expected to reach 90 billion worldwide in 2022, with a compounded annual growth rate of 3.1% with 17 billion in the U.S. according to GlobeNewswire Market Analysis and Insights.Our goal is to aggressively penetrate these markets while executing on our strategy of securing high margin recurring, subscription based and managed service contracts. As we see more companies migrating their IBM Power infrastructure to the cloud, we believe this propel our solutions to the forefront of the industry, providing us the potential to capitalize on these growing multibillion dollar markets. We see this migration underway as the future of our industry and we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. Given the migration to the Cloud within the IBM market that I've been discussing over the past few conference calls, currently only 15% of the IBM Power service are utilizing the cloud today, despite over 1 million virtual IBM Power service globally.With limited competition in the market, we have the platform and the talent to capture the migration opportunities in front of us. The company has invested millions of dollars in fixed Tier 3 data centers in the U.S. and Canada. The equipment and technical teams build out solutions. This is not an IBM reseller arrangement, we have the employees overseeing the services and operate our own equipment, cages and racks in the data centers. Today, we service over 350 companies. We compete with just four or five companies that have this expertise, helping companies looking to migrate to the cloud. And yet I believe we do a better job less painful, more efficiently and cost competitively. Our company is a leader in this industry. I would also like to reiterate that the businesses that are increasingly under pressure to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the information and storage systems, whereby accelerating the migration from self-managed technical equipment and solutions to fully managed multi cloud technologies to reduce cost and compete effectively.Additionally, in today's environment, capital preservation is an encouragement to move from a capital intensive on-premise technology to a pay as you grow CapEx to OpEx model. These trends create an opportunity for cloud technology service providers, and demand for fully managed cloud and cybersecurity services across major operating systems, an addressable market of approximately $48 billion in annual recurring revenue in the U.S. and Canada. Demonstrating our commitment to security, we achieved ISO certification for our CloudFirst in Nexus Division's. This third party certification validates our extensive internal protocols and security measures that ensure our customers data and information has been addressed, implemented, properly controlled in all areas of our organization.We believe this certification will also assist us in accelerating our customer adoption due to the fact many organizations seek this certification prior to implementing certain solutions. We remain committed to adhering to the highest level of security standards for our company, and for the trusted support of our . Importantly, we are undertaking activities that we anticipate will further improve our margins and profitability, as well as accelerate our growth. This includes realigning management and operations. We have recently centralized service delivery and infrastructure. Our sales engineering teams now can better utilize our client proposal tools and software across combined sales teams. Additionally, we are establishing a new major accounts team that will be responsible for supporting our large enterprise level clients, as well as continuing satisfying ongoing equipment, software and IT requirements.We believe the changes stated will significantly improve our infrastructure solutions and recurring revenue to one time sales ratio, and as a result, will enhance gross profit and margins. At the same time, we plan on expanding our international programs and strengthen our established and successful U.S. sales and marketing programs. To streamline our operations, we are reducing redundant operating expenses within the organizations. We have realigned our management team to further increase our profitability. I'm also pleased to report that we achieved positive adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2022 and believe our initiatives that they have laid out will advance us towards increased profitability and improved margins. On a final note, we have a strong team, a robust proposal pipeline and limited competition.With over $11 million in cash in the bank, we are well funded, well positioned to execute on our growth strategy, improve our margins, increase profitability, all while maintaining leadership position in the industry. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Chris our CFO discuss our third quarter financials. Please go ahead, Chris.See also Edge Computing Market Leaders and 12 Best Solar Energy Stocks To Buy.Chris Panagiotakos: Thank you, Chuck.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Energy Stocks in 2022. Dan Klein, Head of Energy Pathways at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said in a report dated December 12: ""China's COVID policy is the most important fundamental factor for global demand in commodities and energy in 2023 as its demand softness due to lockdowns in 2022 was a key safety valve for oil, gas, and coal markets, while Europe scrambled to replace Russian energy. With another year of vaccinations and growing frustrations with lockdowns domestically in China, restrictions will likely ease somewhat in 2023 and imports of fossil fuels can be expected to increase again.""The S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Energy Outlook 2023 forecasts that China's total energy demand will climb by 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from almost no growth in 2022. This will account for 47% of global energy demand growth in 2023. While China's imports will potentially return to full strength, India has generated solid demand in 2022, with imports of oil and coal significantly larger year-on-year, as it has absorbed meaningful volumes of Russian supply that were previously utilized by Europe.According to S&amp;P Global, commodity prices will normalize in 2023 as fundamentals head towards an equilibrium.  Natural gas, coal, and crude oil prices are all forecasted to be lower in 2023 as compared to 2022 levels. However, 2023 would be beneficial for refiners, and refined products are expected to be traded at high prices. Electricity prices are also set to decline, as renewables come into play and European policymakers cut dependance between natural gas and power prices. Demand for fossil fuels is set to skyrocket in 2023, which would add to the climate crisis given the high carbon dioxide emissions. The geopolitical instability, soft macroeconomic growth, and rampant inflation will continue to rattle the energy security versus energy transition debate. As the global market tries to adapt to the energy crisis with fuel substitution and alternate trade flows, the energy sector will undergo a major transformation worldwide. Story continuesTo play the boom in the energy sector, investors often seek to benefit from the moves of the biggest energy firms (see 17 Biggest Energy Companies in the US) as they spearhead the energy transition movement. While some investors pile into the top energy ETFs (see 10 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022), others look for undervalued equities in the sector (see 12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy). Some of the best performing energy stocks in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. (NYSE:NEX). Our Methodology We selected the following energy stocks based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 27.

However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”7. Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 biggest car companies by sales.The automotive industry is one of the most integral industries in the world and is currently worth around $2.86 trillion. Not only is the industry massive on its own, it is absolutely fundamental to many other industries, including the transportation industry, which itself is indispensable to various industries. As the global economy continues to change, spurred by technological and digital advancements, the automotive industry is perhaps at its biggest crossroads yet.There are four technology driven trends affecting the automotive industry according to McKinsey: autonomous driving, connectivity, electrification and diverse mobility. While vehicles are essential to the economy, there is no denying that typical vehicles which require gas to operate have to become obsolete because of their negative impact on the environment. This is why there is a strong push globally, led by Western economies including Europe and North America, to replace the ""gas guzzlers"" which make up the vast majority of vehicles sold globally. Most major automotive companies have announced their entry into the electric vehicle market, while other companies are entering the EV charging and infrastructure industry, which is expecting massive growth within a relatively short period of time.16 biggest car companies by revenuePhoto by carlos aranda on UnsplashChina, which is the largest producer of vehicles in the world, has launched an initiative to encourage automotive companies to switch to producing electric vehicles. However, this is a lot of controversy regarding how good electric vehicles really are for the environment, even if they do replace fossil fuels as the main source of well, fuel. Electric vehicles need lithium batteries which have to be replaced after several years and cost thousands of dollars. The extraction of lithium is extremely damaging to the environment, which is something that is being glossed over when the switch to electric vehicles is discussed. While greenhouse gases emissions, one of the main contributors to climate change, are reduced and the carbon footprint is lower when using electric vehicles, it will be interesting to see if even better solutions are discovered in the coming years.Story continuesAs mentioned earlier, the automotive industry is at a crossroads, which is why it is hard to predict how it will look like just a decade or fifteen years in the future. Self-driving technology seems to be the next big thing, with many major companies jumping on the chance even though there are several hiccup faced in the industry, especially regarding automated decision making in the event of a potential crash. There have already been fatal crashes involving self-driving vehicles and improvements need to be made in this respect. Meanwhile, shared mobility, feature upgrades, connectivity services and new business models have the potential to add $1.5 trillion to an already massive industry.According to the Economic Intelligence Unit, the immediate future of the automotive industry is not as certain, due to economic headwinds likely to affect this sector as well. The energy crisis, fueled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has affected the automotive sector and global supply-chain disruptions have also had a negative impact in the sector. Because of the latter, vehicle costs are rising, while demand globally is quite high, which has led to astronomical prices for cars, while new cars often have a waiting list of several months. It is uncertain when the disruptions will decrease, and prices will resume to normal. Threats of a recession in a global economy which is slowing down will have further implications for the car industry which has only just recovered from losses thanks to the pandemic.The biggest car companies in the world have a revenue of nearly $2 trillion, with the top two companies alone contributing more than $500 billion in revenue. Some of these companies are the largest in the world, regardless of industry. The revenues for trailing twelve months have been considered with data taken from Yahoo Finance.

On January 18, 2022 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to purchase ATVI for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. The Fund has been invested in ATVI since the second quarter of 2018.The investment thesis was threefold. First, the greater than $200 billion gaming industry is the largest and fastest growing form of entertainment in the world. More than three billion people play games currently and the population of global gamers is expected to grow faster than global population growth this decade.14 Second, ATVI has some of the best intellectual property in the gaming industry including Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. Third, ATVI has had a pristine balance sheet with net cash over the past four years, generated robust free cash flow and traded at an undemanding valuation.ATVI closed the quarter at $80.11—a nearly 16% discount to the acquisition price. Assuming it takes about a year for the deal to close, a 18.6% return seems to be good upside relative to the risk of a deal not closing due to anti -trust concerns. If the transaction closes it would make Microsoft the third-largest company in gaming by revenue behind Tencent and Sony. There is plenty of competition from these larger players as well as smaller competitors such as EA, Take-Two Interactive, Roblox and Epic Games’ Fortnite. The Fund remains invested in ATVI given the significant discount, but should the discount narrow in the coming quarters the Fund could reduce or eliminate the position.”6.

You can skip our industry analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks To Invest In.An autonomous vehicle is one that can drive itself without any human intervention and perform any necessary task through its ability to sense its surroundings. The six levels of automation start from level 0, where a car is entirely dependent on a human driver, up to level 5, where a car does not need human assistance. A car with level 5 automation would be not only able to communicate with other cars but also with traffic lights, signage, and even the roads, to ensure a better and more safe driving experience.The growth of the autonomous vehicle industry is driven by a secular trend toward sustainability and safety. Every year, almost 1 million deaths are recorded due to road tragedies, and about 90% of them are caused by human error. Autonomous vehicles, due to their non-dependency on human assistance, can diminish these issues significantly and reduce accidents due to human error. Moreover, autonomous vehicles can reduce carbon emissions by reducing the time wasted in commuting by 90% and increasing car utilization.Even though 40% of car customers worldwide would be willing to drive fully autonomous cars, there are still some concerns that need to be addressed. Crashes caused by the hacking and hijacking of autonomous vehicles and the leakage of private data being collected by these cars are some of the issues people have raised regarding autonomous cars. Aside from this, the necessary technology for an autonomous vehicle to work completely is still in development, including the availability of reliable and consistent 5G technology.However, given the amount of resources being put into the sector, we can expect the technical issues to be resolved soon in the future. According to Statista, the value of the global autonomous vehicle market in 2021 stood at $27 billion and is expected to grow to $62 billion by 2026. According to Globenewswire, the industry is expected to grow to $125.67 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 22.3%. Many big names in the technology and automobile industry are engaged in developing semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles, with prototypes being tested in their R&amp;D centers. Almost 73% of all cars in the United Kingdom are expected to have some level of autonomy by 2025 before fully autonomous cars enter the market.Story continuesSome of the leading names operating in the autonomous vehicle industry include QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla, Inc.

Conversely, 2022 was a horrendous year for equities, especially the more speculative plays such as meme stocks.To be fair, social media-driven investments that dominated headlines last year were mostly speculative wagers. However, we have seen some of the more familiar names in the stock market dominating the social media chatter. The underlying businesses of these stocks have performed remarkably well despite the challenges posed by the current economic climate. These stocks offer hefty upside potential in what is likely to be a more conducive environment next year for investing.Having said that, the list below includes seven of the top meme stocks to invest in at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceAAPLApple$131.86NFLXNetflix$294.96DISWalt Disney$88.01SOFISoFi Technologies$4.61TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$74.89PYPLPayPal$69.03GMGeneral Motors$33.83Apple (AAPL)Apple logo on a pink and purple background.

The tech giant is known for introducing timeless products to its loyal consumer base, led by the iPhone franchise. This success can be attributed to Apple’s closed-loop ecosystem, which allows them to maintain high gross profit margins while creating lucrative products at premium prices.Despite news of production issues arising from COVID-19 lockdowns in China, Apple’s positioning remains incredible. Moreover, it remains the largest holding in Warren Buffet’s illustrious portfolio. Additionally, with AAPL stock down over 20% from all-time highs, it’s trading at a hefty discount for value investors. Therefore, all signs indicate this is an excellent time to invest in AAPL stock, as investors benefit from the bear market prices.Story continuesNetflix (NFLX)Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on a phone which has a keyboard and red background behind itSource: Pe3k / Shutterstock.comDespite the roadblocks this year, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) remains a heavyweight in the streaming realm.

Moreover, the firm expects 4.5 million new net additions in the upcoming quarter. Recent results have given the company robust stability regarding its subscriber base.

The immediate future of DIS stock is still uncertain, but Iger’s proven track record in delivering long-term success has created a renewed sense of optimism across different industries. With Iger now firmly at the helm, it seems that DIS is poised to reclaim its spot atop the entertainment industry sooner rather than later. It’s clear that Disney has made the courageous decision to stay true to its core values throughout this difficult time, and it looks like luck is finally on its side.The firm’s long-term outlook is incredibly bright on the back of multiple growth catalysts, especially its streaming service in Disney+. The service has grown its subscriber count from 54.5 million in May 2020 to a whopping 164 million in the third quarter of 2022.

To add to the promising developments for the firm, Warren Buffett recently revealed his acquisition of a substantial stake in the stock. This is an invaluable endorsement that solidifies its growth potential and gives its shareholders greater assurance.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a shining example of fintech at its best. The firm delivered robust growth due to the pandemic-led tailwinds but faltered in the current economic climate. However, the ubiquitous payment giant continues to perform well over time and innovate in the sector, which is why it’s often the first company that comes to mind while discussing fintech.Nevertheless, the platform boasts over 300 million users worldwide and is one of the largest automatic payment companies. PayPal has become popular, particularly with eCommerce, which continues to be a major growth catalyst for the foreseeable future.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Altria Group, Inc. (MO) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Meta Platforms have been big-time laggards in 2022, with the stock down -65.4% in the year-to-date period vs. the -40.4% decline in Alphabet shares and the broader market's -21% pullback. Driving Meta's underperformance is the company's aggressive spending plans for metaverse that many in the market see as the wrong strategy. On top of that is the cyclical downturn in the digital advertizing space as a result of macroeconomic factors. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes, normalization of e-commerce after the pandemic peak and higher inflation are some of the other headwinds.User base in Europe declined in the last reported quarter, with the fourth-quarter guidance reflecting macroeconomic and forex concerns. Weak advertising demand is a headwind. Meta expects Reels to monetize much slower than feed or stories. Shares have underperformed the industry in the past year.However, Meta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Altria Group have underperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (-1.9% vs. +4.0%), but have held up really well relative to the broader market. The company's revenues in the last reported quarter were hurt by the wine unit’s divestiture and soft shipment volumes in the Smokeable Products unit due to retail share losses and the industry’s rate of decline.However, Altria Group has been gaining from its strong pricing power, which aided the bottom-line growth in the third quarter of 2022. Also, management remains optimistic about its journey toward a smoke-free future.To this end, the company’s investment in on! is yielding well. The reported shipment volumes of on! surged roughly 70% in the third quarter.

Per our estimate, the segment is likely to witness a year-over-year fall of 47.6% in fiscal 2022. Further, mounting expenses and rising competition pose a risk to the company’s market position.Nevertheless, Applied Materials is benefiting from strong momentum across Semiconductor Systems and Applied Global Services. Further, solid demand for silicon in several applications across various markets remains a tailwind.Increased customer spending in foundry and logic on the back of rising need for specialty nodes in automotive, power, 5G rollout, IoT, communications and image sensor markets, is a major positive.

Multiple flights across the United States have been cancelled by airline companies due to a severe winter storm during the Christmas holiday weekend.Reportedly, LUV cancelled 62% of its flights on Dec 27. This unprecedented disruption in operations resulted in the LUV stock shedding 5.96% of its value on Dec 27.What is worse is that LUV’s rivals have seen their operations being disrupted at a much lower scale. Other airline majors like Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL cancelled not more than 2% of their flights on Dec 27.We note that LUV is the biggest carrier serving Buffalo, NY, the hardest-hit urban area by this natural catastrophe. Management has apologized to passengers for the harassments they had to face due to disruption in operations.The disruption is likely to hit LUV’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance. Detailed results will be out on Jan 26, 2023.Southwest Airlines’ massive rate of flight cancellations did not go unnoticed. Rather it attracted the attention of the Biden administration. The U.S. Department of Transportation has termed LUV’s flight-cancellation rate as “unacceptable.”The Department of Transportation intends to investigate whether the cancellations could have been controlled.

(NYSE:PNC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$156). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in PNC Financial Services Group than they bought, over the last year.

In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes PNC Financial Services Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$214m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, PNC Financial Services Group makes money, and is growing profits.

195,efb04db9-d1c5-3ed3-a1a7-feb0f6c64d01,PNW,2022-12-29,3 Utilities With Stable Income Streams to Help You Retire Early,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-utilities-stable-income-streams-142202500.html,1672237322,STORY,"['ETR', 'ELP', 'PNW']","[The year 2022 was marked by order and chaos at the same time in the U.S. utility space. While the recovery in economic activities induced by an improving COVID situation worldwide boosted industrial electric sales, extreme climate conditions, ranging from severe drought to hurricanes, had an adverse impact on the overall performance of the Utilities sector.However, this does not mean one should worry about investment opportunities in Utilities stocks. After all, Utilities is one of the few sectors wherein demand never dies out, even during turbulent economic conditions. And this steady demand scenario supports utilities in providing a stable dividend to investors.As we head toward 2023, investors who desire a steady stream of income can choose stocks from the defensive, matured, regulated and domestic-focused utility space to avoid huge losses in times of crisis. Here, we have presented three utility stocks, Companhia Paranaense de Energia ELP, Entergy ETR and Pinnacle West Capital PNW, which are expected to gain substantially in 2023, capitalizing on their fundamental strength.Factors Boosting Utilities’ ProspectsThe rapidly expanding renewable energy space is perhaps the largest growth catalyst currently boosting the U.S. utility sector. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration (EIA) forecast that the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 20% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 and 24% in 2023, driven by the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity.EIA further expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 38 GW and 54 GW in 2022 and 2023, respectively. With the entire utility space focused on the transition to a greener environment, the aforementioned projections are indicative of the ample growth opportunities that utilities offer.Another factor driving growth in the utility space is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which aims at investing nearly $3 billion in the U.S. transmission system. This, in turn, should bolster grid resiliency, thereby boosting utility customers’ confidence in this industry.Story continuesOur ChoicesConsidering the aforementioned discussion, selecting a utility stock is a prudent step. With the help of the Zacks Stocks Screener, we have narrowed our search to the following three stocks based on a favorable Zacks Rank and other fundamental metrics. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Companhia Paranaense de Energia: Based in Brazil, Copel Companhia Paranaense de Energia is involved in the generation, distribution and transmission of electricity. In November 2022, the company announced the acquisition of two more wind hubs worth BRL 1.8 billion enterprise value, which will add more than 260 megawatts of installed capacity to its portfolio. This should enhance the company’s position in the clean-energy-driven utility space.ELP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its 2023 earnings growth rate is pegged at 134.6%. Moreover, the stock boasts an annual dividend yield of 9.27%. The stock has rallied 22.6% year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEntergy: Based in New Orleans, LA, Entergy is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. Entergy is developing its capital investment plan for 2023 through 2025 and currently anticipates that the utility will make approximately $15.5 billion in capital investments during that period. Such investments would further strengthen the grid’s resiliency.ETR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its 2023 sales and earnings growth rates are pegged at 9% and 6.3%, respectively. Moreover, the stock boasts an annual dividend yield of 3.77%. The stock has rallied 1.8% year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPinnacle West: Based in Phoenix, AZ, Pinnacle West Capital is involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity from coal, nuclear, gas, oil and solar. To efficiently serve its expanding customer base, the company plans to invest $4.7 billion during the 2022-2024 period.PNW currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its 2023 sales growth rate is pegged at 5.7%. Moreover, the stock boasts an annual dividend yield of 4.44%.

But I think everyone sort of knows that. I mean, one of the issues that Best Buy is dealing with, aside from the macroeconomic headwinds, is the fact that you did have this very significant demand pull forward in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic,"" Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).Indeed, most signs point to a lackluster fourth quarter from the electronics retailer.November retail sales disappointed the market, with pressure seen in big-ticket categories such as electronics.Separate data this week, from Mastercard's SpendingPulse report, found that sales of electronics fell 5.3% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24. The category saw the second-worst sales performance this holiday season, just behind a 5.4% drop for jewelry.“Inflation altered the way U.S. consumers approached their holiday shopping – from hunting for the best deals to making trade-offs that stretched gift-giving budgets,” Mastercard North America chief economist Michelle Meyer said.Best Buy itself entered the holidays with minimal sales momentum, at best.Same-store sales fell in almost all lines of the business in the third quarter. Profit margins tanked in both Best Buy's domestic and international segments. U.S. and international same-store sales fell 10.5% and 9.3%, respectively, in the third quarter.Shares of Best Buy are down 21% year to date.While Chukumba is cautious on Best Buy's near-term results, the question is whether all recent related bad news is priced into the stock. The long-time retail watcher thinks Best Buy's stock valuation has perhaps reached a trough.""Now, here's the good news in terms of Best Buy shareholders. That's [a bad fourth quarter] more than priced into the stock, particularly at current valuation levels. So I don't think that Best Buy having a tough holiday selling season is going to be a big surprise to anyone,"" Chukumba said.Story continuesA shopper pushes a cart with a TV in front of a Best Buy store during Black Friday sales in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 25, 2022.

(Photo by Carl D. Walsh/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)To be sure, not many on Wall Street would be shocked if the 2022 holiday season were to be Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's last.The retailer has battled all year long with tanking sales, weak store traffic, low cash levels, and merchandise not aligned with customer tastes. Earlier this year, the board ousted Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's turnaround CEO Mark Tritton. Other execs have also fled as cash-saving, cost-cutting efforts are underway.Furthermore, new CEO Sue Gove hasn't been able to revive the company, which has been heavily discounting products this holiday season in an effort to raise badly needed cash.Comparable store sales crashed 26% from a year prior in the fiscal second quarter as the economic slowdown and poor inventory quality weighed on store traffic. The challenged top line and increased discounting led to the company posting an operating loss of $168 million in the quarter.Not helping sentiment is that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond may have had a very ugly holiday shopping season as it continues to battle execution issues and more cautious shoppers.U.S. web traffic for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond dropped a startling 19% in November, according to new research from Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski. The declines worsened from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday with a drop of about 25% versus the prior year.Story continuesMeanwhile, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock has plunged 83% in 2022, badly underperforming the S&amp;P 500's 20% drop.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Still, Target had purchase restrictions on baby formula products both at its stores and online.However, Reckitt in early December said it expects the U.S. infant formula shortage to ""persist"" until spring. It is the maker of what is now the biggest brand in the market, Enfamil.According to data firm IRI, in-stock rates at U.S. stores have continued to improve and are close to pre-recall levels at 86% now compared with 88%–90% before the recall.

(NYSE:SAM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Deutsche Bank turned bearish on The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) on Tuesday, December 6. The research firm downgraded the high-end alcoholic beverage company from “Hold” to “Sell,” citing weakness in its core hard seltzer segment.Analyst Steve Powers pointed towards dropping seltzer sales amid intensifying competition and increasing pressure on consumer spending. Powers expects Truly sales to drop in the low single digits next year due to these factors. In addition, the analyst expects rising costs to weigh on the profitability of The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM).Separately, investment management firm Artisan Partners also discussed Boston Beer’s hard seltzer business in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said about The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM):Story continues“We ended our campaigns in Boston Beer Company. Boston Beer Company sells a focused portfolio of alcoholic beverage brands. In recent years, the company has emerged as one of the leaders in the hard seltzer category, which has grown over 150% in each of the past three years (2018-2020). Boston Beer’s Truly brand, the second-largest seller of hard seltzer, has benefited from this growth and was core to our investment thesis. However, the hard seltzer category’s growth has recently slowed to single digits, falling short of high investor expectations and pressuring Boston Beer’s earnings upside. Truly’s growth was core to our investment thesis, and a recovery is uncertain; thus, we ended our investment campaign.”9. Tripadvisor, Inc.

However, sales seem to be bouncing back, as data from Mastercard SpendingPulse shows that the retail sector has been witnessing impressive sales during the December holiday period.This, at the same time, proves that people are still willing to spend despite high commodity prices. Also, higher sales during the holiday season indicate a good start for the retail sector in 2023. Given this scenario, stocks with a strong online presence, like Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Citi Trends, Inc. CTRN, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST and Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS and are expected to benefit in the near term.Holiday Season Retail Sales UpU.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, have jumped a solid 7.6% on a year-over-year basis this holiday season, between Nov 1 through Dec 24, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report. The jump comes despite multi-year high inflation and growing recession fears.E-commerce once again has been playing a major role in driving sales. Online sales jumped 10.6% year over year. E-commerce made up 21.6% of the overall retail sales during this period. In 2021, e-commerce made up 20.9% of the total retail sales, while 20.6% of sales were online in 2020.Needless to say, people are increasingly relying on e-commerce, a trend that gathered steam during the peak of the pandemic.Weekends were the best for sales. Black Friday recorded the top spending day of the holiday season so far, with a 12% year-over-year rise in sales, excluding automotive.Additionally, sales at restaurants increased 15.1% year over year as Americans relaxed their pandemic quarantines and sought out in-person experiences.The report follows weak retail sales recorded in November.

206,ea3235fa-bc77-3431-b19b-d66bbd7514e5,ADI,2022-12-29,"Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 88% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110029775.html,1672311629,STORY,['ADI'],"[Every investor in Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 88% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Analog Devices, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Analog Devices does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Analog Devices. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Analog Devices, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$276m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Analog Devices , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2022.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that represents the performance of 30 large, publicly traded companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and most widely followed stock market indices in the world. It was first published in 1896 and has since become a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market. The index is calculated based on the stock prices of the 30 companies that make up the index, with each company's weight in the index determined by its market capitalization (the total value of its outstanding shares).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is often used as a barometer of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. The index has provided a total return of -9.3% YTD (including dividends reinvested), which reflects the worsening health of the US economy in 2022 as the FED continues to raise interest rates. The current year will mark a year of negative performance after three consecutive years of strong positive returns in 2019, 2020, and 2021.The 30 component stocks of the DJIA are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, and they are chosen based on the overall importance of the companies to the economy and the stock market. The index is reconstituted often as new companies are added while the older ones get replaced. The most recent reconstitution in the index occurred in 2020 when companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) were added to the index, while Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) were removed. Interestingly, the companies removed from the index were amongst the top-performing firms in 2022, with Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) providing a total return of 84.60%, 18.08% and -9.39% respectively, outperforming the broader market. Whereas newly added provided mixed returns in 2022 with Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) providing a total return YTD return of 21.01%, -49.07%, and 4.67% respectively.Story continuesThe DJIA has outperformed other market indices like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq in 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has provided a YTD total return of -9.3% compared with -34.4% provided by the Nasdaq and -18.0% provided by the S&amp;P 500. The Defensive sector which comprises 29.49% of the total weightage of the Dow, may be a reason why the index performed better than others in the current year.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Visa (V).Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.27, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.27 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 81.8% and 9.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Visa, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in V?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.1% over the past month to $8.28.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Visa. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Visa with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The copper-rich country's currency jumped as much as 2.6% at 844.9 per dollar, last up 0.6% in afternoon trading. It touched its strongest level since Sept. 5. News that Chile's central bank would extend its forward dollar sales operations program to June from a previously announced end date of January boosted the currency in the previous session. Brightening the mood further on Wednesday, copper prices hit two-week peaks as top consumer China's easing of COVID restrictions spurred buying of the metal despite a rise in infection there. The Brazilian real gained 0.6% and the Mexican peso held ground against the dollar even as data showed Brazil created fewer formal jobs than expected in November, while another set showed Mexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate eased to 3% in November from 3.2% in the previous month. Most stock markets in the region also rose, with Brazil's Bovespa touching a three-week high with miner Vale and banks among the top performers. The MSCI's index for Latin American stocks is up 1.4% in 2022. In contrast, the MSCI'S broader gauge for emerging market stocks has fallen more than 22% for the year, heading for its worst performance since 2008. ""Persistent above-trend inflation has prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy leading to a bear market (falls of greater than 20%),"" said Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo, also pointing to weakness in China. On the day, Brazil's Petroreconcavo SA climbed 5.7% after the oil company agreed to buy Maha Energy's local subsidiary, in another step in its ongoing expansion.

Meanwhile, Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose term ends in September 2024, said the country will cut the cost of servicing external debt by half for the start of the next administration.

Workers demanded better safety conditions, higher wages, and more environmental regulation.A month-long state of emergency has been declared in Peru after supporters of Pedro Castillo—the imprisoned former president—blocked roads, closed airports, and ratcheted up pressure on the country’s new government. The extraordinary decision announced by defense minister Alberto Otárola suspended several civil liberties, including the right to assembly and freedom of transit.Castillo’s supporters took to the streets in protest immediately after his former vice president Dina Boluarte was sworn in as his successor in early December. The protestors claim that the country’s political and financial elite never gave Castillo, Peru’s first indigenous president and a political outsider, a chance to successfully govern, and that the national congress acted unlawfully in removing Castillo from power.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureThe protests are supported by the country’s largest association of indigenous groups and the national federation of labor unions, a base reflective of the coalition that originally propelled Castillo into office.Born to illiterate farmers in a rural, impoverished community, Castillo ran for president on the slogan “no more poor people in a rich country,” vowing to redistribute the profits of international mining companies and other foreign companies operating in Peru to the country’s poor.The fifth president in just four years, Boluarte must find a way to rally support and stabilize the country’s political institutions. As she considers calling for new elections in 2023, a recent Ipsos poll had her approval rating at just 21%, six percentage points lower than the final poll of Castillo’s term.The rural/urban divideCastillo is just the second Peruvian president since 1956 born outside of Lima, the wealthy capital city. Much of his political support is found in the country’s rural areas. In the first round of the election, he won just 18% of the national vote, but received more than 50% of the vote in Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Hiancavelicia. These three southern regions are home to some of the largest copper and gold deposits in the world, yet remain the poorest in Peru.Story continuesDuring his presidential campaign, Castillo openly attacked foreign mining companies, promising environmental regulations, higher taxes, and wealth redistribution. After he was elected, foreign mining companies experienced months-long strikes and road blockades that paralyzed production and prompted deadly clashes between protestors and police.Notably, the major Chinese mining company MMG was forced to declare force majure after protestors shut down all operations at the Las Bambas mine, responsible for 2% of the world’s copper production. In response to these extended labor actions, foreign investors fled and the credit rating agency Moody’s downgraded Peru from an A3 rating to Baa1, the country’s lowest since 2011, warning of weakened policymaking capacity and a “fractured political environment.”Castillo was removed from office in December for attempting to form a provisional government and draft a new constitution. Within the day, he was impeached and detained on charges of treason.Now, with tensions only heightened since his removal, the new administration must balance the country’s needs for economic growth and political stability while trying to appease Castillo’s newly-energized supporters.Mining in the Peruvian Andes, by the numbers:60%: Mining’s percentage of Peru’s total exports.$53 billion: Estimate of lost profits for foreign mining companies because of strikes and other work stoppages during the summer of 2022.25%: The percentage of Peruvians currently living in poverty.51%: The proportion of Peruvians suffering from food insecurity.$3.67: Average hourly wage for a worker in a Peruvian mine.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -9.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 11.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.4%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.37 indicates a change of +33.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.3%. The $26.94 billion and $29.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +9.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These GPUs were designed to challenge AMD's Radeon and Nvidia's GeForce in the high-end PC gaming market. Also, these GPUs are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and are built using a 7nm process.According to recent industry benchmarks, Intel's Arc A380 GPU has proven to deliver better performance than AMD's Radeon RX 6400 across a wide range of games.This is significant because the RX 6400 is more expensive than the A380, which retails for around $140, while Nvidia's comparable GTX 1630 costs about $200. Hence, this may make the A380 an attractive option for consumers looking for good performance at a lower price point.Intel's market share of discrete GPUs has increased, which is concerning as the overall GPU market has declined 42% year on year to 14 million units in third-quarter 2022. This is due to a shrinking PC market, and Intel, AMD, and Nvidia are all competing for a decreasing market.Intel designs and manufactures computer chips and other electronic components. Its products are used in a wide range of devices, including personal computers, servers and mobile devices.For 2022, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be $63-$64 billion, down from prior expectations of $65-$68 billion, owing to challenging macroeconomic conditions with high uncertainty. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.95 per share, down from prior expectations of $2.30.Story continuesAt present, INTC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

233,9063eb32-7dd8-389a-b39a-667d25b7d3b2,DIS,2022-12-29,Is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-company-nyse-dis-110012294.html,1672311612,STORY,['DIS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$108 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$84.17. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$84.17 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney What Is Walt Disney Worth?Walt Disney appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 48.07x is currently well-above the industry average of 25.05x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Walt Disney’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Walt Disney generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in DIS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe DIS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for DIS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

A few fights between visitors inside the park have gone viral recently. (Javier Tommy Calle / Los Angeles Times)The ""Happiest Place on Earth"" is reminding visitors to ""treat others with respect"" after a few violent confrontations took place at the Anaheim resort.The reminder came in the form of a new ""courtesy"" section to the Disneyland website, which was added days after a similar notice appeared on the website for the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.The new section was added to the Southern California resort's website as one of the ""Top Things You Should Know"" before visiting the park, including reminders to make park reservations, updates on face mask requirements, and using the park's app for parkgoers to plan their visit.""We ask all who come to this happy place to treat others with respect, kindness and compassion,"" the notice reads. The section links to the park's rules.The new section is similar to the one officials added to the Walt Disney World Resort, which asks visitors to ""Be the magic you want to see in the world.""""You must always remember to treat others with respect, kindness and compassion,"" the Disney World notice reads. ""Those who can't live up to this simple wish may be asked to leave Walt Disney World Resort.""KTLA reported the Disney World notice was added in mid-December, while the Disneyland update was added during the holiday season.A spokesperson for Disneyland did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The new notices come after a few confrontations inside the park have been recorded and gone viral online. The videos on social media have at times pierced through the carefully crafted image of the resort, showing fights and ugly confrontations inside.In July 2019, a violent brawl between relatives at Mickey’s Toontown in Disneyland was captured on video, showing parents scurrying children past the fight as fists flew.In May, another video posted on Twitter showed park security trying to pull several people apart who had begun to brawl before the beginning of park's Fantasmic! fireworks and water show.Disneyland is not the only park to struggle with unruly crowds. In July, Knott's Berry Farm instituted a new policy requiring chaperones for all underage visitors on Fridays and Saturdays. The decision came after a series of fights between teens broke out at the park, forcing officials to close early.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

(AMC, of course, is in a slightly different bucket due to its prominent role in the meme stock collapse.)Still, there is hope among analysts that next year's more beefed-up release schedule will help close the gap after COVID-induced production delays pushed a significant number of titles into the new year.""The lesson learned is if you build it, they will come,"" Comscore senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Yahoo Finance Live, noting there were around 40 fewer wide releases in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic times. ""When the movies were out there in the summer, we saw the box office explode. But there weren't as many films in the post-summer period.""Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, added: ""Theaters need more films. That's really the bottom line...I look at 2023 on the whole as an improvement over 2022.""Robbins said more mid-range films, or movies that perform in the $50 million to $175 million range, coupled with more family-friendly content, will help buoy ticket sales with more than 100 wide-release films set for next year.He said sequels like ""Fast X,"" ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods,"" ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,"" ""Dune: Part Two"" ""Creed III,"" ""John Wick: Chapter 4,"" and the ""Hunger Games"" prequel will all likely land in the upper end of those ranges, possibly higher.Story continuesFamily titles he's watching include ""Trolls 3,"" ""Wanka,"" ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" ""Elemental,"" and Disney's live-action ""Little Mermaid.""""It's hard to say that we'll have another movie as big as 'Top Gun Maverick,' but the flip side of that coin is I think we'll have more films that perform in that $200 million to $400 million range,"" he said.Top Gun takes top billing""Top Gun: Maverick"" shattered a 15-year record after it debuted to much fanfare over the Memorial Day Weekend holiday. The Tom Cruise-led sequel was highest grossing film of the year, securing $1.5 billion globally.The film went on to become the number one digital release of all time on OTT streaming platforms before officially debuting on Paramount+ on December 22.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.But not every film released in 2022 has been an immediate box office success story.Disney's (DIS) ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" secured just $134 million in domestic markets over its three-day opening weekend, missing expectations and sending Disney shares to their lowest level since March 2020.Despite the miss, the film recovered nicely in its second weekend over the long Christmas holiday before it officially crossed $1 billion in global tickets 12 days after its debut — the fastest movie of the year to soar past the highly-regarded industry benchmark. ""Top Gun Maverick"" and ""Jurassic World: Dominon"" were the only other films to cross that $1 billion milestone this year.""My biggest cautionary tale with this movie has been to play the long game,"" Robbins said. ""There's always an immediate urge to qualify a movie's opening weekend. In a lot of cases, that's possible, especially with front-loaded franchises like Marvel or Star Wars. James Cameron's films have never been that way.""""Avatar: The Way of Water"" secures $1 billion in global box office ticket sales (Courtesy: Disney)The analyst noted the film has faced added complexities due to the strong preference to see it in premium formats, like IMAX, which have a limited theatrical supply compared to the overwhelming demand.IMAX announced on Tuesday the sequel had earned $105.5 million in IMAX global box office in less than two weeks — the fastest film to hit the $100 million mark in IMAX since April 2019 (and only the ninth film to reach that milestone in its history).""'Avatar: The Way of Water' is showing the strong endurance at the global box office we expected, particularly with its phenomenal performance internationally where several key markets grew their grosses over opening weekend,"" IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond said in a press release.The film, largely expected to benefit from a rare China release, has faced recent challenges as China's box office slows amid a severe spike in COVID-19 cases. Still, according to IMAX, the company pulled in $26.5 million in China box office receipts, representing about 25.5% of total grosses in the country on 1% of screens.Will more streamers embrace theatrical? Streaming companies have slowly begun to embrace the theatrical window, with high-powered Hollywood executives arguing that the box office has become an essential stop for films looking to turn a profit.""The debate is over,"" IMAX's Gelfond previously told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The argument that you can skip a theatrical window and make up for it on streaming just isn't true. The theatrical window is more essential than ever to get the streaming revenue.""Gelfond referenced deep streaming losses from the likes of Disney, which saw its direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on October 1, while other media giants like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global (PARA) have also struggled with profitability.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Netflix (NFLX), which has been largely resistant to a box office partnership, released ""Knives Out: Glass Onion"" in select theaters over Thanksgiving week as co-CEO Reed Hastings admitted the streaming giant left ""lots"" of money on the table after it refused to commit to a wider release.""It’s a promotional tactic like film festivals, and if it works well we will do more of it,"" Hastings said at the New York Times Dealbook Summit last month. ""We are not trying to build a theatrical business, we are trying to break through the noise.""According to industry estimates, the film secured about $13 million in domestic markets — despite only playing for one week in some 600 theaters. To compare, a typical blockbuster plays in roughly 3,500 theaters for at least 45 days.Box Office Pro's Robbins suggested the theatrical success of ""Glass Onion"" points to a ""watershed moment for the relationship between Netflix and all streamers and exhibitors.""""If anything is going to move the needle, it's going to start here with this movie,"" he added.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, however, downplayed the decision, telling investors on the company's third quarter earnings call: ""We are in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix, so that’s where we focus all our energy and most of our spend.""The streaming giant revealed the sequel was streamed 82.1 million hours in the first three days since its December 23 release. That doesn't even crack Netflix's top five film debuts — falling behind titles like ""The Unforgivable"" (85.86 million hours), ""The Gray Man"" (88.55 million hours), ""The Adam Project"" (92.43 million hours), ""Don’t Look Up"" (111.03 million hours), and ""Red Notice"" (148.72 million hours)Netflix released 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery' in select theaters for one week over Thanksgiving (Courtesy: Netflix)Tech behemoth Amazon (AMZN), which closed its $8.5 billion deal to acquire MGM earlier this year, will also sharpen its focus on theatrical releases, reportedly investing $1 billion to produce 12 to 15 movies a year exclusively for theaters.""Much will come down to what kind of content Amazon produces, how long their windows will be, and how heavily it may lean on IP versus original material, but this is still resoundingly good news for theater owners and Hollywood,"" Robbins said at the time of the announcement.""Now that streaming has begun to mature, the pendulum is certainly swinging back toward a balance as these distributors see the kind of success they've been leaving on the table with an all-in approach to streaming,"" Robbins said. ""Theatrical remains a very lucrative business model, and [Amazon's] news underscores that yet again.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt.

My administration will continue to take action to ease the financial burden on New Yorkers who have felt the impact of this tragic storm,” Gov. Hochul said in the announcement.M&amp;T Bank announced on Dec. 28 that, due to the impact of the storm, it would waive ATM fees in Western New York.“Through January 10, 2023, M&amp;T is waiving fees for anyone who uses M&amp;T Bank ATMs in Niagara, Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Wyoming, Genesee, Orleans, Monroe counties,” M&amp;T Bank tweeted. “M&amp;T won’t charge our customers in Western New York for using a non-M&amp;T Bank ATM.  Please note that other banks may charge you a fee.”The governor’s office also warned customers about price gouging and asked them to report such instances, which occur “when a business takes advantage of consumers during an emergency declaration and sells essential goods or services in the affected area for an excessive price,” according to the announcement.Story continuesExamples of such behavior include hotels hiking their prices during a crisis, or hardware stores increasing prices on necessary supplies such as bags of sand.To report such practices, consumers can file a complaint with the New York State Division of Consumer Protection on the Department of State website — or call the consumer helpline at 1-800-697-1220.“It is unconscionable, not to mention illegal, for businesses to take advantage of their customers with price gouging after they’ve been hit with a devastating winter storm and desperately trying to recover,” New York Secretary of State Robert J. Rodriguez said in an announcement. “Consumers do not have to do this on their own which is why the Division of Consumer Protection is urging consumers to file a complaint so together we can fight this illegal activity.”On Dec. 23, New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued an alert reminding consumers and businesses across the state that price gouging during — and in the aftermath of — the storm is illegal.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?More: 7 Surprising Challenges of Renting in New YorkIn addition, the AG’s office reminded consumers to protect themselves when hiring contractors to perform storm-related services.Some of those tips include: shopping around by getting at least three estimates from reputable contractors; getting a detailed contract in writing; never paying the full price up front; checking with the Better Business Bureau, banks and suppliers for references; and knowing your rights.More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20236 Most Effective Ways to Build Your Credit ScoreThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: New York Waives Bank Fees and Warns of Price Gouging Amid Disastrous Winter Storm — What To Look Out For]"

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA.Industry: ApparelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2032969/5-textile-apparel-stocks-worth-a-watch-despite-rising-inflationPlayers in the Zacks Textile – Apparel industry continue to battle inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions. Rising selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, mainly due to higher freight and logistic costs, continue to hurt several companies in the space.That said, growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses coupled with effective brand enhancement techniques keep Lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corporation, Columbia Sportswear Company, PVH Corp. and Under Armour, Inc. well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal in fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.Story continuesInternational Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

244,d4c1909f-4143-3cd1-abdb-f8c5cb5e6caa,UA,2022-12-29,Under Armour’s strategy ‘will not change that much’ with new CEO: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/under-armour-strategy-not-change-170250247.html,1672246970,VIDEO,"['UA', 'UAA']","[Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the task ahead for Under Armour’s new CEO, the categories the athletic apparel company plays in, inventory issues, and opportunities to take market share.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Let's get under the hood of Under Armour now. Shares in the retailer down over 50% since the start of the year, as it deals with a variety of headwinds from an inventory glut, fierce competition from Nike and Adidas and Lululemon, and a costly courtroom battle with the UCLA.The bright spot for the coming year might well be incoming CEO Stephanie Linnartz, who's currently president over at Marriott. Though athletic apparel certainly fresh terrain for the new boss, her focus said to be boosting the group's digital offering. Joining us to discuss is David Schwartz, equity analyst at Morningstar. David, good to see you here. What are the top three moves you want to see from Stephanie coming out of the gate here?DAVID SWARTZ: I think there's a lot of focus on the digital strategy and on a loyalty program, getting more people to download Under Armour's apps and getting more connected to the consumer. I think there's also a focus on inventory levels and the supply chain, which has been a work in progress for Under Armour for the last few years. I think that's another high top priority.And then another one would really be the product and increasing distribution. Under Armour is strong in some areas. They're weaker in other areas like footwear. There is a lot of opportunity, I think, for Under Armour to increase its distribution to retailers like Foot Locker, which have lost some Nike product and that may present an opening for Under Armour's footwear.JULIE HYMAN: David, though, is CEO of Under Armour sort of, for lack of a better word, a doomed position, given the dominance of Kevin Plank, of course, the founder and chairman at the company? Is it really going to be a tough job for, really, anyone who would have stepped into that role?Story continuesDAVID SWARTZ: It is problematic, yes, because Kevin Plank is still the controlling shareholder. He's still very influential with the company. And the way that Patrick Frisk was dismissed earlier this year doesn't exactly bode well for an outsider CEO coming into Under Armour.But one of the benefits that the new CEO seems to have is that she worked with the Marriott family at Marriott, so she does have experience in working with a controlling family, and that could help at Under Armour. I don't think that she'll be able to change the strategy very much. Under Armour has really been in restructuring mode for about five or six years. And that's really not going to change that much under a new CEO.BRAD SMITH: Is the sentiment around Under Armour from a consumer perspective waning, remaining strong? What can they do to really prop up or engage that next wave of consumers, as even across lifestyle and performance, there seems to be even within the existing categorical players in athletic apparel and footwear, there seems to be a strategic approach that a lot of the competitors have to both of those categories, whereas Under Armour has largely been just in the performance category?DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah, that's true. So Under Armour, for many years, has resisted complaints from the analysts and shareholders that it should really be getting more into athleisure and more casual sportswear. Now for a long time, Under Armour resisted that and said they would strictly focus on performance sportswear. Now recently, however, they have suggested they're going to release more casual product. And that will be something for the new CEO to handle.But Under Armour does face a lot of competition there. There are so many strong athleisure companies like Lululemon and others that you've mentioned. And they really have a better market position right now than Under Armour does. So it's going to be a long time, really, before Under Armour becomes a major player in that area. I think Under Armour does have a strong customer base among youth, high school athletes, college athletes. That's really the strength of the company, is the teenager and college age market.BRIAN SOZZI: And David, from what I can tell, the only line, apparel line inside of Under Armour that seems to be selling well consistently is anything made by the Rock. And I think the argument could be made that they have not utilized his brand pretty much at all. The products are constantly out of stock. Does Stephanie to reach out to him, and maybe they need to be doing more with someone like that?DAVID SWARTZ: Under Armour has had trouble managing its inventory over the years. They've had trouble with their supply chain. So yeah, there have been times when they've been sold out of things. Under Armour has a large wholesale operation, so they don't have necessarily great control over their product as much as Nike does, which has a much larger direct-to-consumer business, for example.So it makes it tough for Under Armour because they're dependent on orders from wholesale partners. And a lot of their own sales are really through discount channels through outlet stores. Under Armour does not have a lot of great full price retail sales of its own. And that's one thing that Under Armour will need to work on. And it doesn't have the partnerships. You mentioned the Rock, but it doesn't have the partnerships that Nike and Adidas have. And that's one of its problems.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and so within that digital strategy that you would put in your top three things that they need to work on, or at least that the new CEO needs to prioritize, how do you really prop up that digital strategy or drive some of the demand digitally when you don't have those other things that your competitors do?DAVID SWARTZ: I think Under Armour does need to upgrade its product, offer a more diverse product line, more than just focus on, like, college football, which is sort of Under Armour's best known category. They're known for high school and college football. They need to diversify a little bit, try to get more into the collector market, maybe sign some new athletes. Under Armour's marketing strategy really has changed more than once over the last few years. So it's not really clear what it is all the time.I mean, that's something that Under Armour really needs to nail down. But I do think that the company has fans. It's still a company with $6 billion in sales. They have opportunities outside of the US, especially in China, which is expected to be the largest sportswear market, certainly the fastest growing one. And Under Armour really needs to improve its international focus, too. It's not just the US consumer.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I would have expected to see some limited edition colorways of Steph Curry's old shoes, the best selling ones at least, and some of the utilization of the other athletes that they've been very popular with and have courted in the past. David, a pleasure to have this conversation with you. We're all going to see how they perform in 2023. David Swartz, equity analyst over at Morningstar, we appreciate it.]"

Rising selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, mainly due to higher freight and logistic costs, continue to hurt several companies in the space.That said, growth initiatives to enhance offline and online businesses coupled with effective brand enhancement techniques keep Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Columbia Sportswear Company COLM, PVH Corp. PVH and Under Armour, Inc. UAA well placed for growth.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running, and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal in fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryCost Concerns: A rise in input costs persistently weighs on the profits of several textile-apparel companies. Players in this space continue to battle supply-chain-related issues stemming from prolonged COVID-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. The ongoing supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. The recent winter storms across the United States are adding to the supply chain woes. Additionally, textile-apparel players continue to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations, especially during the holiday season, are likely to further push SG&amp;A costs upwards. The impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses is also a major concern for the payers. In fact, financial constraints are compelling customers to be more selective in their purchases, impacting sales of apparel companies this holiday season. Also, a challenging and competitive labor market is a concern. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins.International Exposure Poses Risks: Owing to its international presence, Textile-apparel companies are exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Political unrest, like turmoil related to current geopolitical events and the related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could dent companies’ performance. Several players are facing the impacts of the Ukraine war, including supply-chain and regulatory hurdles.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies in the space are witnessing a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales driven by an increase in traffic as consumers return to stores for shopping. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. The companies in the space have been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations, and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players. Return to social gatherings and growing wardrobe needs has been prompting shoppers to buy certain styles this holiday season.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts, and alliances are likely to keep supporting Textile-apparel players. New product launches are an important part of Textile-apparel players’ growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. The pandemic pushed the comfortable leisurewear category, which has been working in favor of activewear providers.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Being one of the largest producers in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Hess is well-positioned to capitalize on the improvement in the crude price.Hess made multiple oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. The company’s two latest discoveries at the Seabob-1 and Kiru-Kiru-1 wells will add to the block’s recoverable resource estimate. Hess expects the production to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2027.Hess made a final investment decision for the Yellowtail development offshore Guyana. Commencing 2025, the project will develop an estimated resource of more than 900 million oil barrels. Hence, the company’s cash flow situation is expected to make a major jump, which will enable it to increase shareholder returns.For 2022, Hess has revised its net production guidance (excluding Libya) upward to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) from the prior stated 320,000 Boe/d. For the fourth quarter, net production (excluding Libya) is projected to be 370,000 Boe/d. Coupled with higher oil prices, increased production will boost the company’s bottom line.Numerous factors are aiding the stock price surge for HES and are creating more room for upside. Hess is expecting significant free cash flow growth in the coming years, which will get allocated toward reducing debt load and returning capital to shareholders.RisksOne factor that could offset the positives to some extent is that Hess has been persistently generating lower dividend yields than the market over the past few years. The partnership’s dividend yield of 1.1% is lower than the industry average of 1.7%.Story continuesKey PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

249,90e7292a-9119-3a0d-87ad-c574b672d569,HP,2022-12-29,Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) shareholders have earned a 109% return over the last year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-nyse-hp-shareholders-134409619.html,1672235049,STORY,['HP'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Take, for example Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP). Its share price is already up an impressive 103% in the last twelve months. On top of that, the share price is up 31% in about a quarter. The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 8.1% higher than it was three years ago.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne We don't think that Helmerich &amp; Payne's modest trailing twelve month profit has the market's full attention at the moment. We think revenue is probably a better guide. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.Helmerich &amp; Payne grew its revenue by 69% last year. That's stonking growth even when compared to other loss-making stocks. And the share price has responded, gaining 103% as we previously mentioned. It's great to see strong revenue growth, but the question is whether it can be sustained. Given the positive sentiment around the stock we're cautious, but there's no doubt its worth watching.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthHelmerich &amp; Payne is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Helmerich &amp; Payne in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Helmerich &amp; Payne, it has a TSR of 109% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 109% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 0.7% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Helmerich &amp; Payne (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.But note: Helmerich &amp; Payne may not be the best stock to buy.

On that day, Comcast is projected to report earnings of $0.78 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1.3%.

The company quickly rolled out an ad-supported tier, in a reversal of its years-long resistance to the idea, and is aiming to try to monetize rampant password-sharing in 2023. Media conglomerates Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery have been forced to rationalize streaming investments, as Wall Street has refocused on bottom-line results rather than subscriber numbers.In 2023, for major streaming services, “there’s an intensifying focus on profitability and free cash flow generation,” amid uncertainty about which way the economic winds will blow, notes John Harrison, Americas media and entertainment leader at EY. He adds, “We’re moving to this really large decision point for media companies where they need to reconfirm their commitment to direct-to-consumer [streaming] — to make it as robust and attractive as possible — or they need to say, ‘Long term, this won’t be as big as we expected.'”Here are five key questions heading into the new year for the sector.How Will Bob Iger Recalibrate Disney’s Streaming Strategy?Iger is back as Disney’s CEO, taking over for the ousted Bob Chapek. Iger has already signaled that he intends to pull back on “aggressive marketing and aggressive spend on content” for Disney+ in favor of profitability. How that exactly will play out in 2023 is an open question. MoffettNathanson principal analyst Michael Nathanson, in a research note this month, opined that Disney+ would be better served by focusing on “premium branded IP” rather than general entertainment or sports. “We think new CEO Bob Iger should address the long-term viability” of Disney+’s previous growth targets “and reduce investment in general entertainment content,” Nathanson wrote. On a similar front, there’s the question of Hulu’s future ownership (Comcast has the right to sell its 33% Hulu ownership stake to Disney as early as January 2024, and conversely Disney can require Comcast to sell it at that point). Chapek had expressed an interest in doing a deal with Comcast to bring Hulu fully into the Mouse House fold sooner rather than later. Iger may have different thoughts on Hulu’s strategic value to Disney going forward.Story continuesWill Netflix’s Ad Tier and Password-Sharing Monetization Move the Needle?Netflix sees an opportunity to generate millions in new revenue through its ad-supported streaming play, while it’s also going to start nagging password-sharing violators to pay up for illicit account piggybackers in early 2023. How well the company can execute on these plans remains to be seen. Third-party data indicates the ad tier is off to a relatively slow start. The revenue Netflix can realize from account-sharing customers will be gated by how aggressively the company intends to push — and signs point to a gentler honor-system approach, at least at first.What Will the Combined HBO Max-Discovery+ Platform Look Like?Warner Bros. Discovery is hoping a merged HBO Max-Discovery+ platform, set to debut in the U.S. next spring, will prove that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts — and help justify Discovery’s gargantuan acquisition of WarnerMedia. But it’s still unclear how WBD will manage the transition: The company has not announced pricing or packaging details, much less a name for the combo (“Max” is among the contenders). At a high level, EY’s Harrison says, it makes sense for streaming providers to move toward consolidation and bundling. “For all the companies with multiple streaming apps… there has to be a decision about whether the most compelling offering is pushing everything into a single app and reducing as much friction as possible,” he says.How Much FAST-er Will FAST Get?In 2022, free, ad-supported television streaming (FAST) continued to accelerate. Paramount’s Pluto TV, Fox’s Tubi, Amazon’s Freevee and the Roku Channel saw gains that in some cases outpaced the growth of subscription-based services. Now others are looking to jump into the FAST lane, including Warner Bros. Discovery: WBD announced plans to license certain content that has been on HBO Max — including “Westworld,” “The Nevers,” “Raised by Wolves” and “FBoy Island” — to third-party FAST partners. And Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav has said the media company will be “aggressively attacking” the low end of the streaming market with its own FAST offering to launch sometime in 2023.How Will YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket Deal Change the Game?Google is betting football fans will flock to NFL’s Sunday Ticket on YouTube — which, for the first time starting with the 2023 season, will be available to anyone in the U.S. without the purchase of a pay-TV package (as has been the case with long-time distributor DirecTV). Google will need to sign up at least 2.25 million Sunday Ticket subs to break even on the deal, according to an estimate by Baird senior research analyst Colin Sebastian. But it could turn out to be a loss-leader for YouTube as the video giant looks to siphon away more TV ad dollars and pack on more YouTube TV customers. Under the seven-year pact, Google will reportedly pay the NFL at least $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket.RSVP todayBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in January 2023What's Coming to Disney+ in January 2023Oscar Predictions: Live Action Short - Alfonso Cuarón and Disney are Early Favorites Among Multiple Non-English and International Titles]"

The company is spending heavily on content that is helping it to win international subscribers as the U.S. streaming market becomes saturated.In third-quarter 2022, Netflix witnessed subscriber growth in international markets. The paid subscriber base for Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific increased 0.57 million, 0.31 million and 1.43 million, respectively.Netflix’s ever-expanding foreign language content portfolio has been a major growth driver, as the company continues to face stiff competition from the likes of Disney DIS, Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA in the streaming space.Netflix’s latest Japanese show, season 2 of Alice in Borderland, has become a hit, with 61.2 million hours viewed over its premiere weekend. The show debuts as the #1 on Netflix’s non-English TV show list for the Dec 19-25 week. Season 1 of Alice in Borderland trailed the latest season with 18.7 million hours viewed. Reborn Rich, with 17 million hours viewed, grabbed the #3 spot.Expanding footprint is expected to further boost prospects. The streaming giant recently announced a couple of Danish titles, including the thriller series, The Nurse, and the feature film, A Beautiful Life, scheduled to be launched in 2023. A couple of other Danish titles to be launched include Nicolas Winding Refn’s Copenhagen Cowboy and Ehrengard, a Danish feature film directed by Bille August.Apart from Danish language content, Netflix is expanding Korean content. Five Korean shows were launched this month, including Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area Part 2 (Dec 9), Alchemy of Souls (Dec 10), Single’s Inferno Season 2 (Dec 13), The Interest of Love (Dec 21) and The Fabulous (Dec 23).

NFLX shares have also underperformed Apple, Comcast and Disney shares, which have declined 27.6%, 30.9% and 44.3%, respectively.Netflix is suffering from waning demand, as the subscriber base dwindles amid tough competition. Netflix’s latest ad-supported service also failed to excite its user base. The ad-supported plan, launched on Nov 3, accounted for only 9% of new Netflix sign-ups in the United States during November.Moreover, Netflix is expected to face competition in the ad-supported streaming market from the likes of Disney and Comcast.Disney followed in the footsteps of Netflix to offer its ad-supported tier starting Dec 8, 2022. The company’s streaming service Disney+, as of Oct 1, 2022, had 164.2 million paid subscribers compared with 118.1 million as of Oct 2, 2021.Comcast’s Peacock also offers a free-to-watch tier with ad support that has about 40,000 hours of content. Peacock is well poised to grow, owing to its vast library of IPs and new productions.Nevertheless, Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the insurance industry and go directly to 5 Best Life Insurance Companies.The global life insurance industry is experiencing a slowdown due to the ongoing economic downturn. It is especially true for term-life policies since high inflation risks decreasing the death benefit. Regardless, the industry is grounded across the world, and especially in the US, with three in four Americans having some sort of life insurance policy according to a Forbes survey. The life insurance industry has grown at a relatively faster pace in the developing world, with the expansion of its middle class. Figures from McKinsey show that the developing world has added 52% in the growth of global premium in the past decade. Industry AnalysisMcKinsey’s 2023 Insurance report shows a significant gap between economic growth and premium growth around the world. For instance, the US and the EU had a nominal GDP growth at a CAGR of 5% in the past 20 years. However, life insurance premiums grew at a CAGR of only 2%. There are several reasons for this. The most important one being the problem of cost base. Cost, as a share of revenue, has increased by 23% in the life insurance industry since 2003. For comparison, it has only increased by 5% in the Property and Casualty Insurance industry. This, combined with high earnings-volatility, low performance mobility and risk opacity has largely driven investors away from the industry. This trend is reflected in the life-insurance industry's market cap in the US relative to other financial services. It decreased from 40% in 1985 to 17% in 2005, to just 9% in 2020. However, some new trends might change things for the better. For example, numerous life insurance companies have moved away from affiliated distribution due to increased commoditization of the insurance products. Affiliated distributors have lost the market by 4% in the past decade, per the iii.org. Conversely, independent distributors have gained popularity, with their market share increasing from 44% in 2012 to 50% in 2021. The trend is smoothed out across the world. Story continuesAnother key statistic from iii.org reveals that traditional life insurance has also lost mainstream popularity in favor of life/annuity policies, which made up 48% of premiums written in the year 2021. Future OutlookAccording to Research and Markets, the global life insurance market is expected to grow at a modest CAGR of 4.4% and reach $3.5 trillion in value by 2025. Further, it is projected to reach $4.2 trillion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.7% during the forecast period of 2025-2030.The growth is mainly going to be driven by transforming technologies like AI and Big Data, allowing for highly personalized policies. Personalized life insurance is expected to greatly transform the industry since different people have different needs that are hard to pin down in a few categories. Traditionally, life insurance coverage has been estimated using Needs-Approach, and while it does account for unique needs of different individuals, it does not offer nearly the same level of detail that can be achieved using Big Data and AI. The industry is already adapting, with AI startups like Loadsure, Concirrus and Sherpa. As far as industry players go, some of the most prominent companies in the life insurance industry are MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) and State Farm. In the case of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU), it offers term, universal, indexed universal and variable-universal life insurance policies.Below, we list the 12 best life insurance companies.12 Best Life Insurance Companiesaustin-distel-jpHw8ndwJ_Q-unsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of the 12 best life insurance companies, we’ve identified the consensus picks from Investopedia, US News, Forbes Advisor and Nerdwallet that rated insurance companies from 1 to 5 stars. We've ranked companies based on number of positive ratings, with their mean score being the tiebreaker. We've factored-in the AM Best grading for companies' financial stability in our ranking, as the most important metric. AM Best is a credit rating agency specializing in insurance companies that grades their financial stength from A++ to S, with grade A++ indicating the highest level of financial strength and S representing the lowest.Here are the 12 best life insurance companies:12. Mutual of OmahaNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.7 AM Best Grade: A+Mutual of Omaha is 12th on our list of best life insurance companies. Mutual of Omaha has some unique offerings like Return-of-Premium-Term-Insurance as well as a disability-income rider. It also offers at-least two accelerated death-benefit riders for the majority of its policies. A drawback is that the company does not offer whole-life insurance and variable-universal life insurance policies. When it comes to term policies of the company, these vary from 10-year to 30-year terms. Mutual of Omaha has two term-life products, namely, Term-Life Answers and Term-Life Express. The latter does not require a medical exam.11. Protective LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.8 AM Best Grade: A+Protective Life is an Alabama-based life insurance company that is highly regarded for its term-life policies. It has a rating of 4.6 stars on Investopedia and 5 stars on Forbes Advisor. Protective Life is one of the few life insurance companies that provides up to 40-year coverage in term-life policies. The coverage amounts anywhere from $0.1 million to $50 million. It also provides options to switch to permanent policies without the requirement of a medical examination.10. Pacific LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 5 AM Best Grade: A+Pacific Life is based in Newport Beach, California. It provides life insurance policies like term, whole and permanent life insurance, as well as annuities, pension plans and investment options in mutual funds. The company has a 5-star rating on Forbes Advisor for good performance in cash-value growth, cost competitiveness and reliability of policy illustrations. Pacific Life also has a 5-star rating on Nerdwallet, with its indexed universal life insurance mentioned as one of the best for growing investments based on indexes like S&amp;P 500. These policies come with a guarantee that the company will maintain the principal sum even if the stock market takes a nosedive. 9. Lincoln Financial GroupNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.4 AM Best Grade: A+Lincoln Financial Group is one of the best insurance companies according to various ratings. It is owned and operated by Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC). It has a rating of 3.9 stars on US News, 4.3 stars on Investopedia and a 5-star rating on Forbes Advisor. Lincoln Financial Group offers term life and universal life insurance policies. One of the disadvantages with Lincoln Financial Group is that it does not offer whole life insurance. One of its advantages, on the other hand, is no upfront costs for some of its living-benefit riders. There are six available riders from Lincoln Financial Group. Three of these are accelerated death benefits for terminal, critical and chronic illnesses. Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) is one of the top names alongside MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) and Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) when it comes to publicly traded insurance companies. 8. NationwideNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.5 AM Best Grade: A+Nationwide requires no medical exam for coverage of up to $5 million. It also includes at-least three living benefits in most of its life insurance policies. Nationwide is also one of the best insurance companies when it comes to customer satisfaction. Its 2021 NAIC index is 0.05, implying that it received far fewer than baseline complaints from policyholders than many other insurance companies. Another feature that sets the company apart is its variety of life insurance policies. Nationwide offers term, whole, universal, indexed universal, simplified whole, variable life and final-expense life insurance policies. It has eight riders including benefits for chronic, critical and terminal illnesses. 7. USAANumber of Positive Ratings: 2  Average Score: 4.5 AM Best Grade: A++USAA is one of the best life insurance companies according to US News and Nerdwallet, where it has ratings of 4.1 and 5 respectively. It provides term, whole and universal life insurance policies. Unlike its other policies, which are exclusive to military members and their families, its life insurance policies are available for regular US citizens and green card holders. However, USAA provides additional perks to military members in their life insurance policies as well, such as expediting their application if they’re being deployed.USAA is owned by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is diversified across financial services apart from insurance services unlike Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), which is entirely concentrated in the insurance industry. 6. New York LifeNumber of Positive Ratings: 3 Average Score: 4.2 AM Best Grade: A++New York Life is the third largest insurance company in the US. It has a rating of 3.7 stars on the US News, 4 stars on Investopedia and a 5-star rating on Nerdwallet.  New York Life offers term, whole, universal and variable-universal life insurance policies. It offers a huge selection of policy riders and even offers policies for 90-year olds. The company also offers flexible payment options on some of its whole-life insurance policies, enabling policyholders to pay off their premiums earlier. Nerdwallet describes the company as the best for high coverage amounts. An attractive feature about New York Life’s whole-life insurance policies is that policyholders are eligible for annual dividends by the company and New York Life has consecutively paid dividends for 168 years, owing to its financial strength. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Insurance Companies.   Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Companies That Offer Pensions10 Biggest Fixed Income ETFs in America10 Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: none. 12 Best Insurance Companies is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Rises: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 779 for the week ended Dec 22. The figure is higher than the prior week’s count of 776. The tally increased in five of the prior eight weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 586.The onshore rigs in the week ended Dec 22 totaled 762, higher than the prior week’s count of 759. In offshore resources, 15 rigs were operating, in line with the prior week’s count.U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises: The oil rig count was 622 for the week ended Dec 22, higher than the prior-week figure of 620. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 480.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Increases: Natural gas rig count of 155 is higher than the prior-week figure of 154. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 106. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.3% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 27 units, higher than the prior-week count of 26. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 752 is higher than the prior-week level of 750.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Flat: GoM rig count was 15 units, all oil-directed. The count was in line with the prior-week number.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 349, higher than the prior week's count of 347. The tally increased in seven of the prior 12 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $75-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook.

See our latest analysis for Oracle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At OracleOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Charles Moorman for US$1.3m worth of shares, at about US$84.57 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$80.33. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeOracle is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of OracleAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Oracle insiders own 43% of the company, worth about US$93b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Oracle shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Oracle insiders think the business has merit. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Oracle that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Oracle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Some experts believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and industry, while others are more cautious about its potential impact. The artificial intelligence sector is thriving across the globe. AI-enabled tools, like smarter chat-bots for customer service and robots for self-service at banks, are gaining traction in the mainstream. AI applications are also present in home appliances, phones, hospitals, agriculture, and the military. Globally, AI has been rapidly integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations.  An increase in demand for smart homes and smart cities is expected to propel the artificial intelligence chip market growth going forward. Though 2022 was a rough year for businesses, the stock market tanked, interest rates spiked and many thousands of people lost their jobs, there was exponential growth in the AI industry in 2022 as projects like self-driving cars became immensely popular. By 2030, it is expected that artificial intelligence is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy, representing 26% of the global GDP. According to recent research, the global AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49.26 billion in 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 34.6% from 2021 onwards. Some of the top firms working in AI include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Investors eager to jump on this growth bandwagon should consider carefully the predictions made by top market experts regarding the products of these firms and how they are expected to fare in the future.For example, it is expected that content automation is going be a major theme in the AI market moving forward. AI-capable software has developed the coding required to produce a variety of original content, including images, video, music, audio, and language. Research firm Gartner expects that by 2025, 30% of outbound messages from major enterprises will be synthetically generated.  It is also predicted that more firms will focus on building AI systems for mass production in the coming years.Story continuesRicardo Michel Reyes, a top executive at research platform Erudit, believes that another exciting trend in AI is quantum computing, which has been around for around 7 years but will have applications in the next 25 years or so. Per the expert, quantum computers are even more powerful than supercomputers in solving complex problems. Compared to the progress that traditional computers have made in the past sixty years, it is expected that quantum computers will evolve at an even rapid scale.There are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of AI, such as job displacement and ethical issues related to the use of intelligent systems. Some experts believe that it will be important for society to carefully consider the implications of AI and to establish guidelines for its responsible development and use.There are many experts on artificial intelligence (AI) who come from a variety of backgrounds and fields of study. Some of the key figures in the field of AI include: French computer scientist Yann LeCun, Chinese-American computer scientist Andrew Ng, Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, Chinese-American computer scientist Fei-Fei Li, and German-American computer scientist Sebastian Thrun. You can look for these people's published work to read more about the future of artificial intelligence.Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The details of each AI company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Hedge fund sentiment is also included for further clarity on the money being poured into these firms and the confidence that elite investors have in their success. Please check out our recent articles 15 Biggest AI Companies in the World and 13 Most Advanced Countries in AI on this topic.The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 10 Companies, 10 PredictionsThe Future of Artificial Intelligence: 10 Companies, 10 Predictions10. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67    Related Prediction: Businesses Can Build a Much Brighter Future Where Humans Are Relieved of Menial Work Using AI CapabilitiesOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. Oracle masters in rapidly building, training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. Additionally, broadening access to business applications with chatbots and conversational AI interfaces are a few services offered by Oracle Corp. Andrew Ng, an American computer scientist and technology entrepreneur, has already underscored how businesses can build a much brighter future where humans are relieved of menial work using AI capabilities. On December 14, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman maintained a Market Perform rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $95 from $90, highlighting that the company maintained a forecast of greater than 30% y/y CC organic Cloud growth in FY23.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the top AI stocks to buy now according to elite investors.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.”9. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Related Prediction: AI Shows Tremendous Progress in a Very Short Time and Will Grow as The Demand for Hybrid Cloud IncreasesCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs, manufactures and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, Japan, and China. Cisco has a range of cloud and network management tools based on AI technology, like Kube Flow and consistent AI. The Kube Flow project is dedicated to making deployments of ML workflows simple, portable, and scalable. The project has also partnered with tech giant Google for cloud services. Debo Dutta, a visiting scholar in Stanford University, has said that the project has made tremendous progress in a very short time and will grow as the demand for hybrid cloud life cycles increases. On December 13, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $52 from $48, noting that estimate revisions are more likely to come late in the first half of 2023 as backlogs clear and the demand picture becomes clearer.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69     Related Prediction: Data is The New OilIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. While Intel is not primarily an artificial intelligence (AI) company, it does have a significant presence in the AI market and has made significant investments in AI-related technologies.Intel has developed a number of AI products and solutions, including hardware, software, and services that enable businesses and organizations to build, deploy, and manage AI applications. For example, Intel offers AI-optimized processors, such as its Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which are designed to provide high performance and efficiency for AI workloads. Intel also offers a range of AI software tools and platforms, such as its Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit, which helps developers build and deploy AI applications on a variety of platforms.One of the top AI-related products of the firm is BigDL 2.0, a tool that makes it easier for data scientists and data engineers to build end-to-end, distributed AI applications. Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur in the field of data science, had predicted the use of big data on such a mass scale, even going as far as to say that data is the new oil.On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock with a Neutral rating and $32 price target, noting that the company has seen increased challenges in both the server and PC markets with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and softening PC demand.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74    Related Prediction: Cloud Computing Is Just a Better Way to Run BusinessMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. A top AI product of the firm is the Micron 9300 NVMe SSD, a drive that meets the demands of performance-critical cloud and data center workloads with the speed, performance and capacity of flagship performers. Marc Benioff, the CEO of software giant Salesforce, has underlined how these devices are critical to businesses, saying recently that cloud computing is just a better way to run your business.On December 7, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it would not be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     Related Prediction: Machine Learning Will Increase Productivity Throughout the Supply Chain and Transform AutomationAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. AMD offers AI-focused hardware, including graph inference engines that accelerate machine learning model inferences. The engines, AMD MIGraphX, can be used by installing binaries directly or building from source code. Dave Waters, a top petrological expert and renowned AI expert, had predicted the use of these AI-focused tools in business, saying that machine learning will increase productivity throughout the supply chain and transform automation.On November 15, Credit Suisse analyst Chris Caso assumed coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock with an Outperform rating and $90 price target, noting that the advisory expected further server share gains and cloud market growth.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the top AI stocks to buy now according to elite investors.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more) Click to continue reading and see The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 5 Companies, 5 Predictions. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

263,bdeed024-f5de-3def-a8a7-e23df4d9d5cd,PSA,2022-12-29,These Five REITs Are Being Highlighted By Analysts As Investment Targets In 2023,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-reits-being-highlighted-analysts-160613723.html,1672243573,STORY,"['SUI', 'AMT', 'PSA-PM']","[If you invested in a real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2022, you know it’s been a wild ride.While many REITs performed better than the S&amp;P 500, many also experienced double-digit and, in some cases, as high as 50% declines over 2021 performance though performing steadily throughout the year.The hope is that the Federal Reserve will have successfully raised interest rates enough to corral inflation, and REITs, especially those in the residential space, are hoping to capitalize on continued demand properties in cities that still lack inventory, meaning rent prices could continue to climb.Heading into 2023, there is hope for REITs that have found a niche in residential housing and a mix of self-storage, medical, manufactured housing and cell tower operators.REITs investment analysts have highlighted as potential investment targets in 2023 include:Global Medical REIT Inc.Seeking Alphas’ Jussi Askola:Though dropping by 40% year-to-date, Global Medical REIT Inc.’s (NYSE: GMRE) business has performed well even as its share price collapsed. Askola believes the crash is unjustified and as a result has become deeply undervalued. Priced at a large discount to fair value, it offers a margin of safety that should limit the downside. It also offers significant upside potential in a future recovery. Its share price could rise by over 50%, and its valuation would still be reasonable.Equity ResidentialZacks Investment Research:Based in Chicago, Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is one of the leading, publicly-traded multifamily REITs in the U.S. It is well-positioned to benefit from its portfolio rebalancing efforts and a strong balance sheet. Equity Residential’s efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets with an affluent tenant base bode well.Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds. Estimates have been revised marginally upward over the past two months to $3.53, though the company’s shares have declined 12.3% so far in the fourth quarter.Story continuesPublic StorageKiplinger.com:Self-storage REITs are one of the world's most recession-resistant segments. While other real estate suffered 25% to 67% net losses during the Great Recession, the self-storage segment grew profits by 5%. Public Storage (NYSE: PSA), the self-storage behemoth, is the market leader and has top market shares in 14 of the 15-largest U.S. markets and more than twice as many locations as its next-largest competitor.Since 2019, Public Storage has expanded its portfolio by 23% and made over $7.4 billion of new investments. While dividend growth has been a lower priority than portfolio expansion and debt reduction, the REIT recently rewarded its investors with a $13.15 per share special dividend. With operating cash flow exceeding $2.4 billion so far this year, total liquidity exceeding $1 billion and payout from funds from operations (FFO) currently at 52%, Public Storage has plenty of dry powder to support dividend growth.Sun Communities Inc.Kiplinger and Zacks:America's leading owner/operator of manufactured housing, recreational vehicle (RV) parks and marinas, Michigan-based Sun Communities Inc.’s (NYSE: SUI) existing portfolio is made up of 352 manufactured housing communities, 179 RV parks and 131 marinas. Additionally, the REIT boasts a strong development pipeline consisting of 9,000 manufactured housing sites and 7,000 RV sites. Sun Communities' portfolio occupancy levels are 97.1% in North America and 91.7% in the U.K., where it owns 55 RV holiday parks. It benefits from compelling supply-demand fundamentals for manufactured housing. Sun Communities received approximately 43,000 applications for sites in its housing communities this year.Over the past decade, Sun Communities has generated 9.2% core FFO per share growth, significantly outperforming the major REIT and broad-market indexes. Dividend growth has averaged 5.5% annually over five years, and the payout is exceptionally conservative for a REIT at 47% of FFO.American Tower Corp.Kiplinger.com:Boston-based American Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT) owns and operates wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure in several countries. It was ranked 375th on the Fortune 500 in 2022. This REIT's dividends have increased 20% annually since 2012, and analysts forecast 18% annual growth through 2025. American Tower’s dividend is well-covered, with an FFO payout of around 64%. Over the past decade, American Tower has generated robust gains in revenues of up 14.2% annually, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of up 14.1% per year and adjusted FFO per share, rising 13.8% annually.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Micron Technology MU, STMicroelectronics STM, Microchip Technology MCHP and Taiwan Semiconductor TSM.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Forget Micron (MU): Buy These 4 Semiconductor Stocks InsteadMicron Technology’s shares have plunged 46.3% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s declines of 36% and 20.6%, respectively. Though the broader market sell-off has somewhat affected the stock’s performance, the main reasons behind this slump are company-specific.The company is suffering from dampened memory-chip demand, as customers are adjusting inventories in response to macroeconomic headwinds like supply-chain issues for certain components, negatively impacting bit shipments in the near term, and possible fear of economic recession.Micron kicked off fiscal 2023 on a disappointing note, registering year-over-year declines of 101.9% and 46.8% in its first-quarter earnings and revenues, respectively. The company registered sales declines in almost all of its end markets on a quarter-over-quarter basis. MU cited rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across all of its end markets as the reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Such a scenario is likely to further dim the Idaho-headquartered leading semiconductor memory solution provider’s financial performance in the next few quarters. Micron’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenue guidance of $3.80 billion (+/- $200 million) indicates a year-over-year loss of 51%. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s adjusted loss per share projection of 62 cents (+/-10 cents) indicates a year-over-year decline of 129%.Story continuesMicron’s heavy dependence on China is anticipated to keep the company under pressure in the near term. Given that the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest importer, the persistent tit-for-tat trade war between the nations poses a threat to the company.Last week, Micron disclosed a restructuring plan to reduce its headcount by 10% throughout 2023 in response to the technology industry slowdown that is affecting employment conditions. The company decided to reduce staff through voluntary attrition or layoffs to prepare for the potential recession and Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes. It is, therefore, advisable to stay away from this semiconductor maker in the near term.3 Semiconductor Stocks to Bet onThough Micron’s prospects might not appear appealing, there are some other stocks in the semiconductor industry that offer good investment opportunities right now.

Doing so prevents dividends in arrears from further accruing and is a wise use of the company’s free cash flow. I believe the choice to initiate a cash dividend is a tacit admission by the company that the necessary conditions for converting the preferred shares will not be met soon. This is a mild short-term negative, as the complex capital structure will remain in place for now.

Some experts believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and industry, while others are more cautious about its potential impact. The artificial intelligence sector is thriving across the globe. AI-enabled tools, like smarter chat-bots for customer service and robots for self-service at banks, are gaining traction in the mainstream. AI applications are also present in home appliances, phones, hospitals, agriculture, and the military. Globally, AI has been rapidly integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations.  An increase in demand for smart homes and smart cities is expected to propel the artificial intelligence chip market growth going forward. Though 2022 was a rough year for businesses, the stock market tanked, interest rates spiked and many thousands of people lost their jobs, there was exponential growth in the AI industry in 2022 as projects like self-driving cars became immensely popular. By 2030, it is expected that artificial intelligence is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy, representing 26% of the global GDP. According to recent research, the global AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49.26 billion in 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 34.6% from 2021 onwards. Some of the top firms working in AI include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Investors eager to jump on this growth bandwagon should consider carefully the predictions made by top market experts regarding the products of these firms and how they are expected to fare in the future.For example, it is expected that content automation is going be a major theme in the AI market moving forward. AI-capable software has developed the coding required to produce a variety of original content, including images, video, music, audio, and language. Research firm Gartner expects that by 2025, 30% of outbound messages from major enterprises will be synthetically generated.  It is also predicted that more firms will focus on building AI systems for mass production in the coming years.Story continuesRicardo Michel Reyes, a top executive at research platform Erudit, believes that another exciting trend in AI is quantum computing, which has been around for around 7 years but will have applications in the next 25 years or so. Per the expert, quantum computers are even more powerful than supercomputers in solving complex problems. Compared to the progress that traditional computers have made in the past sixty years, it is expected that quantum computers will evolve at an even rapid scale.There are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of AI, such as job displacement and ethical issues related to the use of intelligent systems. Some experts believe that it will be important for society to carefully consider the implications of AI and to establish guidelines for its responsible development and use.There are many experts on artificial intelligence (AI) who come from a variety of backgrounds and fields of study. Some of the key figures in the field of AI include: French computer scientist Yann LeCun, Chinese-American computer scientist Andrew Ng, Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, Chinese-American computer scientist Fei-Fei Li, and German-American computer scientist Sebastian Thrun. You can look for these people's published work to read more about the future of artificial intelligence.Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The details of each AI company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Hedge fund sentiment is also included for further clarity on the money being poured into these firms and the confidence that elite investors have in their success.

Andrew Ng, an American computer scientist and technology entrepreneur, has already underscored how businesses can build a much brighter future where humans are relieved of menial work using AI capabilities. On December 14, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman maintained a Market Perform rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $95 from $90, highlighting that the company maintained a forecast of greater than 30% y/y CC organic Cloud growth in FY23.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the top AI stocks to buy now according to elite investors.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.”9. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Related Prediction: AI Shows Tremendous Progress in a Very Short Time and Will Grow as The Demand for Hybrid Cloud IncreasesCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs, manufactures and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, Japan, and China.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $52 from $48, noting that estimate revisions are more likely to come late in the first half of 2023 as backlogs clear and the demand picture becomes clearer.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69     Related Prediction: Data is The New OilIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. While Intel is not primarily an artificial intelligence (AI) company, it does have a significant presence in the AI market and has made significant investments in AI-related technologies.Intel has developed a number of AI products and solutions, including hardware, software, and services that enable businesses and organizations to build, deploy, and manage AI applications. For example, Intel offers AI-optimized processors, such as its Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which are designed to provide high performance and efficiency for AI workloads. Intel also offers a range of AI software tools and platforms, such as its Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit, which helps developers build and deploy AI applications on a variety of platforms.One of the top AI-related products of the firm is BigDL 2.0, a tool that makes it easier for data scientists and data engineers to build end-to-end, distributed AI applications. Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur in the field of data science, had predicted the use of big data on such a mass scale, even going as far as to say that data is the new oil.On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock with a Neutral rating and $32 price target, noting that the company has seen increased challenges in both the server and PC markets with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and softening PC demand.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74    Related Prediction: Cloud Computing Is Just a Better Way to Run BusinessMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. A top AI product of the firm is the Micron 9300 NVMe SSD, a drive that meets the demands of performance-critical cloud and data center workloads with the speed, performance and capacity of flagship performers.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     Related Prediction: Machine Learning Will Increase Productivity Throughout the Supply Chain and Transform AutomationAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more) Click to continue reading and see The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 5 Companies, 5 Predictions. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

You can skip our overview and go directly to the 5 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2022.The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that represents the performance of 30 large, publicly traded companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and most widely followed stock market indices in the world. It was first published in 1896 and has since become a benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market. The index is calculated based on the stock prices of the 30 companies that make up the index, with each company's weight in the index determined by its market capitalization (the total value of its outstanding shares).The Dow Jones Industrial Average is often used as a barometer of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. The index has provided a total return of -9.3% YTD (including dividends reinvested), which reflects the worsening health of the US economy in 2022 as the FED continues to raise interest rates. The current year will mark a year of negative performance after three consecutive years of strong positive returns in 2019, 2020, and 2021.The 30 component stocks of the DJIA are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, and they are chosen based on the overall importance of the companies to the economy and the stock market. The index is reconstituted often as new companies are added while the older ones get replaced. The most recent reconstitution in the index occurred in 2020 when companies like Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) were added to the index, while Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) were removed.

The Defensive sector which comprises 29.49% of the total weightage of the Dow, may be a reason why the index performed better than others in the current year.

271,62bfc345-f5c5-3dcd-a3fd-8a14f46a00a6,PLD,2022-12-29,Prologis Vs Rexford Industrial Realty: Which Is The Better Buy?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-vs-rexford-industrial-realty-154130308.html,1672242090,STORY,"['PLD', 'REXR-PC']","[Industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) have performed well over the past five years as increased demand for warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other logistics properties have propelled earnings for this sector.But interest rate hikes and recessionary fears have put a damper on the 2022 performance of many industrial REITs, with prices down 30% or more over the past 52 weeks.Take a look at a comparison of two of the best industrial REITs, both having excellent long-term track records. Still, one is clearly better than the other:Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages 4,914 industrial logistics properties from New York to California and in 18 other countries. Its market capitalization is $104.88 billion.Rexford Industrial Realty Inc. (NYSE: REXR) is a Los Angeles-based industrial REIT with 346 properties it owns or manages, all of which are in Southern California’s high-growth areas. Its market capitalization is $10.63 billion.Size and DiversityPrologis has a much larger market cap, 14 times more properties across the U.S. and a diversity of international properties. Rexford Industrial Realty is much smaller and far less diversified. Prologis is clearly better in this category.Performance Over TimeBoth REITs have performed well. In long-term performance since 2013, Prologis has a total return of 228%. Over the same time frame, Rexford Industrial Realty is up 334%. Over the past 52 weeks, both stocks are down just under 30%. Rexford Industrial Realty is the easy winner of this category.Dividend YieldPrologis pays an annual dividend of $3.16, for a present yield of 2.78%, while Rexford Industrial Realty pays an annual dividend of $1.26 for a present yield of 2.31%. While neither company has a very high yield, Prologis has the better yield of the two.Dividend Growth and StabilityOver the past five years, Prologis grew its quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.79, an increase of 64%. During that same time, Rexford Industrial Realty hiked its dividend from $0.145 to $0.315, an increase of 117%. Neither REIT has cut its dividend over the past five years. Score this category for Rexford Industrial Realty.Story continuesDividend Coverage by FFOPrologis has forward funds from operations (FFO) of $5.12 and an annual dividend of $3.16, for an FFO payout ratio of 61.7%. Rexford Industrial Realty has forward FFO of $1.95 and pays a $1.26 annual dividend, for an FFO payout ratio of 64.6%. It’s close, but Prologis’ slightly lower FFO payout ratio wins this category.FFO Multiple (Price/FFO)Prologis has an FFO multiple (P/FFO) of 22.17, while Rexford Industrial Realty has a FFO multiple (P/FFO) of 28.02. The lower multiple gives the edge in this category again to Prologis.Debt RatioPrologis has total debt of $18.67 billion, and its ratio of debt/equity is 47.13. Rexford Industrial Realty has total debt of $1.95 billion and its debt/equity ratio is 29.72. Owning far more properties will naturally give Prologis a higher debt amount, but the significantly lower debt ratio means Rexford Industrial Realty is carrying a safer debt load so it wins this category.Most Recent Operating ResultsPrologis had revenue of $1.75 billion, up 48.3% from $118 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Core FFO per diluted share in the third quarter of 2022 was $1.73, compared to $1.04 in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 66%. Rexford Industrial Realty had revenue of $162.75, an increase of 41% from $115.40 in the third quarter of 2021. Core FFO per diluted share of $0.50 was an increase of 16.3% over the FFO of $0.47 from the third quarter of 2021.While both companies had very good third-quarter results, Prologis’s results were better, particularly on its FFO. Prologis wins this category.SummaryPrologis holds the advantage in the categories of size/diversity, dividend yield, dividend coverage by FFO, FFO multiple and most recent operating results.Rexford Industrial Realty has the edge in performance over time, dividend growth/stability and debt ratio.Prologis wins five categories to only three by Rexford Industrial Realty.These two industrial REITs are both high quality, but the overall better stock to buy, based on the preceding eight categories, is Prologis.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

(NYSE:PLD) insiders sold US$7.5m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-inc-nyse-pld-insiders-140029933.html,1672236029,STORY,['PLD'],"[Many Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis Prologis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.3m worth of shares at a price of US$165 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$113). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 24.00k shares for US$2.8m. On the other hand they divested 45.74k shares, for US$7.5m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Prologis shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Prologis Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, Prologis insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Independent Director David O’Connor spent US$1.0m on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesDoes Prologis Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$112m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Prologis insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Prologis (of which 2 are potentially serious!) you should know about.But note: Prologis may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Blackstone Inc. (BX) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.06 a share 29 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 26, 2023.BX has an Earnings ESP figure of 3.55%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.06 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02.BX is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Prologis (PLD) as well.Prologis, which is readying to report earnings on January 18, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.22 a share, and PLD is 21 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prologis is $1.21, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.74%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, BX and PLD could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.Recent times haven't been advantageous for American Express as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for American Express peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on American Express.Is There Some Growth For American Express?American Express' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.9% gain to the company's bottom line. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 21% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.9% per annum over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.3% each year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's understandable that American Express' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.The Bottom Line On American Express' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that American Express maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings won't throw up any surprises. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks.

Citing data from the partially government-owned China International Capital Corporation (CICC), the report finds that the rise in cases will create disrupted production and reduced demand.This all comes as China exits its zero-COVID strategy and enters the new year. The CICC report suggests that in Q1 OF next year, EV industry output will total 1.5 million deliveries, which would be a 40% decline from Q4, where the industry is expected to deliver 2.1 million vehicles.“The supply and demand sides of the industry will both be impacted by the pandemic,” CICC analysts wrote per the SCMP. “The number of visits by shoppers to their showrooms will also turn out to be lower [than in previous months].”China’s auto sector, which is responsible for 1 out of every 6 jobs in China’s labor force, is already feeling some effects of rising Covid cases as the country loosens restrictions. Tesla’s Giga Shanghai reportedly extended its Christmas break by day, with reports suggesting workers at Tesla and its suppliers were getting sick among the recent uptick in Covid cases.HUAI'AN, CHINA - DECEMBER 14, 2022 - A BYD new energy vehicle sales shop in Huai 'an city, Jiangsu province, China, Dec 14, 2022. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)All is not lost for China’s auto sector for 2023, however. The CICC report finds that by Q2, China based automakers will benefit from the government’s exit from the zero-COVID policy. CICC said automakers like BYD, Tesla, Nio and Li Auto had secured large future orders, and sales could recover as soon as the pandemic weakens.While a Q2 recovery is welcome news for the auto industry, not all analysts feel that way. It may take into the second half of next year to see if China is experiencing an economic recovery.“The first two quarters of next year are also going to be critical because they're going to help us understand just how long the Chinese economy needs to fully rebound,” said China Beige Book’s Shehzad Qazi in an interview with Yahoo Finance.Story continues“We are in a pretty deep hole right now, especially when you look at the property market, it is struggling,” he said. “By all accounts, the Chinese economy is very, very weak; this is not an overnight recovery story.”—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

279,9148dd2c-10d9-3237-ac76-c4c40609acaa,PNR,2022-12-29,Pentair (NYSE:PNR) investors are sitting on a loss of 3.8% if they invested five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pentair-nyse-pnr-investors-sitting-104046997.html,1672310446,STORY,['PNR'],"[For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Pentair plc (NYSE:PNR), since the last five years saw the share price fall 39%. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 39% in the last year.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Pentair To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).While the share price declined over five years, Pentair actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 29% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 6.4% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthPentair is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Pentair stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Pentair, it has a TSR of -3.8% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Pentair shareholders are down 38% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 24%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Pentair better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Pentair (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:SAM).Separately, investment management firm Artisan Partners also discussed Boston Beer’s hard seltzer business in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said about The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM):Story continues“We ended our campaigns in Boston Beer Company. Boston Beer Company sells a focused portfolio of alcoholic beverage brands. In recent years, the company has emerged as one of the leaders in the hard seltzer category, which has grown over 150% in each of the past three years (2018-2020). Boston Beer’s Truly brand, the second-largest seller of hard seltzer, has benefited from this growth and was core to our investment thesis. However, the hard seltzer category’s growth has recently slowed to single digits, falling short of high investor expectations and pressuring Boston Beer’s earnings upside. Truly’s growth was core to our investment thesis, and a recovery is uncertain; thus, we ended our investment campaign.”9. Tripadvisor, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing Energy Stocks in 2022. Dan Klein, Head of Energy Pathways at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said in a report dated December 12: ""China's COVID policy is the most important fundamental factor for global demand in commodities and energy in 2023 as its demand softness due to lockdowns in 2022 was a key safety valve for oil, gas, and coal markets, while Europe scrambled to replace Russian energy. With another year of vaccinations and growing frustrations with lockdowns domestically in China, restrictions will likely ease somewhat in 2023 and imports of fossil fuels can be expected to increase again.""The S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Energy Outlook 2023 forecasts that China's total energy demand will climb by 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from almost no growth in 2022. This will account for 47% of global energy demand growth in 2023. While China's imports will potentially return to full strength, India has generated solid demand in 2022, with imports of oil and coal significantly larger year-on-year, as it has absorbed meaningful volumes of Russian supply that were previously utilized by Europe.According to S&amp;P Global, commodity prices will normalize in 2023 as fundamentals head towards an equilibrium.  Natural gas, coal, and crude oil prices are all forecasted to be lower in 2023 as compared to 2022 levels. However, 2023 would be beneficial for refiners, and refined products are expected to be traded at high prices. Electricity prices are also set to decline, as renewables come into play and European policymakers cut dependance between natural gas and power prices. Demand for fossil fuels is set to skyrocket in 2023, which would add to the climate crisis given the high carbon dioxide emissions. The geopolitical instability, soft macroeconomic growth, and rampant inflation will continue to rattle the energy security versus energy transition debate. As the global market tries to adapt to the energy crisis with fuel substitution and alternate trade flows, the energy sector will undergo a major transformation worldwide. Story continuesTo play the boom in the energy sector, investors often seek to benefit from the moves of the biggest energy firms (see 17 Biggest Energy Companies in the US) as they spearhead the energy transition movement. While some investors pile into the top energy ETFs (see 10 Best Performing Energy ETFs in 2022), others look for undervalued equities in the sector (see 12 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy). Some of the best performing energy stocks in 2022 include Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc. (NYSE:NEX). Our Methodology We selected the following energy stocks based on positive share price gains year-to-date as of December 27.

However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”7. Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

Let’s see which oil and energy stock is the better buy at the moment.SynopsisHigher oil prices over the last two years have caused many oil and gas stocks to soar as these companies have been very profitable.BP has been able to profit from oil production, but it is also positioning itself to capitalize on the global economy’s transition to lower carbon fuels. To that note, BP has committed to becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.Occidental Petroleum has diversified businesses as well. Like BP, Occidental Petroleum operates as an integrated oil and gas company and also produces a variety of basic materials, petrochemicals, polymers, and special chemicals.Performance &amp; ValuationOXY shares are up +115% vs. BP’s +30% in 2022. Both stocks have crushed the S&amp;P 500’s -21%. Over the last two years, OXY’s total return is now +264% to top BP’s +83% and the benchmark’s +4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a valuation standpoint, BP and Occidental Petroleum stocks stand out despite their stellar performances in recent years. Warren Buffett has notably added to positions in Occidental Petroleum throughout the year. Yet BP stock might appear even more attractive.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of BP trade at just 3.9X forward earnings with OXY trading at a 6.6X forward earnings multiple. BP’s valuation is very intriguing considering the stock trades at $34 per share and roughly half the price of OXY at $62 a share. Even better, BP is enjoying favorable earnings estimate revisions.Growth &amp; Outlook BP earnings are expected to climb 135% in 2022 at $8.98 per share. This is up significantly from estimates of $8.48 a share 90 days ago. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop -26% after an extremely tough-to-follow year. Earnings estimates are slightly up from the beginning of the quarter.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, BP sales are projected to jump 45% this year and rise 6% in FY23 to $252.96 billion. FY23 sales are closing in on pre-pandemic levels and only 10% below 2019 sales of $282.61 billion.Looking at Occidental Petroleum, earnings are forecasted to climb 279% in 2022 at $9.68 per share. Earnings estimates have gone down from $10.93 a share last quarter. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -25% after an exceptional year. FY23 earnings estimates have also declined.Sales are projected to climb 42% this year and decline -10% in FY23 at $33.75 billion. Impressively, FY23 would still represent a 65% increase from 2019 sales of $20.39 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsOil &amp; Energy stocks are renowned for their stellar dividends, especially when business is strong. In this regard, BP has the edge with its very strong 4.06% annual dividend yield compared to OXY’s 0.81%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line BP stock appears to be the better buy over Occidental Petroleum at the moment. BP lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions for FY22 and FY23. In contrast, OXY stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the earnings outlook and top line growth are still impressive but earnings estimates have trended down.Both companies do appear to be strong long-term investments considering their current valuations and the ability to not depend solely on oil prices with diversity among their businesses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors who gain a little experience in the stock market should choose and hold on to their stocks for the long term. When it comes to diversification, Warren Buffett said:“Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.”Moreover, Warren Buffett tends to pick stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value and looks for a margin of safety.

He avoids struggling businesses, as he said: ""It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Warren Buffett acquired the majority share of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 1962 when its textile business was failing.

If the former walks away from the deal, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) is set to receive $3 billion from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Here is what FPA U.S. Core Equity Fund had to say about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“One of the Fund’s biggest winners in the first quarter was Activision Blizzard. On January 18, 2022 Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed to purchase ATVI for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. The Fund has been invested in ATVI since the second quarter of 2018.The investment thesis was threefold. First, the greater than $200 billion gaming industry is the largest and fastest growing form of entertainment in the world. More than three billion people play games currently and the population of global gamers is expected to grow faster than global population growth this decade.14 Second, ATVI has some of the best intellectual property in the gaming industry including Warcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. Third, ATVI has had a pristine balance sheet with net cash over the past four years, generated robust free cash flow and traded at an undemanding valuation.ATVI closed the quarter at $80.11—a nearly 16% discount to the acquisition price. Assuming it takes about a year for the deal to close, a 18.6% return seems to be good upside relative to the risk of a deal not closing due to anti -trust concerns. If the transaction closes it would make Microsoft the third-largest company in gaming by revenue behind Tencent and Sony. There is plenty of competition from these larger players as well as smaller competitors such as EA, Take-Two Interactive, Roblox and Epic Games’ Fortnite. The Fund remains invested in ATVI given the significant discount, but should the discount narrow in the coming quarters the Fund could reduce or eliminate the position.”6.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82 on December 23, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 176.44 points or 0.5% higher at 33,203.93. However, on December 27, stocks posted mixed performance, as yields rose and investors focused on the economic outlook for 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2% and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%. Stocks with deep links to the Chinese economy jumped as Covid restrictions loosened in the Asian region. Yields also propelled higher, which pressured growth stocks. Stocks are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008 and another month of losses, with the Dow and S&amp;P off by 8.2% and 19.4%, respectively, while the Nasdaq’s fell 34.4% year-to-date as of December 27. During December, the S&amp;P has plunged 5.9%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have plummeted 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively. The major averages are on their way for the largest monthly drops since September. Keith Lerner, Truist’s co-chief investment officer, noted: “It’s basically the continuation of high yields depressing growth, with redistribution into other sectors that are smaller, but not big enough to change the headline index.”With this market outlook in mind, investors are looking to buy stocks which have posted share price gains this year, in order to construct a well balanced portfolio. While some traders seek get-rich-quick stocks (see 12 Best Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy), others tend to gravitate towards stable dividend payers as a hedge against market turbulence (see 12 Dividend Stocks That Outperform S&amp;P 500). Although investors usually pile into the likes of stable income stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to navigate the volatile economic backdrop, another way to combat the consistently battered stock market is to invest in equities which have outperformed benchmark indices significantly and offer meaningful growth potential.  Story continuesOur Methodology We selected the NASDAQ stocks that offer year-to-date share price gains of more than 100% as of December 27.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Incyte Incyte's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Incyte's EPS has grown 28% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While Incyte did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$123m. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Incyte but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Incyte To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Incyte's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Incyte's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Of course, just because Incyte is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

(NASDAQ:INTU) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-intuit-inc-nasdaq-intu-110040567.html,1672311640,STORY,['INTU'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.8% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Intuit's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Intuit How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuit is:12% = US$1.9b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.12.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Intuit's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Intuit's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Intuit's moderate 13% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.As a next step, we compared Intuit's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 24% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is INTU worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether INTU is currently mispriced by the market.Is Intuit Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 32% (implying that the company retains 68% of its profits), it seems that Intuit is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Intuit is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 22% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 18%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuit's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Stryker The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StrykerIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Srikant T. Datar, sold US$130k worth of shares at a price of US$217 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$244, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 1.9% of Srikant T. Datar's holding.In the last year Stryker insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Stryker better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Stryker Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Stryker. In total, insiders sold US$268k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of StrykerFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Stryker insiders own 11% of the company, worth about US$10b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Stryker Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Stryker stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Stryker is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Stryker.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 10 most valuable UK companies.The UK is home to a highly developed economy which is one of the largest in Europe and the world. Its economy includes England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and is the fifth biggest exporter in the world as well as the fifth largest importer. With a GDP of $3.2 trillion in 2021, the UK has seen its economy grow by 7.4% in 2021 alone, showcasing a strong recovery after the pandemic dramatically impacted its economy. In 2020, when the pandemic caused the GDPs of most companies to contract, the UK was one of the worst affected countries among developed nations, as it saw a relatively higher number of deaths and infections, and its GDP fell by 9.3%, while the outlook doesn't look very positive either, which is bad news for the 30 most valuable UK companies.However, even though the UK's GDP increased significantly in 2021, anyone taking it as a sign that the economy has grown further in 2022 and 2023, and hence, investing in the country is a good option, should consider that due to inflation and interest rates, which we'll discuss in further detail in a bit, the UK's economic growth has slowed down significantly in 2022. According to the Office for National Statistics of the UK, the GDP in October 2022 only grew by 0.5% while it fell by 0.6% in September 2022, showing that the economy isn't as stable as one might hope for.30 most valuable UK companiesOne of the reasons behind this turbulence is the lack of political stability in a country where this doesn't really happen. There have already been three UK Prime Ministers in 2022, after Boris Johnson resigned, Liz Truss's disastrous policies saw her last just fifty days becoming the shortest serving Prime Minister in the UK, and now Rishi Sunak is the Prime Minister. This political instability has led to investors being reluctant to consider the UK as a prospect as political stability is a must for any country to continue growing.Story continuesAnother issue that the UK is facing is high levels of inflation, which is something most countries in the world are grappling with. However, the UK has been hit particularly hard, with the Consumer Price Index increasing by 9.3% in the twelve months to 2022. Energy prices however have increased much more significantly mainly due to the Russian Ukraine war, which has raised energy prices in many European countries, but the UK has been much more exposes due to numerous reasons. 85% of households in the UK use gas boilers for heating their homes while 40% of the country's electricity is produced in power stations run on gas, both of which are higher proportions than other European countries. Houses in the country are also quite poorly insulated and so more energy is required for heating purposes. This heavy reliance on gas means that UK households are the worst impacted in Western Europe, according to the International Monetary Fund. Since households are having to pay a lot more in utility bills, this is impacting the purchasing power of consumers and hence, could result in a lower return on investment which can impact investment opportunities.To control inflation, the Bank of England has kept increasing interest rates in 2022, with nine such increases so far, with the latest one increasing interest rates to 3.5%. This is the highest rate in 14 years, but borrowers have been told that there will likely be further increases in 2023, despite fears that the UK is about to enter a long-drawn recession, if it hasn't already. Higher interest rates mean higher cost of borrowing which in turn can impact return on investment.Last month, the Bank of England warned the UK that it was facing its longer recession in history, ever since records began being maintained over a century ago. The economy also contracted by 0.2% in Q3 2022 which seems to confirm that a recession is imminent rather than likely. According to the British Chambers of Commerce, UK GDP growth forecast for 2022 will be 4.2%, -1.3% in 2023 and 0.7% in 2024, which shows that tough times are likely ahead and 2023 will see a recession.While the immediate outlook of UK's future seems slightly uncertain, it is still home to some of the largest and most influential companies in the world. Several of the 30 most valuable UK companies are known by most people, especially the consumer facing companies. Combined, these companies have a value of almost $2 trillion.

Allergan's acquisition has diversified AbbVie's revenue base into new therapeutic areas, enhancing its long-term growth potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market.

309,6c4faacf-80ac-3747-901d-76cfee996224,UNH,2022-12-29,"With 89% ownership, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-110018241.html,1672311618,STORY,['UNH'],"[If you want to know who really controls UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of UnitedHealth Group. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in UnitedHealth Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see UnitedHealth Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in UnitedHealth Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.9%. With 7.6% and 7.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.7b of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

However, one common metric investors love to put focus on is free cash flow.Still, what is free cash flow?Free cash flow is the total cash a company holds onto after paying for operating costs and capital expenditures.It speaks volumes about a company’s financial health, but in what way?A healthy free cash flow provides more growth opportunities, a higher potential for share buybacks, stable dividend payouts, and the ability to wipe out any debt with ease.Three companies – Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and UnitedHealth Group Inc.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.2%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.86%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 0.26% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 1.13% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.77% in that time.PepsiCo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 9, 2023. In that report, analysts expect PepsiCo to post earnings of $1.64 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 7.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $26.71 billion, up 5.78% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.76 per share and revenue of $85.1 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.99% and +7.08%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. PepsiCo is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that PepsiCo has a Forward P/E ratio of 27.09 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.88, which means PepsiCo is trading at a premium to the group.It is also worth noting that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Beverages - Soft drinks stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 3.22 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47, putting it in the top 19% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

321,546bf096-ad4a-3223-b7d7-23745c46ea0b,PEP,2022-12-29,"PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 72% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-favoured-140019492.html,1672236019,STORY,['PEP'],"[If you want to know who really controls PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PepsiCo. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PepsiCo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PepsiCo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PepsiCo. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PepsiCo, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$385m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in PepsiCo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PepsiCo better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for PepsiCo  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company has successfully expanded labels of its cancer drugs, Imbruvica and Venclexta. It has several new drugs in its portfolio, which have the potential to drive revenues once Humira loses U.S. exclusivity in 2023.Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval of new indications. It has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential. Allergan's acquisition has diversified AbbVie's revenue base into new therapeutic areas, enhancing its long-term growth potential.However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth once Humira generics enter the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvica's sales.

This marked the 17th straight quarter of sales beat.PepsiCo benefits from the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit by delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. It raised its revenue view for 2022.However, PepsiCo witnessed margin pressures in the third quarter driven by impacts of supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs.

Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Oracle have declined -8.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry's decline of -31.0%. The company is spending high on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, and is likely to limit margin expansion. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses to jump 18.3% over fiscal 2022.Nevertheless, Oracle's second-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefitted from strength in infrastructure and applications cloud businesses. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bodes well.Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line.

(NASDAQ:REGN) has fallen by 3.4% over the past week , insiders who sold US$7.0m worth of stock over the past year have had less luck. Insiders would probably have been better off holding on to their shares given that the average selling price of US$620 is still lower than the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, for US$4.3m worth of shares, at about US$622 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$711, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake.In the last year Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, currently worth about US$3.2b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. While conducting our analysis, we found that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Some experts believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and industry, while others are more cautious about its potential impact. The artificial intelligence sector is thriving across the globe. AI-enabled tools, like smarter chat-bots for customer service and robots for self-service at banks, are gaining traction in the mainstream. AI applications are also present in home appliances, phones, hospitals, agriculture, and the military. Globally, AI has been rapidly integrated into corporate processes to improve business operations.  An increase in demand for smart homes and smart cities is expected to propel the artificial intelligence chip market growth going forward. Though 2022 was a rough year for businesses, the stock market tanked, interest rates spiked and many thousands of people lost their jobs, there was exponential growth in the AI industry in 2022 as projects like self-driving cars became immensely popular. By 2030, it is expected that artificial intelligence is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy, representing 26% of the global GDP. According to recent research, the global AI Chip market is expected to grow to $49.26 billion in 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 34.6% from 2021 onwards. Some of the top firms working in AI include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Investors eager to jump on this growth bandwagon should consider carefully the predictions made by top market experts regarding the products of these firms and how they are expected to fare in the future.For example, it is expected that content automation is going be a major theme in the AI market moving forward. AI-capable software has developed the coding required to produce a variety of original content, including images, video, music, audio, and language. Research firm Gartner expects that by 2025, 30% of outbound messages from major enterprises will be synthetically generated.  It is also predicted that more firms will focus on building AI systems for mass production in the coming years.Story continuesRicardo Michel Reyes, a top executive at research platform Erudit, believes that another exciting trend in AI is quantum computing, which has been around for around 7 years but will have applications in the next 25 years or so. Per the expert, quantum computers are even more powerful than supercomputers in solving complex problems. Compared to the progress that traditional computers have made in the past sixty years, it is expected that quantum computers will evolve at an even rapid scale.There are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of AI, such as job displacement and ethical issues related to the use of intelligent systems. Some experts believe that it will be important for society to carefully consider the implications of AI and to establish guidelines for its responsible development and use.There are many experts on artificial intelligence (AI) who come from a variety of backgrounds and fields of study. Some of the key figures in the field of AI include: French computer scientist Yann LeCun, Chinese-American computer scientist Andrew Ng, Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, Chinese-American computer scientist Fei-Fei Li, and German-American computer scientist Sebastian Thrun. You can look for these people's published work to read more about the future of artificial intelligence.Our MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The details of each AI company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. Hedge fund sentiment is also included for further clarity on the money being poured into these firms and the confidence that elite investors have in their success. Please check out our recent articles 15 Biggest AI Companies in the World and 13 Most Advanced Countries in AI on this topic.The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 10 Companies, 10 PredictionsThe Future of Artificial Intelligence: 10 Companies, 10 Predictions10. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67    Related Prediction: Businesses Can Build a Much Brighter Future Where Humans Are Relieved of Menial Work Using AI CapabilitiesOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) offers products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide. Oracle masters in rapidly building, training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. Additionally, broadening access to business applications with chatbots and conversational AI interfaces are a few services offered by Oracle Corp. Andrew Ng, an American computer scientist and technology entrepreneur, has already underscored how businesses can build a much brighter future where humans are relieved of menial work using AI capabilities. On December 14, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman maintained a Market Perform rating on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock and raised the price target to $95 from $90, highlighting that the company maintained a forecast of greater than 30% y/y CC organic Cloud growth in FY23.   Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) with 25.9 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the top AI stocks to buy now according to elite investors.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The sell-off in the enterprise software sector, combined with the complexity related to the acquisition of Cerner, provided an opportunity for us to re-establish a position in Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Oracle is one of the world’s largest and most profitable software companies-generating more than $42 billion in revenue and 40% operating margins. We have always admired the stability of Oracle’s business and the strength of its customer relationships. Now, the company’s organic growth is beginning to accelerate. Specifically, total revenue grew 7% in the fiscal year 2022 and 10% in the fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, management believes that Cerner’s growth and margins can be higher under Oracle’s ownership than they could on a standalone basis. Finally, we commend Oracle’s repurchase of roughly half its share base over the past decade, which has nearly doubled each remaining share’s interest in the business. Trading for only 12x calendar 2023 earnings ex-cash, we believe Oracle’s risk/reward is attractive.”9. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Related Prediction: AI Shows Tremendous Progress in a Very Short Time and Will Grow as The Demand for Hybrid Cloud IncreasesCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) designs, manufactures and sells Internet Protocol-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology industry in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, Japan, and China. Cisco has a range of cloud and network management tools based on AI technology, like Kube Flow and consistent AI. The Kube Flow project is dedicated to making deployments of ML workflows simple, portable, and scalable. The project has also partnered with tech giant Google for cloud services. Debo Dutta, a visiting scholar in Stanford University, has said that the project has made tremendous progress in a very short time and will grow as the demand for hybrid cloud life cycles increases. On December 13, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $52 from $48, noting that estimate revisions are more likely to come late in the first half of 2023 as backlogs clear and the demand picture becomes clearer.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based firm Two Sigma Advisors is a leading shareholder in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) with 9.7 million shares worth more than $388 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Carillon Towers Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded lower as investors weighed how supply chain concerns would impact sales growth. The company has been upgrading its switching and routing offerings, which should lead to strong demand as on-site locations upgrade infrastructure.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69     Related Prediction: Data is The New OilIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of computer products and technologies worldwide. While Intel is not primarily an artificial intelligence (AI) company, it does have a significant presence in the AI market and has made significant investments in AI-related technologies.Intel has developed a number of AI products and solutions, including hardware, software, and services that enable businesses and organizations to build, deploy, and manage AI applications. For example, Intel offers AI-optimized processors, such as its Intel Xeon Scalable processors, which are designed to provide high performance and efficiency for AI workloads. Intel also offers a range of AI software tools and platforms, such as its Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit, which helps developers build and deploy AI applications on a variety of platforms.One of the top AI-related products of the firm is BigDL 2.0, a tool that makes it easier for data scientists and data engineers to build end-to-end, distributed AI applications. Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur in the field of data science, had predicted the use of big data on such a mass scale, even going as far as to say that data is the new oil.On November 22, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh resumed coverage of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock with a Neutral rating and $32 price target, noting that the company has seen increased challenges in both the server and PC markets with server CPU ramps delayed to 2023 and softening PC demand.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.9 billion in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 65 in the preceding quarter worth $2.5 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.”7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74    Related Prediction: Cloud Computing Is Just a Better Way to Run BusinessMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide. A top AI product of the firm is the Micron 9300 NVMe SSD, a drive that meets the demands of performance-critical cloud and data center workloads with the speed, performance and capacity of flagship performers. Marc Benioff, the CEO of software giant Salesforce, has underlined how these devices are critical to businesses, saying recently that cloud computing is just a better way to run your business.On December 7, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained an Overweight rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and lowered the price target to $70 from $75, noting that it would not be surprising to see shares trading lower ahead of the upcoming first-quarter earnings release.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in DRAM and NAND memory production. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89     Related Prediction: Machine Learning Will Increase Productivity Throughout the Supply Chain and Transform AutomationAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. AMD offers AI-focused hardware, including graph inference engines that accelerate machine learning model inferences. The engines, AMD MIGraphX, can be used by installing binaries directly or building from source code. Dave Waters, a top petrological expert and renowned AI expert, had predicted the use of these AI-focused tools in business, saying that machine learning will increase productivity throughout the supply chain and transform automation.On November 15, Credit Suisse analyst Chris Caso assumed coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock with an Outperform rating and $90 price target, noting that the advisory expected further server share gains and cloud market growth.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.99 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), compared to 87 in the previous quarter worth $4.8 billion.In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the top AI stocks to buy now according to elite investors.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology (…read more) Click to continue reading and see The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 5 Companies, 5 Predictions. Suggested Articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy12 Countries That Produce the Best CoffeeDisclosure.

(CSCO) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cisco-systems-140002982.html,1672236002,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned -1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has lost 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 points to a change of +5.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.80 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.44 billion and $56.3 billion estimates indicate +5.6% and +3.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.86 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.32%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
