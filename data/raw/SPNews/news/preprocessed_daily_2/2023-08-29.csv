You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”15. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a major transportation company in the US. The company is primarily known for its railroad operations, but it also offers various logistics and related services.

(NASDAQ:INTU), a provider of software for small business accounting and tax preparation under the QuickBooks and TurboTax brands as well as personal finance (Credit Karma) and marketing services (Mailchimp). We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.82%, as of August 25.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was a popular stock among hedge funds at the end of Q2 2023 as 87 funds owned stakes in the company, growing from 72 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$25m worth of shares, at about US$80.10 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$58.15). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 136.68k shares for US$7.9m. On the other hand they divested 1.27m shares, for US$101m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Charles Schwab than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Charles Schwab Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Charles Schwab. In total, Founder &amp; Co-Chairman Charles Schwab sold US$5.0m worth of shares in that time. On the flip side, insider Charles Ruffel spent US$50k on purchasing shares. Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Charles SchwabI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Charles Schwab insiders own 1.4% of the company, currently worth about US$1.5b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Charles Schwab Insider Transactions Indicate?The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Charles Schwab, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, Charles Schwab makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Charles Schwab has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation's NVDA, BlackRock, Inc. BLK, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. HIVE, and Block, Inc. SQHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:2 Crypto Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Stages a ComebackThe price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading within a narrow range in August as volatility this time around is significantly low due to traders going on holiday until Labor Day.However, the price of Bitcoin lately bounced back from its trough of below $25,500, the lowest level since mid-June, touched last week. It is now holding above the psychological level of $26,000 over the past 24 hours.So, what's behind the Bitcoin rally? Traditionally, the price of Bitcoin is dependent on the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This is because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are considered to be risky assets.Now, NVIDIA Corporation's current blowout earnings have not only lifted the mood among investors to place bets on tech stocks but also given cryptos, including the price of Bitcoin a lift (read more: Nvidia &amp; 2 Other AI Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Soon).The long-dated Treasury yield, meanwhile, has fallen. The 10-year Treasury yield, after hitting its highest level in more than 15 years earlier in the week, declined to 4.18% on Aug 24.Growing concerns about a ""hard landing,"" or in other words, the Federal Reserve not being able to tame inflation without causing an economic slump, has put pressure on bond yield. After all, the Fed's move to curtail inflation has impacted both the manufacturing and services side of the economy adversely. This, in turn, is spurring bets that the central bank will be compelled to remain accommodative.Story continuesThe possibility of a pause in interest rate hikes in the upcoming meetings bodes well for high-risk assets, including digital coins. The CME FedWatch Tool lately shows that around 80.5% of market participants do not anticipate the Fed to raise interest rates in September.Furthermore, interest among financial bigwigs in crypto is likely to push the price of Bitcoin, along with other digital coins, higher shortly. BlackRock, Inc. has appealed to regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, which will increase retail participation. Similarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation is backing a new exchange called EDX Markets.The price of Bitcoin is also dependent on its halving cycles. Bitcoin's halving event is due next year when the supply of the world's numero uno cryptocurrency will be lowered leading to a boost in its price. Thus, astute investors should now keep a tab on companies that can make money by capitalizing on Bitcoin's current upsurge, and growth prospects.Primary among them is the Bitcoin mining firm HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. HIVE Blockchain's shares have soared 138.9% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 16.9% in the same period.HIVE Blockchain's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 72.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE's current-year earnings has increased 39.4% over the past 60 days. HIVE Blockchain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Block, Inc., by the way, has invested significantly in Bitcoin. Per CoinGecko, Block has around $235 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Its Cash App, where users can easily purchase and sell Bitcoin, has seen strong engagement in recent times.Block has made rampant investments in blockchain technologies that empower the presence of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. Block's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year are 68% and 36.3%, respectively. In reality, Block's projected earnings growth rate over the next five-year period is 30%.

Axios Global Tech Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for chipmakers and for the future of U.S. and China relations.Investors and chipmakers should be “mildly encouraged” about communication between the United States and China, Heath says. “The more transparency, the more dialogue, the better for you as a chipmaker,” Heath explains. “U.S. exports to China are still basically at record levels and that also includes for some forms of chips” and the “broad environment is still reasonable encouraging,” Heath notes.Heath says Raimondo ""is extremely well regarded by the White House"" and ""is treated as a serious player by the people she is talking to in Beijing, you know, that’s exactly the right person that you want there having these discussions. It doesn’t guarantee any outcomes in the future, but it gives you a solid basis for having a more functional relationship.”Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is in China this week meeting with senior Chinese officials in an effort to ease tensions. Now, the two sides are reaching an agreement to hold regular discussions about export restrictions and also intellectual property.GINA RAIMONDO: The United States is committed to being transparent about our export control enforcement strategy. I want to be clear, we are not compromising or negotiating in matters of national security, period. But this is meant to be a dialogue where we increase transparency and where we are clear about what we are doing as it relates to export control enforcement. And by the way, to show you how real this is, the first meeting of that new information exchange is tomorrow in Beijing.- Joining us now, we want to bring in Ryan Heath, Axios Global Tech Correspondent. Ryan, it's good to see you here. So we have some of these headlines coming out of China today opening up lines of communication. We know obviously, there's been this tit for tat escalation of tensions between the US and China now for quite some time. How encouraged should US chipmakers be, should investors be about the fact that we are likely going to see more communication between the two sides.Story continuesRYAN HEATH: Mildly encouraged is probably the best description there. If you are a business that has long-range investments, and that's what all chip making and design is about, then you need certainty. So the more transparency, the more dialogue, the better for you as a chip maker.At the same time, while this isn't precisely true for every different type of chip, we need to be clear that US exports to China are still basically at record levels. And that also includes, for some forms of chips. So all of the discussion is around what controls are being put into place, what might not be able to be sold in the future. But the broad environment is still reasonably encouraging. And so it's just worthwhile keeping a bit of that in mind as we work through all of this.- To what extent do you think the Commerce Secretary's meeting visit to China could go far in trying to dial down some of this tension that we have seen escalate from US measures on Export controls, China retaliating in some way. I mean, transparency and dialogue are great. But if you're both dialing up the pressure, how much of that temperature can come down?RYAN HEATH: Yeah, so we're not talking about dialing down the temperature 100 degrees. We're talking, can we dial it down 5 degrees? Can we leave a bit more space for negotiation and discussion in the future?But I do think that sort of mood music is really important. Like, there has been relatively little contact between the administrations for quite a while now. There is tension at the diplomatic level, which is supposed to be the nicest space for discussion.So to have Raimondo there who is an extremely safe pair of hands, who is extremely well regarded by the White House, who is treated as a serious player by the people she is talking to in Beijing, that's exactly the right person that you want there having these discussions. It doesn't guarantee any outcomes in the future, but it gives you a solid basis for having a more functional relationship for knowing there is someone who will pick up the phone if there's a new problem that we can't anticipate right now. And that ultimately is the point of this sort of diplomacy is you want people to pick up your call when it's urgent.- So step in the right direction. But Ryan, what are some of these tough decisions that US chip makers are being forced to make today because yes, while this is maybe slightly encouraging, like, you're saying, there's still so much uncertainty, I should say, given the fact that tensions have remained high for so long? And these chipmakers can exactly wait around to see what the relationship's going to look like in 12 to 18 months.RYAN HEATH: Yeah, exactly. And we're starting to see other effects in the market as well. It's not just about what you can and can't sell to China, it's other countries placing orders in case they become subject to a future export control. They also want to make sure so, for example, if you're in the Middle East and you've got a ton of cash that you can splash out on NVIDIA chips, why not stockpile them and then sell them later to the Chinese?That's creating all sorts of ripple effects in these markets. And those begin with what production lines are you going to run in the US at your new chip factories or what ones are you going to build using all of this new CHIPS Act money that is coming down the pipeline in '23 and '24 due to those global effects and in the sense of which markets are actually going to remain functional export markets into the future. And then further on down the line, if sanctions are coming into place, then you've got to think about whether you get implicated in sanctions depending on how you have set up your contracting. So there are four layers of effects here that all of these companies are having to think through at the moment.]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 5/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 2/104. GF Value rank: 3/105. Momentum rank: 7/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Western Digital Corp the GF Score of 66 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of Western Digital Corp's BusinessWestern Digital Corp, with a market cap of $13.26 billion, is a leading vertically integrated supplier of data storage solutions, spanning both hard disk drives and solid-state drives. In the HDD market, it forms a practical duopoly with Seagate, and it is the largest global producer of NAND flash chips for SSDs in a joint venture with competitor Kioxia. Despite its significant sales of $12.32 billion, the company has an operating margin of -8.87%, indicating potential challenges in profitability.Story continuesWestern Digital Corp (WDC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisWestern Digital Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company has an interest coverage ratio of 0, which positions it worse than 0% of 1604 companies in the Hardware industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.48, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.29 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Western Digital Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -11.6 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 84.54% of 2322 companies in the Hardware industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Western Digital Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Western Digital Corp (WDC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Western Digital Corp has a strong market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future.

Let's delve into the details.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with WDC. Click here to check it out. WDC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WDCWestern Digital is a leading supplier of data storage solutions, offering both hard disk drives and solid-state drives. It has a significant presence in the HDD market, forming a practical duopoly with Seagate. Western Digital is also the largest global producer of NAND flash chips for SSDs, in a joint venture with competitor Kioxia.As of August 28, 2023, Western Digital's stock price stands at $40.79, whereas its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $33.98. This indicates that the stock may be modestly overvalued. The company has a market cap of $13.10 billion and sales of $12.30 billion.Western Digital (WDC): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) appears to be modestly overvalued. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given Western Digital's current price of $40.79 per share and the market cap of $13.10 billion, the stock seems to be modestly overvalued.Story continuesBecause Western Digital is relatively overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Western Digital (WDC): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength, including its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage, before deciding to purchase shares. Western Digital has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.29, which ranks worse than 83.18% of companies in the Hardware industry. The overall financial strength of Western Digital is 5 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Western Digital (WDC): A Closer Look at its Modest OvervaluationProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 0%, which ranks worse than 0% of companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCReturn on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”15. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a major transportation company in the US. The company is primarily known for its railroad operations, but it also offers various logistics and related services.

(NASDAQ:INTU), a provider of software for small business accounting and tax preparation under the QuickBooks and TurboTax brands as well as personal finance (Credit Karma) and marketing services (Mailchimp). We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.82%, as of August 25.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was a popular stock among hedge funds at the end of Q2 2023 as 87 funds owned stakes in the company, growing from 72 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers. The company pays a per-share dividend of $0.25 every quarter and has a dividend yield of 1.72%, as of August 25. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list.As of the close of Q2 2023, 88 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database reported having stakes in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), up from 87 in the preceding quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is our longest held investment and remains a top five position. Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits.

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then check out 5 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks To Invest In. The strategy of wide moat investing has gained a lot of traction over the past few years. This strategy is most commonly attributed to Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett prefers stocks that he believes have a wide economic moat. Moat is competitive advantage that a firm has, and this protects it against competitors in the long term. Firms that are believed to have a moat that protects them for more than 20 years are called wide moat firms while those whose moat protects them for less than 20 years but more than 10 years are called narrow moat stocks. We've covered economic moats and Mr. Buffett's history with this investment strategy in a lot of detail as part of our coverage of 13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Naturally, as opposed to using financial metrics to segregate stocks, separating them based on their economic moats involves a lot of subjectivity. One popular yellow book of wide moat stocks that is relied on these days is Morningstar's economic moat rating. This rating criteria lists five factors that can be classified as an economic moat. These are switching costs, network effects, intangible assets, cost advantage, and efficient scale. Briefly exploring these, switching costs refer to the pain or monetary outflows that a customer might face when choosing a new product, network effects measure the value benefits to existing customers as more people use a product, while efficient scale measures a firm's market and the ability of new competitors to enter and increase the number of companies targeting the same revenue pie.Looking at these criteria, it's also possible to a list of companies with wide economic moats. Take the example of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles. The global electric vehicle market was estimated to be worth $384 billion by 2022 end and is expected to sit at $500 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2030 it is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8% to be worth $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Tesla's 2022 revenue was $81.4 billion, making it represent a large portion of the total industry.Story continuesAnalyzing the firm's economic moat, there are few competitors that offer vehicles that are similar to Tesla's at least in the U.S. Other electric vehicle firms, such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), have higher priced alternatives and other options are either available in limited quantities or offer lower range. When it comes to network effects, the more people that buy a Tesla, the larger the firm's charging network becomes which then increases the areas that the car can travel to. Tesla is also offering its charging infrastructure to other EV companies, which further expands its coverage. In terms of intangible assets, the firm's self driving platform is one of the strongest in the market, and the high costs of setting up manufacturing units and efficiently scaling up production also provide Tesla with a competitive advantage as new entrants often struggle and take years to mass produce vehicles. Of course, Tesla isn't the strongest example of a stock with a wide moat, but it does have some crucial advantages that set it apart from the pack. Morningstar, for its part, believes that Tesla is a narrow moat stock and some of the firms that it classifies as those with wide moats are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Apart from an economic moat, another way one can select stocks is to see if they are overvalued or undervalued. This is done by determining a fair price for the shares and then comparing it with the trading price. If the trading price is lower than the presumed fair value then the shares are undervalued and vice versa. If you're interested in undervalued stocks, then check out 15 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.So what are some undervalued wide moat stocks?

CF is benefiting from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs amid headwinds from lower nitrogen prices.The company’s shares are down 35.1% over a year compared with the 39.2% decline of its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Healthy Nitrogen Demand Bodes WellCF Industries is well-placed to gain from rising global demand for nitrogen fertilizers, driven by significant agricultural demand. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.High levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics are likely to drive the demand for nitrogen in North America. Increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are expected to support urea demand in Brazil. The company also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.The company is also expected to benefit from lower natural gas prices. CF Industries witnessed a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the third quarter.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. It generated operating cash flows of roughly $3.9 billion and a free cash flow of around $2.8 billion in 2022. The company also returned $1.65 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2022. During the first half of 2023, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares for $205 million, which included the purchase of 2 million shares for $130 million in the second quarter.Story continuesWeaker Nitrogen Prices a ConcernCF Industries faces headwinds from lower nitrogen prices. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Higher global supply availability driven by higher global operating rates due to lower global energy costs has resulted in a decline in prices. Lower average selling prices weighed on CF's top line in the second quarter. The weak pricing environment is expected to continue in the third quarter. Lower pricing is expected to hurt the company’s sales and margins. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

15,544398ca-b05b-32ec-b5a4-86c33c451d79,EW,2023-08-29,Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edwards-lifesciences-corporation-nyse-ew-140024418.html,1693231224,STORY,['EW'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Edwards Lifesciences implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 22 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Edwards Lifesciences, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Edwards Lifesciences?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Edwards Lifesciences already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Edwards Lifesciences' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Edwards Lifesciences. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 4.7% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Edwards LifesciencesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$404m worth of shares.

People opting to spend on services such as vacations are also not helping the cause of a discretionary goods retailer like Best Buy.The company said Tuesday it saw sizable sales declines in key departments such as mobile phones, consumer electronics, and appliances. While it called out an improvement in the low end of its full-year EPS guidance versus that several months back, it still trimmed the top end — a nod to possible holiday spending softness.Moreover, its third quarter sales guidance suggests the back-to-school electronics shopping season has started on a slow note.""Consumers remain very deal focused,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told analysts on an earnings call, adding shoppers are more keen on spending on travel at the moment.The earnings rundownNet Sales: -7.2% year over year to $9.58 billion vs. estimates for $9.53 billionSame-Store Sales: -6.2% vs. estimates for -6.4%Domestic Same-Store Sales: -7.1%International Same-Store Sales: -5.4%Gross Profit Margin: 27% vs. 21.5% a year ago and estimates for 22.61%Diluted EPS: -21% year over year to $1.22 vs. estimates for $1.07What else caught our attentionQ2 domestic segment gross profit margins rose to 23.1% from 22% last year.Q2 international segment operating profit margins fell to 2.7% from 3.7% a year ago.Q2 overall operating margins were unchanged year on year at 3.6%.Q2 inventory fell 6.5% from a year ago, slower than the pace of sales.Q2 same-store sales declines in the domestic segment: computing and mobile phones -6.4%; consumer electronics -5.7%; appliances -16%.Q2 same-store sales increases in the domestic segment: entertainment up 9%; services up 7.6%; other up 2.4%.Q2 same-store sales fell in all segments for the international segment, except for a 2.5% increase in entertainment and a 4.6% gain in services.Q3 same-store sales seen as ""slightly better"" than the 6.2% drop in the second quarter.August same-store sales tracking down 6%, per BBY's CFO on earnings call.Q4 (holiday quarter) same-store sales seen -3% to slightly positive.2023 EPS guidance: $6.00 to $6.40 vs. estimates for $6.06 (prior: $5.70 to $6.50)Story continuesWhat competitors said: Q2 general merchandise salesWalmart US same-store sales of general merchandise fell by a low-single digit percentage due to weakness in home goods and apparel.Sam's Club US same-store sales of tech merchandise declined by a low-double digit percentage due to softness in consumer electronics.""After years of stimulus-fueled purchasing, the discretionary dollar is harder for our members to part with, and buying habits are returning toward normal. This has affected sizable general merchandise categories, such as consumer electronics, along with more seasonal categories like patio and outdoor furniture."" -BJ's Wholesale CEO Bob EddyWhat Wall Street is saying post earnings""BBY put up mixed results — (i) 2Q EPS beat led by slightly better than expected SSS and strong GM performance, (ii) full year SSS was lowered with 3Q SSS set below the Street, and (iii) full year EBIT margin/EPS were raised to the high-end of the prior range reflecting 1H margin strength. In our view, the print was largely in-line with market expectations. BBY is executing well on what’s under their control, but the backdrop remains challenging from a demand perspective. We remain concerned the recovery in consumer electronics spending will take longer than BBY’s base case and be choppy, limiting the potential snapback in EBIT margin rate and earnings power. The new concern of credit losses weighing on profitability should be an overhang for BBY shares since it was a material tailwind to EBIT margin rate the past several years. Stay Sell-rated with a $70 target price."" -Citi analyst Steven Zaccone""We walk away encouraged to hear a few categories posted flat y/y unit growth in 2Q, though timing of the forthcoming CE cycle remains difficult to pin down. With '24 poised to see replacements stemming from the first wave of COVID demand, deferral from '23, and recent product innovation, transactions could be positive. Combined with LSD% pricing from innovations, +LSD% comp growth driving slight EBIT% expansion remains our base case.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Always Grow.Markets roared with optimism after Nvidia’s positive results as several warnings calling the AI-led rally a “hype” went on a back foot and recession calls were subdued by bullish cheering. However, there are notable analysts and experts who believe the economy is not out of the woods yet and we can face a recession in late 2023 and 2024. Bears believe we are yet to see the real effects of rising interest rates. They say tech stocks have gone too far when it comes to valuations, beyond justifiable levels. Talking to Bloomberg, Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO), recently said the he believes there could be recession ""running perhaps deep into next year” driven by the problems in the real estate industry, inflation and related market factors.Answering a question about the Federal Reserve’s claim that it has cleared the recession hurdle, Grantham said that the Fed’s record is not impressive in this area and it has never called a recession especially the ones following bubbles. Grantham said that the Fed has taken credit for inflating bubbles and inflating asset prices but they have never taken credit for the disinflationary effects of asset prices breaking. Grantham believes the recession he’s warning about may start in 2023.Recession Delayed not CancelledJeffrey Klingelhofer, co-head of investments and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, voiced similar concerns talking to Bloomberg recently. The analyst said that recession in the US is delayed, not cancelled. He said the economic indicators are reaffirming his expectations and there’s nothing surprising. Loan conditions are tightening, consumer spending is slowing and “sentiment wildly deteriorating.” He said that the world is emerging from a low inflationary environment to a high inflationary environment and that’s why changes are not taking places very quickly and the real effects of inflation and rate hikes are taking time to play out.Story continuesKlingelhofer also pointed to the slowdown in China and its effects on the global markets. He said that China’s growth is slowing and it’s aligned with the rest of the world which is also face serious economic challenges.In this backdrop, wise investors are looking for defensive plays that are expected to grow despite recession risks.Stocks That Will Always GrowPhoto by Tech Daily on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first picked stocks that are market leaders in their industries, enjoying a near monopoly status.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”8.

Results were hurt by muted discretionary spending due to inflation. Its apparel business continues to witness soft demand amid higher promotions.Despite a challenging retail environment, exceptional consumer experience in underserved markets and a strong start to the busy back-to-school season acted as tailwinds.

Meanwhile, the gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 32.8%, driven by lower average product margin stemming from higher promotional activity across footwear and apparel.

Meanwhile, the operating margin contracted 410 bps to 4.3% for the reported quarter.Store operating, selling and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded nearly 200 bps to 21.1% due to lower sales volume stemming from inflation, incentive compensation, medical expenses and data processing costs.Story continuesOther FinancialsAs of Jul 29, Hibbett had $33.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a total stockholders' investment of $397.3 million.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal, and Pras Subramanian examine the impact of retail store closures on downtown San Francisco.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: Nordstrom closing or their flagship location in San Francisco over the weekend. Interesting to see them sort of backing out of this big mall, obviously a trend we've seen. Some pretty wild images to take a look at on your screen right now. But I think what stuck out to me is that it is in San Francisco.And San Francisco downtown right now, it's not like we're just talking about Nordstrom, there's been an exodus in the San Francisco downtown area, overall from retail, overall from just businesses in office spaces. Crime has been a big problem in San Francisco. And then when you think about the retail story and what we've been talking about with theft, you wonder if that's going to play a role in the overall retail sector here.We just have retail earnings the last two weeks. Basically everyone, including Nordstrom talked about theft having a problem. Shrink is having a problem at these stores.If I am a store retail owner and it is that frequent of a problem in different places, when you think about a high crime area like San Francisco, do you just operate less stores in cities where it's a problem? I wonder if that becomes a trend.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's crazy to me that theft is such an issue.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Those images were like JCPenney back in the day when they were closing, right? And now it's actually Nordstrom, a very successful retailer.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Liquidation, yeah.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: San Francisco's-- I mean, that story goes beyond what-- beyond the scope of what we can talk about here. But you heard Elon Musk saying we're not going to leave San Francisco. We're going to stay there. Easy for a business to stay there when you don't really operate a retail operation, where people are coming in, strangers off the street coming in. It's not a security risk situation.Story continuesBut San Francisco, just hopefully they can kind of rebound and get the office workers back in the city, get some sort of crime and drug use control there in that city because right now, Nordstrom, I mean, that's a pretty big retailer that's going to be gone. And sort of graphic by Whole Foods, a couple other retailers are leaving the city. Right.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Really, the number one in their respective industries, right, just leaving the city.JOSH SCHAFER: And it's a trend also beyond San Francisco, too. And you just think about retail, UBS had great research from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond filed for bankruptcy about just the fact that this is going to be a thing that you are going to continue to see Michael Lasser over at UBS estimated 50,000 retail stores are going to close by 2027.50,000 stores, that is a lot of stores when you think about-- we talk a lot about the Amazon effect and what e-commerce has done, well, look that feels like more than just Amazon. That's just not being able to get people in some of these stores too. And maybe just some of these stores, I mean, you specifically think about the Bed Bath story, they just expanded too big in areas. They just had too many Bed Bath stores in too close of an area.And so it's interesting to see now how companies are rethinking that strategy. You don't need to flood the zone necessarily with in-store retail.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And one of the key points that Lasser pointed out was the high operating costs and wages and how much it takes to run a lot of these stores when you have that online presence at the same time. It just feels like there's a lot going against--JOSH SCHAFER: Just ship it to them. Just ship them some stuff. I think Amazon did that well, right? We don't need to run stories. Let's just send people stuff.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I sometimes go to stores. And I ship them after I try them on in stores to my parents' place because I can avoid the taxes in New York.JOSH SCHAFER: OK.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's smart. It's a smart [INAUDIBLE].JOSH SCHAFER: That's a savvy tip only on the ""Round Table.""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Savvy tip. The more you know.]"

Nordstrom closed the doors on its five-story, 312,000-square-foot store Sunday for the last time ever, the latest retailer to capitulate to rising crime and lower foot traffic.The news wasn’t a surprise. Nordstrom announced it planned to shut down the once-vibrant store in May.“The dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully,” Jamie Nordstrom, chief stores officer, wrote in a letter to employees at the time.While Nordstrom was once one of the kings of downtown San Francisco shopping, its final days were anything but glorious. Displays were empty, and areas were sealed off.The company also shut down its Nordstrom Rack on Market Street last month, walking away from the heart of the city.Nordstrom joins a growing contingent of retailers abandoning the area. Office Depot, Old Navy, Saks Off 5th, and Anthropologie have shuttered their downtown locations, and a nearby Whole Foods has also left, citing safety concerns.Nordstrom’s departure has extra ripple effects, though. Westfield, the mall where the closing store is located, announced it would be giving the property back to its lender. That mall has been a fixture on Market Street for over 20 years. Sales at the mall, named San Francisco Centre, came in at $298 million last year, compared with $455 million in 2019, Westfield said when announcing the decision. Foot traffic at the mall was down 42% in that same time period.“A growing number of retailers and businesses are leaving the area due to the unsafe conditions for customers, retailers, and employees, coupled with the fact that these significant issues are preventing an economic recovery of the area,” the mall’s owner said at the time Nordstrom announced the closing.San Francisco has been in the midst of what some call a “doom spiral,” with office buildings and businesses still empty in the post-pandemic landscape. Crime has reached levels high enough to prompt some downtown pharmacies to lock up shampoo, toothpaste, and other toiletries. And armed robbers recently hit a Gucci store in broad daylight.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

(Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)Nordstrom’s San Francisco flagship, which for decades occupied crucial real estate at the San Francisco Centre mall on Market Street, closed its doors Sunday.The last days of the high-end store known for its shoes and its service were grim; ABC7 on a recent visit captured images of empty display cases and stacks of naked mannequins and interviewed an employee — whose worn black sneakers were the only part of him in the shot to protect his identity — speaking darkly about crime in the city’s once-vibrant shopping district.During the store’s last hours on Sunday afternoon, the pattern appeared to break. An employee answering the phone said they were too busy with customers to talk.Read more: Is there a retail exodus in San Francisco? Some say Union Square is 'beating strong'The store’s closing has prompted yet another round of hand-wringing about the future of downtown San Francisco. Since the pandemic sent tech workers home by the thousands, with some never to return, foot traffic in the area has plummeted. Stores have closed in droves. The retail vacancy rate in the city was 6% in the first quarter of 2023, the highest in the city since 2006, according to data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a commercial real estate services firm.In announcing the closure of Nordstrom this spring, Jamie Nordstrom, the company’s chief stores officer, said “the dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.”But critics of San Francisco’s political leaders have jumped on the closure as yet another result of the city’s progressive Democratic leadership.Incidentally, the headquarters of X are just a few blocks west of the now-shuttered Nordstrom, and Chief Executive Elon Musk recently tweeted that he planned to stay. He took a dig at the city in making the announcement, though.“The city is in a doom spiral, with one company after another left or leaving,” he said. “We will not. … San Francisco, beautiful San Francisco, though others forsake you, we will always be your friend.”Story continuesRead more: Elon Musk blocks James Woods on X after the actor criticized his move to end blockingThough San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, has frequently been at odds with Musk in recent months, on this she expressed a similar sentiment.After Nordstrom announced its closure in May, Breed held a news conference in Union Square to announce funding to revitalize some streets in the area.Earlier this month, she also announced that the city was studying the idea of turning the struggling mall that Nordstrom is abandoning into a soccer stadium.“We know we need to combat the issues around crime and public safety and affordability and transportation,"" Breed told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""But I am optimistic about the future, because what we are seeing in San Francisco is something like nothing else before.

Softness in the labor market could encourage the Federal Reserve to slow down interest rate hikes, experts said.A softer greenback makes dollar-denominated oil less expensive for investors holding other currencies, boosting demand.Oil prices added slightly to Tuesday's gains in low volume, post-settlement trade after industry data showed a large decline in U.S. crude oil inventories last week, indicating strong demand. Brent crude was last trading up by 1.3% and WTI rose 1.5% by 5:20 p.m. EDT.U.S. crude stocks dropped by about 11.5 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 25, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters prior to the data had estimated on average a draw of 3.3 million barrels.Official crude stockpile data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due at 1430 GMT on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Hurricane Idalia was forecast to reach Category 3 strength - classified as a major hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (179 kph) - before slamming ashore Florida's Gulf Coast in the early hours of Wednesday, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC).The storm will likely impact fuel distribution systems and hit fuel consumption in the affected regions just ahead of the Labor Day federal holiday on Sept. 4, said Mizuho analyst Robert Yawger.The weather system is not expected to hit major oil producing platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Oil major Chevron Corp evacuated some staff from the region, but production was continuing at Chevron-operated Gulf of Mexico oil and gas facilities.Story continuesWhile Idalia may not pose a major supply risk, it does point to a rising risk of potential future outages in the Gulf of Mexico in what is expected to be a busy hurricane season, Yawger noted.Adding to supply concerns, U.S. oil rig count, an early indicator of future production, declined in August for the ninth month in a row, energy services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday.""Even with the potential for some demand destruction (from hurricane Idalia), the coming crude oil supply squeeze is becoming more painfully obvious,"" said Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn.(Reporting by Shariq Khan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Natalie Grover in London, Emily Chow in Singapore and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Josie Kao, Nick Zieminski and Lincoln Feast.)]"

More than 20 counties in western and Central Florida have already issued evacuation orders.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled up $1.06, or 1.3%, at $81.16. The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 1.8%, after shedding 2.3% the week prior. Before that, it rose for seven weeks in a row in a rally inspired by Saudi-Russian production cuts that lifted WTI by nearly 20%.London-traded Brent settled up $1.07, or 1.3%, at $85.49 per barrel. Brent fell 0.4% last week, adding to the previous week’s 2.3% drop. Before that, the global crude benchmark also rose for seven weeks in a row, rising by a total of 18%.Concerns over slowing growth in China, the world’s largest buyer, have kept crude prices boxed at between $80 and $85 over the past month.Idalia threatens supply disruptionsBut the risk of storms hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast of Mexico could change that, analysts said.“The market is now vulnerable to spikes on the back of surprise outages and hurricane-related issues in the US,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“On the supply side, major producers appear committed to ensuring the market remains tight and prices higher. They had little success earlier in the summer but that is no longer the case.”U.S. oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) evacuated staff from three Gulf of Mexico oil production platforms ahead of the hurricane, wire reports said.Supply concerns were also heightened by a fire at a Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) refinery last week after a chemical leak ignited two giant storage tanks filled with naphtha.Story continuesOn Monday, Marathon said it planned to restart units at the 596,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, the third-largest in the United States.U.S. oil drillers were also cutting the number of rigs actively pulling crude out of the ground, indicating that production could further slow in coming months as the “supply squeeze is becoming more painfully obvious"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.But John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital pointed to the three-year highs in crude production estimated back-to-back over the past three weeks by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“The missing words here are ‘production efficiency’, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the U.S. oil industry,” said Kilduff. “This industry is pretty dexterous when it comes to meeting demand. We will have adequate oil, I believe, despite the storms and that should prevent prices from getting out of hand because of the storms.”U.S. data deluge throughout weekSome traders maintain a somewhat outlook for oil this week ahead of an abundance of economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve at its next decision on U.S. interest rates on Sept. 20.U.S. job openings slowed their most in 2-½ years and consumer confidence plunged as well.A second reading on second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth is due on Wednesday, while readings on personal consumption expenditures inflation - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - are due on Thursday, and August nonfarm payrolls data are expected on Friday.FedChair Jerome Powell on Friday said a week ago that the U.S. central bank may need to raise rates further to cool stubborn inflation, which would potentially hit economic activity in the world’s largest economy, weighing on demand for crude.U.S. oil inventories awaitedMarket participants were also on the lookout Tuesday for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Aug. 25. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.921 million barrels, versus the 6.135M-barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug. 18.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus was for a build of 1.234M over the 1.467M increase in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a climb of 0.045M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.945M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesOil: First real uptick in 2 weeks from Hurricane Idalia threatOil rises 1% on softer dollar, US braces for hurricane hitTexas power grid operator issues energy conservation appeal for Tuesday]"

In fact, Morgan Stanley at Work research shows that 83% of executives who receive equity compensation say financial stress is negatively impacting their work and personal lives.If you’re in that boat, factors like long vesting schedules, complicated tools or a confusing website can make equity compensation easy to overlook or frustrating to try to weave into your financial plans. While many used to see equity compensation as just a nice bonus, it’s especially worthwhile amid today’s uncertainty to view equity more holistically.Equity compensation is a key part of your overall earnings, yet even financial professionals sometimes struggle with these complex instruments. Let’s break down a path that can help you better incorporate equity from your employer into your overall financial path.1. Stay proactive.Take the time to look under the hood of your equity compensation plan each time you review your income, assets and debts. Earmark any equity events coming up in the next the year, such as stock options or RSUs (restricted stock units) that will vest, upcoming employee stock purchase program (ESPP) purchases or stock options set to expire.It's also a good idea to check in on the potential value of your holdings, which is usually based on the current market price multiplied by the amount of share units you are awarded, minus any exercise costs. There may also be commissions and fees due, as well as tax implications — which are always a factor no matter when or how you use your equity compensation. Calculating tax implications can be complicated — for example, stock options, RSUs and ESPPs are taxed differently at conversion (RSUs), exercise (stock options) or sale (all types of holdings). The amount of time you own your share units also affects your tax treatment. A tax adviser can help.Story continuesEvery company’s plan is different, and equity compensation can be complex, so make sure you have the details you need to make informed decisions. Beyond reviewing your plan details and exploring the digital platform on which your equity is administered, reach out to your employer with questions — they likely offer tailored content to help deliver answers, as well as on-call direct support from equity professionals who can provide personalized guidance.2. Goals guide the way.Our State of the Workplace Study 2023 has found that people now see achieving long-term goals as the most important benefit of equity compensation.2 But what are your goals, and how do you actually get there? There is no one right answer, whether it’s kicking off a new business venture, supporting a cause you love, paying down debt or buying a home. Whatever the case, your financial plan should adapt depending on your goals. Be honest with yourself about what you want to be working toward and how your equity awards may be able to help you get there.As you’re accruing company equity, consider your personal level of risk tolerance overall, your time horizon, how liquid you need your investments to be and how large a percentage of your portfolio is made up of your company stock. Depending on your needs, you may want to diversify your investments to balance out risk and reward, particularly if your equity compensation becomes a larger part of your overall financial picture.The bottom line: Be intentional. Defining a strategy for yourself that includes workplace equity awards can be an essential step in building up your personal wealth and reaching financial goals. You may benefit from working with a financial professional who can help you navigate contractual obligations and rules regarding your equity stake, as well as how to effectively tailor your overall investments toward your goals.3. Plan for everything.Consistency is key. Sometimes we aren’t planning or executing our financial strategy as well as we could simply because we are short on time, and equity can start to feel like a double-edged sword: With increased wealth potential comes new obligations and red tape. If you are not a financial professional fluent in tax code, consider seeking out professional assistance.A financial adviser can offer insights around your specific financial situation and help you pull in the right specialists, from insurance to tax and estate attorneys. Connect with your company to find out if you can access workplace financial advisers and equity professionals who really understand the ins and outs of your unique plan and can help you find the right information and resources at the right time. Your equity plan provider and employer may also offer customizable solutions to help you make decisions amid the landscape of insider trading regulations and reporting requirements.Whatever the market conditions or the hurdles you encounter in navigating your equity compensation, don’t leave this powerful benefit on autopilot. Remain mindful of your equity stake with each financial decision you make to take a more active role in owning how your company stake works for you.This material has been prepared for informational and educational purposes only.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this investment bank have returned -9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.3%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.14 indicates a change of +22.4% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.78 billion and $58.52 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the earnings schedule for this week while outlining the expectations for the Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs data.Video Transcript- Earnings season winding down, but we still have a few big names reporting this week as well as some big data releases. Yahoo Finance reporter, Josh Schafer, here with the lowdown. Where does your excitement level at this week?JOSH SCHAFER: Brad, we were just joking about this actually upstairs. I'm pretty excited still. I know it's the end of August, we don't have a lot on the calendar this week. But when you think about the calendar this week, we do still have some key economic data. I did want to start first with earnings though.So we'll start with earnings. Like I said, Brad, a little bit less exciting but some fun stuff here. You got Best Buy on Tuesday, curious to hear-- we hear about retail theft and shrink there, that's been a big trend over the last couple of weeks. And then when you take a look at Wednesday, interested to hear from Salesforce. They've talked a lot about AI in the past, curious if they lean on that again this quarter.And then Brad, one of our favorite companies reports on Thursday. Lululemon, I'm wearing the pants right now. You are not today but some days you are. We're going to see how they've been doing. And I think the interesting thing with Lulu to think about is they normally have a strong high-end consumer. It's sort of like an Apple of retail, if you will. And if you think if Lululemon's consumer is trading down or spending less, I think that will tell us more about the consumer than maybe some of the broader retailers that don't have as direct of a market.But like I said, Brad, the exciting part this week is that economic calendar. When you take a look at what we have from an economic perspective this week, you can see it's pretty packed. And you take a look here, Friday's jobs day. Thursday, PCE inflation. Remember, that's the Fed's preferred inflation target.Story continuesAnd then really, it starts tomorrow when you have those JOLTS job openings. You also have consumer confidence. Member consumer confidence took that big swing up during the summer. We saw in the University of Michigan, which also measures consumer sentiment. That came down in August, so curious what we see from the conference board tomorrow. We're also going to have home prices.But for me, the biggest thing this week is that labor report on Friday. And I want to just zoom in on a couple of the numbers we are looking forward to get you ready to go for this week. So when you take a look at the non-farm payrolls expected this week, you can see 168,000 expected that we added in August, that would actually be down a little bit from what we added in July. An employment rate expected to remain flat at 3.5% with average hourly earnings going up to 4.3%, that would be down a little bit from last quarter. Oh sorry, from last month.So the key things we're looking for here if we're looking for the labor market to slow down a little bit, to keep cooling, you want to see this number around here if not lower. You want to see unemployment actually probably tick up a little bit. We haven't seen unemployment tick up in a couple of months. And average hourly wages, that is something we keep talking about, how much people are making. This is now pacing above inflation. So economists are looking for this number to also come down a little bit. But we have to wait till Friday.- All right, I'm not wearing my Lulu pants today, you're right.

44,ddc7b900-e384-3bed-bbc2-818efd7b4686,CRM,2023-08-29,Should You Invest in Salesforce.com (CRM) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invest-salesforce-com-crm-based-133006966.html,1693229406,STORY,['CRM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.9% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Salesforce.com, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is CRM a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $7.44.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Non-GAAP earnings are expected between $1.89 and $1.90 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8.52 billion, indicating an increase of 10.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.90 per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 59.7%.Salesforce’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.5%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Salesforce Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSalesforce Inc. price-eps-surprise | Salesforce Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSalesforce’s quarterly performance is likely to have benefited from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The customer relationship management (CRM) software provider’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is expected to have boosted its top line in the quarter.The company’s ability to offer integrated solutions for customers’ business problems is likely to have been a key growth driver. The firm’s products, like Trailhead and myTrailhead, are helping companies through their transformation processes and increasing business scale with modern technology.Salesforce’s second-quarter performance may have gained from its focus on building and expanding relationships with leading brands across industries and geographies. Also, significant growth opportunities in the public sector are expected to have been a tailwind in the fiscal second quarter.Additionally, the growing demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cloud-based solutions is anticipated to have aided top-line growth in the second quarter. The company is currently focusing on incorporating generative AI tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals.Story continuesCRM forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Einstein GPT is the world’s first generative AI CRM technology, which delivers AI-created content across sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction at hyperscale. With Einstein GPT, the company will transform customer experience with generative AI.Upping its ante in the space, Salesforce launched its AI Cloud service in June 2023, which the company claims is a one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across CRM’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Also, the acquisitions of Slack, Mobify and Vlocity are anticipated to have aided CRM’s top line during the to-be-reported quarter. Growth across its cloud service offerings — Sales, Service, Platform &amp; Other, Marketing &amp; Commerce and Data — is anticipated to have boosted Salesforce’s subscriptions and supported its revenues.Our second-quarter revenue estimate for Sales, Service, Platform &amp; Other, Marketing &amp; Commerce and Data cloud services is pegged at $1.82 billion, $1.97 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively. We expect the company to report revenues from the Subscription and Support segment of $7.83 billion and the Professional Services division of $680.8 million.However, a decline in software spending by small and medium businesses amid the macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war may have affected Salesforce’s fiscal second-quarter performance. Further, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern, along with forex headwinds.However, the ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the second quarter. The company’s first-quarter non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 10% to 27.6% from 17.6% in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of restructuring initiatives.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Salesforce this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Smith (AOS) Up Nearly 22% YTD: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/o-smith-aos-nearly-22-174100667.html,1693244460,STORY,"['AOS', 'GHM', 'FLS']","[Shares of A. O. Smith Corporation AOS have gained nearly 22% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s 20.2% increase. The upside can be linked primarily to robust demand for commercial and residential water heaters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCatalysts Behind the Price SurgeDespite lower boiler sales, strong demand for commercial and residential water heaters is supporting AOS’ North America segment. The company expects North American water treatment sales to increase 5-7% for 2023.  Higher revenues in the Rest of the World segment (revenues up 6% year over year in the second quarter) due to strong demand for residential and commercial water treatment products in China (sales up 15% year over year in the second quarter) and India (sales grew 15% year over year in the second quarter) are also expected to have driven A. O. Smith’s shares. The company expects China sales to increase 3-5% in 2023, while India sales are anticipated to increase 15%.Amid steady demand for commercial and residential water heaters, A. O. Smith’s improved earnings guidance for 2023 sparks optimism. The company expects adjusted earnings of $3.45-$3.60 for the current year compared with $3.30-$3.50 anticipated earlier. This indicates a year-over-year increase of 12% at the mid-point.Handsome rewards to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks also drove the A. O. Smith stock higher. In the first six months of 2023, the company paid dividends of $90.6 million, up 3.1% year over year. In the same period, AOS repurchased 1.08 million shares for approximately $70 million. For 2023, the company expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $300 million. Approximately 6.8 million shares are yet to be repurchased under the existing share repurchase authorization, which was boosted by an additional 7.5 million shares in January.Will the Uptrend Continue?Improving supply chains and signs of gradual uptick in manufacturing activities augur well for A. O. Smith’s growth. While manufacturing activities remain weak, it is showing subtle signs of improvement as evidenced by the July Supply Management report. The Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index remained in the contraction territory, touching 46.4% last month. However, it increased 0.4 percentage points from the June figure, while new orders rose 1.7 percentage points.Amid a general softness in the economy and lower demand, A. O. Smith has provided a conservative outlook for 2023. The company expects sales to either increase or decrease by up to 2%. It expects residential water heater industry volumes to either remain flat or increase up to 2% year over year. Lower boiler sales in the North America segment may weigh on the company’s performance.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderA. O. Smith sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

LULU, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX, Guess?, Inc. GES and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII.Industry: ApparelLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2140634/5-textile---apparel-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-headwindsPersistent inflationary pressure and supply-chain disruptions have been a concern for several Zacks Textile - Apparel industry players. Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are also hurting many companies in the space. In addition, reduced discretionary spending due to an overall inflationary landscape has been a concern. Nevertheless, brand enhancement techniques, including innovations along with efforts to enhance store and digital operations keep lululemon Athletica Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp., Crocs, Inc., Guess?, Inc. and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. well-positioned.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile - Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running and training, to name a few.Some companies also deal with fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryEscalated Costs: Players in the Textile-apparel space are encountering escalated input cost inflation, persistently weighing on their profits. Companies continue to battle supply-chain hurdles stemming from port congestions, increasing freight prices and wide-scale shortages of materials. Textile-apparel players have been witnessing higher SG&amp;A costs as well. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have spiked SG&amp;A costs. These factors pose threats to companies' margins. Moreover, the impact of lower demand due to inflation, rising interest rates and reduced discretionary spending is a significant concern for the payers.Story continuesInternational Exposure Poses Risks: Due to a vast international presence, the same company  es are exposed to volatile foreign currency movements. Political unrest, like turmoil related to the current geopolitical events and related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could also dent companies' performance.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts and alliances will likely keep supporting textile-apparel players. New product launches are also an essential part of their growth. These companies regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences. Textile-apparel players are focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. Consumers' growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Textile – Apparel industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies.

49,55abd6bc-3ee3-3d6f-80da-4309a96dc2da,NWS,2023-08-29,News (NASDAQ:NWSA) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.10,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/news-nasdaq-nwsa-paying-dividend-100527471.html,1693303527.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[The board of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.10 per share on the 11th of October. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.0%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. View our latest analysis for News News' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Prior to this announcement, News' dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 19% of free cash flows. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 16%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendNews Is Still Building Its Track RecordIt is great to see that News has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. The last annual payment of $0.20 was flat on the annual payment from8 years ago. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.News Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that News has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which News hasn't been doing.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for News that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

As a pharmacist, I know that HIV disproportionately affects gay and bisexual men-they make up 63% of patients, according to the CDC. And as a gay man, I'm empathetic to the challenges and successes my patients experience.I joined the Walgreens family in 2011 as a pharmacy manager at a Duane Reade store in my native New York City. On a visit to my own doctor, I made an appointment to start PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis medication, a highly effective and commonly used medication for preventing HIV. The doctor just gave me a blank look and asked what I was ""prepping"" for.It hit me like a ton of bricks that if a trained medical professional didn't know what PrEP is, then they're not having the right conversations with their patients and they're holding back our community's ability to fight the epidemic. It dawned on me then: I could use my role as a pharmacist to be an advocate for my community.I requested a transfer to a specialty pharmacy (we have more than 300), and it was there that my journey into the world of HIV medicine began. By immersing myself in a new community, I gained experience caring for those vulnerable to HIV. Even as a gay pharmacist living in an urban area, there was so much that I still didn't know about treating HIV.Thankfully I met another pharmacist familiar with HIV, and they became my mentor. They introduced me to the real-life implications of the virus and helped me understand the importance of allyship in the community on a human level. It was such a formative time for me.While I'm a proud New Yorker, I recently made a big life change and moved to a specialty pharmacy in the Chicago area to grow my professional skill set and be closer to the Walgreens headquarters. It's been a great opportunity and I've been working with my current team in Glenview, Illinois, for just over two months.Story continuesA day providing healthcare to the LGBTQ+ communityMy co-workers and I wear many hats in our roles as Walgreens specialty pharmacists. On any given day, we could be working with physicians, physician assistants, nurses, case workers, outside clinical pharmacists, or public aid partners on behalf of our patients.You'll see us on the phone a lot, connecting with patients and other healthcare providers. There are about 50 team members (pharmacy technicians and specialty pharmacists with expertise in myriad disease states) who I get to interact with daily. It's wonderful because as a specialist in HIV medicine, I get to consult with my colleagues in treating the patient more comprehensively.But our work can also be challenging, navigating the healthcare system and providing long-term care for what is a chronic health condition. On any given day, I can also play the roles of ""problem solver,"" ""billing detective"" and ""cheerleader"" in motivating my patients to stick with what can be a complex daily regimen.When people living with HIV and AIDS are discriminated against because of their sexuality, which is not a choice, it affects their self-worth and they lose the motivation to take care of themselves. Many of my patients are unhoused and uninsured because navigating the insurance process is so cumbersome.That's why I try to keep patients motivated by sharing my own experiences as someone in the rainbow community. I want to create a safe space for them to confide in me, knowing that they won't be judged or criticized. Nothing brings me more joy than when a barrier is broken down and a connection is made with another person.After a busy day at work connecting with patients and caregivers who all have unique needs, I head home to relax with my husband, Chris.A lot of my free time centers around my love of food and traveling and connecting with others through food. Since moving here, I've been exploring Chicagoland and all the diverse cuisine. After work, I spend time putting together Instagram reels of all my travel and food adventures!Taking steps on National HIV Testing DayIn 2023, we are at a point where a single, small pill has the ability to keep most people's viral level suppressed (undetectable), which means they can't transmit the virus (untransmissible). Together with simple prevention regimens, we have the tools to end the HIV epidemic. It's a matter of getting the knowledge and tools out there, and that's what this role helps me to do.That's why June 27-National HIV Testing Day-is so important. It's about encouraging people to get tested for HIV, know their status, and find avenues to care and treatment. This year's theme is ""Take the Test &amp; Take the Next Step,"" and it highlights the actionable steps people can take, regardless of their test results.Just as my mentor helped me early in my career, I now mentor others and do my best to pay it forward. I am happy to help someone take their first steps on their healthcare journey or even just talk and connect.My work with the Pride Alliance BRGI'm proud to be involved with Walgreens Boots Alliance's Pride Alliance business resource group (BRG), which has been a source of support for me. Growing up queer was an isolating experience and certainly not an aspect of myself I thought would be present in my professional life. But I've come to understand that I am a whole person and can't compartmentalize my identity. Most people spend more time at work than they do at home, and when I'm at work, the Pride Alliance BRG gives me comfort in knowing I'm supported at my ""home away from home.""Moving to Chicago has allowed me to attend more in-person Pride Alliance BRG events, which has been great to build community. I'm grateful to the Pride Alliance BRG because it advocates for all people to be authentically themselves knowing we are supported by a global organization-one I'm so proud to work for and one that helps me navigate through this journey.Aaron Kim representing Walgreens at OPMAN, or Optimal Management of HIV Disease &amp; Hepatitis Clinical Conference.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.ACCESSWIRE | Article LogoContact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/777619/Meet-Aaron-Kim-HIV-Specialty-Pharmacist-at-Walgreens]"

Yahoo Finance Live monitors the company's stock action year-to-date and how Rite Aid compares to the performance of competitors CVS and Walgreens (WBA).Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Rite Aid shares, they are in focus this morning. They're slipping as the company reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy as it faces several lawsuits over the chain's alleged role in the sale of opioids, according to ""The Wall Street Journal"" here.And, of course, you're taking a look at shares reacting, they are down by about 3.6% now. Of course, just a 3-cent move or a 2-cent move gives you that kind of percentage change here.This has long been kind of an embattled longer term story for Rite Aid, whether you think about the number of locations that they sold off years ago and just to make sure that they could kind of right size their own structure.But then additionally, the heated competition in the PBMs' business right now with CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance really being some of the standard bearers for that, as well as Express Scripts and some other names, of course, over the years.But for the majority of how this has shifted and for some of the drugs themselves that could be more generically manufactured that are now in terms of a distribution have more competition from the likes of Amazon and the acquisition of PillPack, and even into Mark Cuban's Cost Plus.I think that's where it created even more of a headwind for Rite Aid now at the store level too that they still operate. Because if it's just online distribution for a company and Amazon and PillPack, they don't have to worry about necessarily the same type of storefronts, even though they could essentially take PillPack into all those Whole Foods locations as well.All that considered though, it's been a rough go for the past several years here for Rite Aid.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. I mean, you have to wonder why they weren't as nimble as, say, a CVS and having some of these partnerships. We knew that obviously, with a lot of the build up from COVID and people sort of going in to get their shots, we knew that was going to start trailing off.CVS was much more proactive about looking at these partnerships. And then when you factor in this alleged oversupply of opioids that Rite Aid has been accused of, also about more than $3 billion in debt, Rite Aid really just didn't keep up with the market. And even when you go into the stores, some of the inventory, some of the shelves tend to be a little bit emptier.So it seems like, I don't know if there was a mismatch between customer demand and inventory, but Rite Aid just not really able to right its ship at the moment and certainly not able to make some effective partnerships in that space as well.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

The DOT alleges that on 43 flights, American Airlines kept passengers on planes during long delays without giving them the opportunity to exit. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the implications for the airline.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. Well, let's take a look at another trending ticker that we're watching. American Airlines is getting hit with a $4.1 million fine from the US Department of Transportation, saying the airline kept passengers on planes dozens of times without the opportunity to exit during delays.Now, this is the largest fine an airline has faced from the department since the implementation of guidelines for extended ground delays were enforced about 10 years ago.And, Brad, so this is about the amount of time that they keep people sitting on the tarmac, not giving people a chance to deplane. So good news for-- good news for consumers who are perhaps looking for some recourse, missing connecting flights. You have a lot of airline staff who have sort of once they're off the clock, you might have to deplane and get on another plane. A win for the consumer even though the dollar amount doesn't seem super significant.BRAD SMITH: Well, here's what's even more interesting about this. Earlier this year, American Airlines had actually implemented kind of an AI-generated rebooking type of system and add on to their service, where if it looked like you weren't going to make your next flight or your connecting flight, that they would automatically rebook you hoping to kind of cut down on the amount of time that people had to spend in lines trying to rebook through customer service, time spent on phones, and so forth.And so now this enters the larger question of, OK, so how many of the passengers were actually missing flights because not only were they being held on the tarmac or sitting on that flight or the plane and American Airlines keeping them on that flight and them not being able to make that connection, but then on the other side, also having to wait it for a longer period of time to ultimately make their connection because they were automatically rebooked as well.So it's kind of a confluence of both the operation that they had changed up, as well as what is being discovered here today with this $4.1 million fine for the ground delays as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And some of that was offset because some of that about 2.05 million was credited to the airline for some of the compensation that they did already give to some people who did have their flights impacted. But a small number, but it is that warning shot that the regulators are paying attention to this. So potentially we'll see-- might see more action. It might put more of these airlines on notice as well.]"

(NYSE:PM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 80% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-nyse-110039055.html,1693306839,STORY,['PM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Philip Morris International implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 14 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockA look at the shareholders of Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Philip Morris International. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Philip Morris International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Philip Morris International. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 18% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.8% and 6.1% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$232m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, and Google Cloud today announced a new collaboration designed to use generative AI technology to improve workflows on time-consuming tasks, such as clinical documentation, so physicians and nurses can focus more on patient care.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230829429128/en/This expanded work with Google Cloud is part of a strategic partnership announced in 2021 that includes safeguards to protect patient privacy and the security of data. HCA Healthcare’s partnership with Google Cloud, as well as its multi-year implementation of MEDITECH Expanse which began in 2022, are key elements of HCA Healthcare’s work to advance its digital transformation.""We’re on a mission to redesign the way care is delivered, letting clinicians focus on patient care and using technology where it can best support doctors and nurses,"" said Michael J. Schlosser, MD, MBA, FAANS, SVP, Care Transformation and Innovation, HCA Healthcare. ""Generative AI and other new technologies are helping us transform the ways teams interact, create better workflows, and have the right team, at the right time, empowered with the information they need for our patients.""As part of a pilot program that began early this year, approximately 75 emergency room physicians at four HCA Healthcare hospitals started using Google’s AI technology to quickly and more easily document key medical information from conversations during patient visits. It is part of a collaboration among HCA Healthcare, Google Cloud, and Augmedix, a healthcare technology company that specializes in ambient medical documentation. According to a 2022 study in JAMA Internal Medicine, 58% of physicians said time spent on documentation limits the amount of time they can spend with patients.Story continuesPhysicians use an Augmedix app on a hands-free device to create accurate and timely medical notes from clinician-patient conversations. Augmedix's proprietary platform then leverages natural language processing, along with Google Cloud’s generative AI technology and multi-party medical speech-to-text processing, to instantly convert the data into medical notes, which physicians review and finalize before they are transferred in real time to the hospital’s electronic health record (EHR).Experts from HCA Healthcare’s Care Transformation and Innovation team (CT&amp;I), along with the Google Cloud and Augmedix teams, continue to work closely with physicians to refine the solution, and HCA Healthcare plans to expand its use to more hospitals later this year. While the companies are in the process of collecting measurement data, physicians in the pilot program have reported strong overall satisfaction.""HCA Healthcare is a leader in care delivery, and our expanded partnership has the potential to benefit the entire healthcare industry,"" said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. ""Bringing generative AI into solutions that support doctors and nurses can significantly improve their day-to-day experiences and help them focus on what matters most – caring for patients.""Another opportunity HCA Healthcare has targeted for improvement through generative AI is patient handoffs between nurses. Typically, this important process is manual and time-consuming, and often provides varying levels of detail. HCA Healthcare’s CT&amp;I team built a system using one of Google Cloud’s large language models (LLMs) that helps automatically generate handoff reports and is designed to promote continuity, consistency, patient safety, and clinical quality – while saving nurses significant time and maintaining human oversight.Prompts were carefully designed to guide the LLM toward prioritized details, such as medication changes, laboratory results, vital sign fluctuations, patient concerns, and overall response to treatment. HCA Healthcare’s team also shaped the model’s outputs to make them intuitive and easy for nurses to read, comprehend, and act upon. During initial beta testing, HCA Healthcare collected nurse feedback to further refine the tool. Currently, the nurse handoff tool is undergoing continued testing at UCF Lake Nona Hospital. After seeing the prototype, nurses were pleased with the speed, accuracy, and relevance of the draft reports the tool is generating and expressed high interest in putting the tool into practice.Longer term, HCA Healthcare is exploring the use of Google’s medically-tuned Med-PaLM 2 LLM to support caregivers.""Having an LLM tailored for medical questions and content could be beneficial for certain critical use cases,"" said Dr. Schlosser. ""We expect Med-PaLM 2 will be especially useful when we’re asking complex medical questions that are grounded on scientific and medical knowledge, while looking for insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts.""Google Cloud’s approach to data governance and privacy policies are designed for its customers to retain control over their data. In healthcare settings, access and use of patient data is protected through the implementation of Google Cloud’s reliable infrastructure and secure data storage that support HIPAA compliance, along with each customer’s security, privacy controls, and processes. Google Cloud’s responsible approach to generative AI also means customers have access to tools to directly tune large language models and to review model responses for biased or unvalidated content, teaching the model to avoid inappropriate outputs.For more information, check out the Google Cloud blog on A responsible path to generative AI in healthcare.About Google CloudGoogle Cloud accelerates every organization’s ability to digitally transform its business and industry.

77,6a03df82-6d28-39a9-8070-ecd6f35e83e6,PPG,2023-08-29,Here's Why You Should Hold on to CF Industries (CF) for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-cf-industries-124100347.html,1693226460,STORY,"['CF', 'CRS', 'PPG']","[CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF is benefiting from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs amid headwinds from lower nitrogen prices.The company’s shares are down 35.1% over a year compared with the 39.2% decline of its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Healthy Nitrogen Demand Bodes WellCF Industries is well-placed to gain from rising global demand for nitrogen fertilizers, driven by significant agricultural demand. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.High levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics are likely to drive the demand for nitrogen in North America. Increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are expected to support urea demand in Brazil. The company also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.The company is also expected to benefit from lower natural gas prices. CF Industries witnessed a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the third quarter.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. It generated operating cash flows of roughly $3.9 billion and a free cash flow of around $2.8 billion in 2022. The company also returned $1.65 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2022. During the first half of 2023, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares for $205 million, which included the purchase of 2 million shares for $130 million in the second quarter.Story continuesWeaker Nitrogen Prices a ConcernCF Industries faces headwinds from lower nitrogen prices. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Higher global supply availability driven by higher global operating rates due to lower global energy costs has resulted in a decline in prices. Lower average selling prices weighed on CF's top line in the second quarter. The weak pricing environment is expected to continue in the third quarter. Lower pricing is expected to hurt the company’s sales and margins. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

78,3f35fbf4-575c-3662-a7af-be272e98154a,GS,2023-08-29,Possible Bearish Signals With Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Disposing Stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-goldman-sachs-110044380.html,1693306844,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Many The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, John Waldron, sold US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$387 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$326. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. Specifically, Chairman &amp; CEO David Solomon ditched US$5.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$613m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 3, the question arises: is the stock modestly undervalued? This article presents a valuation analysis of Global Payments, providing a deeper insight into its intrinsic value. We invite you to explore the following analysis.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with GPN. Click here to check it out. GPN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GPNGlobal Payments is a leading provider of payment processing and software solutions, focusing on serving small and midsize merchants. The company operates in 30 countries and generates about one fourth of its revenue from outside North America, primarily in Europe and Asia. In 2019, Global Payments merged with Total System Services in an all-stock deal that gave Total System Services shareholders 48% of the combined company's shares. The merger added issuer processing operations.Comparing the stock price and the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, provides a deeper exploration of the company's value. This approach ingeniously integrates financial assessment with essential company details.Unveiling Global Payments (GPN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideGF Value SummaryThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) is estimated to be modestly undervalued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. At its current price of $125.29 per share, Global Payments has a market cap of $32.60 billion and the stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued.Because Global Payments is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Unveiling Global Payments (GPN)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Greta Gerwig, director of Barbie, the live-action movie distributed by Warner Bros., created a modern take on the fantastical world of Mattel’s iconic doll, exceeding $1 billion at the global box office this month. The satirical blockbuster is filled with social commentary that makes you laugh out loud but also leaves you thinking about significant underlying messages—like the need for more gender diversity in corporate boardrooms. There are no women in Gerwig’s fictional version of Mattel’s board, led by a wacky CEO character played by actor Will Ferrell. (Mattel's board in real life does have female directors.)Now, there’s another toy from decades past that’s getting a reboot with hopes of a big ROI. Think ""Care Bear Stare.”“The Target-trained marketing genius who helped move $16 billion in Harry Potter movies and merch has a nascent new project: Reviving Care Bears,” explains a new Fortune piece by my finance colleague Shawn Tully. He delves into how this move represents a new area known as “direct transaction private investments.”Back in 1997, when George Jones was the chief of licensing and retail at Warner Bros., he read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone for the first time and saw the potential for a brand and major success.“Jones and his team heavily championed and launched one of the most lucrative movie-plus-marketing twofers in showbiz history,” Tully writes. “The Wizarding World series—starting with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in 2001—now ranks as the fourth highest-grossing cinematic franchise ever, at nearly $10 billion, and Harry Potter–branded offerings, from clothing to cosmetics to sweets, form a mainstay of Warner Bros.’ $6 billion-a-year consumer products business.”Now through his own firm, Jones is taking out the playbook he used at Warner Bros. to bring back the beloved but modestly sized Care Bears brand.Story continues“On Aug. 24, IVEST—the private equity outfit that Jones cofounded—announced its purchase of Care Bears parent Cloudco Entertainment for $100 million, and now owns the collection of roly-poly, pastel-tinted cuddlies sold in the ‘plush’ sections of Walmart and Target,” Tully writes.“The Cloudco deal fits into IVEST’s game plan of purchasing and recharging middle-market consumer goods manufacturers, licensors, and retailers,” he writes. “It’s a major player in a new area known as ‘direct transaction private investments,’ or ‘directs.’ Instead of following the Blackstone or KKR model of acquiring enterprises that they gather in a large fund of, say, 12 holdings, ‘direct’ sponsors such as IVEST raise money from family offices that then hold the majority of shares. That template appeals to those super-wealthy clans because they can handpick deals one by one instead of owning part of a big pool containing numerous holdings they had no role in choosing.”You can read more here about Jones’ plans for the Care Bears along with how strategies he learned from his time at Target creating a “different big box.”Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

They can be helpful tools for investors, providing a more structured plan and helping to inject positivity surrounding future performance.Of course, stocks don’t straightforwardly reach price targets, as unforeseen circumstances can always influence performance. Overall, the shift in sentiment can be seen as a primary takeaway from these upgrades.And recently, three stocks – Netflix NFLX, Emerson Electric EMR, and Discover Financial Services DFS – have all seen recent upgrades among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each.NetflixLoop Capital upgraded NFLX shares to buy from hold with a new $500 per share price target. The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across several timeframes, as shown below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted somewhat mixed quarterly results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 15% and modestly falling short of revenue expectations. Still, the company easily surpassed Subscriber Adds expectations, the most critical metric for the streaming titan.Netflix’s revenue growth has been remarkable but has slightly cooled in recent quarters, as we can see below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEmerson ElectricJPMorgan recently upgraded EMR shares to Overweight from Neutral with an updated $107 per share price target. Like NFLX, Emerson Electric has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift positively across nearly all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those with a preference for income, EMR shares have that covered; shares currently yield 2.1% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 44% of the company’s earnings. Dividend growth is there, too, with the payout growing by a modest 1.5% annualized over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDiscover Financial ServicesWolfe Research recently upgraded DFS shares to Outperform from Peerperform with a new $104 per share price target.Story continuesValue-focused investors could likely be attracted to DFS shares, further reflected by its Style Score of “A” for Value.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.63% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.62%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.84%.Coming into today, shares of the internet video service had lost 2.29% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Discretionary sector lost 4.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.37%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Netflix as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Netflix to post earnings of $3.48 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 12.26%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.53 billion, up 7.6% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.95 per share and revenue of $33.73 billion, which would represent changes of +20.1% and +6.69%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.69% higher. Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Netflix is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.83. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.32.Story continuesMeanwhile, NFLX's PEG ratio is currently 1.37. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. NFLX's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.54 as of yesterday's close.The Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 164, which puts it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The release date for Dune: Part Two was pushed from November of 2023 to March of 2024. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses the strikes' impact on upcoming content and breaks down the areas where the studios and unions disagree.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the prolonged actors and writers strike continues to shake up the box office. Warner Bros confirmed that its film ""Dune: Part Two"", the sci-fi sequel starring Timothy Shamoley and Zendaya, is pushing back its release date as the strikes linger. For more on this story, we're joined by Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal. So, Allie, Barry Diller says the strikes needed to be settled by September 1st otherwise there won't be many movies for anyone to watch next year. So where do things stand now?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Well, Rachelle, things are still at a standstill at this point. And that's September 1st deadline I do think it's a relevant one. But rather it being a hard and fast line, I think it more so represents if writers are not working on new projects now, we're not going to be getting any new content come the new year. And that's going to drag revenues down across the board. And, you know, for the studio side, I think even compared to where we were a month ago, you're certainly seeing a little more urgency there.They're starting to really worry that that they're not going to have that content to aid subscribers and fuel that revenue growth. But there remains critical areas where the two sides just don't align. Number one being artificial intelligence and the use of AI in entertainment. The writers want to guarantee that studios won't use their scripts to train AI, whereas the studios don't want to set a precedent given how new this technology is and addition to the fact that they're saying they own the scripts. And then separately there are other issues like minimum staffing requirements. Studios are saying that should be up to the discretion of the head writer, and then streaming residuals.Story continuesAnother big sticking point writers want pretty hefty bonuses if their shows and movies do well on these streaming platforms. Seems like that should be the case. However, studios just simply don't have the cash to commit to what they want at this point. So a lot of unknowns, a lot of TBDs. There still seems to be a hefty amount of friction, and that's going to mean more economic losses down the line. Milken is saying that that 4 billion projection of losses, that could balloon to 5 billion. And, you know, we're only in a few months of this strike. If this continues through the end of 2023, it could be devastating. And you're already starting to see the cracks begin to show with that ""Dune"" film delayed from November of this year to March of next year.And if you think about the box office theatrical release schedule, this is one of the most anticipated movies of the fall. Now that's gone. So you have to think that these theater chains, the box office in general, they're going to be strapped for a lot of those new content.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I was looking forward to seeing the sequel. I mean, the first one was a little bit long, but I was looking forward to seeing this. But if we're going to end up with like this drought--ALEXANDRA CANAL: A lot of long movies right now, ""Oppenheimer"".RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. That's true. But I guess we'll see how it all plays out in the fall and beyond. Appreciate that update. Our very own Alexandra Canal, thank you so much.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lululemon (LULU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.58 a share, just three days from its upcoming earnings release on August 31, 2023.Lululemon's Earnings ESP sits at 2.1%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.58 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.53.LULU is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Netflix (NFLX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 17, 2023. NFLX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.51 a share 50 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Netflix is $3.48, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.01%.Story continuesLULU and NFLX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

95,120d3562-2328-3021-9d38-f291dfe5a0ac,TJX,2023-08-29,Momentum Monday: Opportunities Abound in the Stock Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/momentum-monday-opportunities-abound-stock-162400479.html,1693239840,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'TJX', 'RACE']","[Want to start the week ahead of the pack? Check out ‘Momentum Mondays,’ where I cover the leading breakout stocks in the market, summarize the major events of the week ahead, and prepare investors for profitable trading.Bull Moves BuildingLast week in Momentum Monday, I noted that equity indexes were going through one of the sharpest pullbacks in several months, however I thought the volatility would bring dip buying opportunities. So far, the lows have held, and stocks appear to be building a base to trade higher from.Last week’s trading activity was punctuated by the Jackson Hole Economic Summit, which investors were anxiously awaiting all week. On Friday morning, Jerome Powell spoke about monetary policy and did not disappoint market participants.While many commentators noted his hawkish tone, as he remained stern that inflation was still too high, and that further interest rate hikes may be required, he was able to balance his statements by the end of the speech. He stated that the Fed would “proceed cautiously,” and that “doing too much” could do unnecessary harm to the economy. As usual, Powell managed to say a lot without saying too much, allowing for enough reassurance, caution, and open-endedness to mostly soothe market expectations.I think that the market’s ability to hold above last week’s lows was telling, and as important as news can be, the market’s response to news is where the real signal comes from. To me, it looks like stocks are setting up for another leg higher.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewSome Investors Refuse to ParticipateEven after the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 15% YTD and the Nasdaq 100 37.5%, some investors just will not buy stocks. The flow of funds into US equities has been surprisingly slow all year.   According to Morningstar, “U.S. equity fund flows have gotten out of the red (for the month), but they’re hardly raking in assets. After taking in just $5.6 billion in June, they gathered a paltry $1.6 billion in July. For the year to date, U.S. equity funds have shed $71 billion.”Story continuesFurthermore, according to the NAAIM Exposure Index, active fund managers were shaken out of their long equity positions during the pullback in August. They have reduced equity exposure to the lowest levels of the year.All of this I think is quite bullish. It means that any rally that starts to build in stocks is going to be chased very aggressively. Investors should be reassured because the fewer investors involved in the move, the more that will have to buy back shares to chase returns into year end.NAAIMImage Source: NAAIMWeek AheadThere are a few economic releases and earnings reports to keep an eye on this week, although earnings season is definitely winding down.Salesforce is reporting Wednesday after the market closes, while Broadcom does its earnings call Thursday after the close. A few small/mid cap software names will be reporting this week as well, including CrowdStrike, Okta, and MondgoDB.Regarding economic data, on Tuesday, we will get updates on US job openings and consumer confidence. Then on Wednesday, ADP employment and a GDP revision as well as pending home sales.Thursday the more important data will be rolling in, with initial jobless claims and PCE inflation, and on Friday, US nonfarm payrolls, and unemployment rate. The late week’s data will be critical for further gauging what to expect from the Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy.Trade SetupsInterestingly, the Utilities sector has been one of the strongest over the last week. Because I like to watch for relative strength, I immediately went to the Zacks Rank to find some utilities stocks with upward trending earnings revisions.The Zacks #1 Rank didn’t disappoint, and I found one utility stock setting up perfectly for momentum traders. Vistra VST enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and some impressive price strength.Analysts have revised Vistra’s earnings estimates significantly higher, and EPS are projected to grow significantly over the next few quarters, while sales are expected to climb as much as 46% YoY in FY23.After an initial breakout in July, VST has been building bull flags and charging higher. Over the last few weeks, it has formed another bullish chart pattern, and if the price can trade above the $30.50 level, it should send the stock to another all-time high. Alternatively, if VST can’t hold the $29.60 level, the setup is invalidated, and investors may want to look for opportunities elsewhere.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAnother top-ranked stock to watch this week is Ferrari RACE. Ferrari boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, and some incredibly strong growth projections. FY23 sales are forecast to grow 18.5% YoY to $6.35 billion, while earnings are expected to climb 28.4% YoY to $6.88 per share.The technical setup on Ferrari stock is extremely nice as well. RACE has been forming a bull flag over the last seven weeks and looks to be breaking out this morning. If the price can close above the $313 level, it should confirm the breakout and send the stock significantly higher. But, if it reverses immediately, or loses the $307 level it may need more time to set up another trade.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewJust a week and a half ago The TJX Companies TJX, posted a huge earnings beat, along with upward guidance. A trend that has been building is consumers favoring discount retailers as inflation continues to challenge home budget constraints.The TJX Companies has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and has seen analysts almost unanimously upgrade earnings estimates across timeframes. For FY23 earnings are projected to grow 18.7% YoY while sales are expected to increase 7.4% to $53.6 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter gapping higher following its earnings report, TJX is building a bull flag right at its all-time highs. If the price can breakout above the $90 level, it should initiate another rush of buying and send the stock higher. However, if it can’t hold above the $87.90 level of support, the setup is invalid and investors can look for opportunities elsewhere.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewFor the last trade setup, I am going to swing back to a stock I highlighted last week, that continues to form a bullish technical pattern. Enerplus ERF has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and traded sideways, within the consolidation all last week. With these kinds of setups, the tighter the range the better the opportunity.With the WTI oil market looking ready to make another bull run, it may be an opportune time to jump back into energy stocks. If Enerplus can breakout above the $17.05 level, it should initiate a rally. Alternatively, if ERF stock can’t hold above the $16.50 level, investors should remain cautious on the stock.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewBottom LineWith the uncertainty of Jackson Hole now in the past, it looks like the stock market should firm up into year end. This week will be rather important to gauge the buying interest from investors, and if things hold up may signal another big move higher in September.I am definitely leaning towards a bullish move going forward, so investors should keep an eye on the leading stocks as it could be a fun forth quarter of trading.Of course, even the best trading setups can fail, so investors should keep risk management top of mind, and always stick to the trading plan.

Both companies expect to lose their patents in the coming years, but fall under the IRA's rules allowing the drugs to be targeted between nine and 13 years after the patent was first filed.This timeline has been a key point of contention for the drug companies, who argue that at least half the time until the patent expires, which is 20 years after filing, is spent in the research and development process. Still, companies have found ways to extend patent life for years after.The drugs, which were selected from a list of 7,500, are covered under Part D, and account for high Medicare spend in recent years. ""These selected drugs accounted for $50.5 billion in total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs, or about 20%, of total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023,"" HHS said in a statement Tuesday.Story continuesPundits predicted a number of other drugs that could be included based on spend, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, which did not make the list, but still could in subsequent years. The diabetes drug, an injectable that some have started to use for weight loss, has caused a spike in healthcare spend for employers in recent months.The companies will begin a negotiation process in early 2024, and CMS will publish the finalized negotiated rates next September.A Merck logo on a scientist's lab coat in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)More lawsuits expectedMore than a half-dozen lawsuits have already been filed in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected after Tuesday's reveal.The company lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.The Biden Administration has said there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents Medicare from setting drug prices.""For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have made record profits while American families were saddled with record prices and unable to afford life-saving prescription drugs. But thanks to the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, we are closer to reaching President Biden’s goal of increasing availability and lowering prescription drug costs for all Americans,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement Tuesday.Some analysts believe the lawsuits will not be successful in delaying the negotiation process, which is slated to begin in February.Leerink Partners said in an updated note Monday that biopharma manufacturer exposure is immaterial because the estimated profits that could be impacted are a small percentage of global earnings.""But there could be some downward pressure on late-decade consensus expectations for certain products if litigation challenges to CMS’s ability to 'negotiate' fail, and sell-siders adjust US revenue estimates for exposed products,"" Leerink added.And nearly a year after the IRA was first passed, a recent poll shows 83% of Americans still support the idea of negotiating drug prices.Some of these same Americans could be negatively impacted by the move, the industry contends.Companies like AstraZeneca say it has affected how the company invests in research and development, and the lobbying group PhRMA says the costs the government is trying to save will result in restricted access to drugs for seniors covered by Part D. Both entities are suing HHS and CMS.John O'Brien, president and CEO of the National Pharmaceutical Council, said in a statement, ""Many important questions related to patient input, patient access and negotiated formularies, and therapeutic alternatives remain unanswered even as the process begins in earnest. There are also significant unintended consequences that are not yet well understood, such as how this process may create perverse incentives delaying launches, reducing subsequent indications, and chilling evidence generation.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The FTC is concerned Amgen will be able to bundle its products to a couple of Horizon's, giving it an advantage over rivals. It's a notion Amgen rejects. The FTC is pausing its challenge in hopes of reaching a settlement that would allow the deal to close. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks the story down.Video Transcript- The Federal Trade Commission is making it easier for Amgen to acquire Horizon Therapeutics. The FTC is suspending its challenge of Amgen's $28 billion takeover of biopharma company, Horizon Therapeutics. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Anjalee Khemlani has all the details for us. Hey, Anjalee.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Hey, Brad. Happy Monday to you. So I wanted to start off with first of all, of course, this pause from the FTC is good news for Amgen, which is looking to close the deal with Horizon Therapeutics by December, that is staying on track with the original timeline.Now, the FTC has caused their challenge of this $28 billion merger until September 18th. They're also still moving forward with an injunction hearing in September as well, and that's going to take place in Chicago. But the FTC did say in its filing on late Friday that it will consider proper resolution of this matter.Now, what the core of the problem is is that the FTC is worried that with the takeover, Amgen has an opportunity to bundle its products with two in particular of Horizon that would give it sort of a market monopoly and an advantage over potential competitors. Right now, Horizon does have a really strong market for two areas of disease, one including thyroid eye disease. So as an example, that's what they're looking at and that's what the FTC is worried about.Now, Amgen has repeatedly said it cannot because it's slate of products is different than Horizon's and is administered differently, and so that's not a issue. But they did say in a statement following the news that, quote, ""We have been consistent with the Commission, the courts, and the public that we have no reason, ability, or intention to bundle Horizon's Tepezza or Krystexxa with any of our products and will not do so. We would be pleased if our commitment were honored instead of going through a lengthy court process.""Story continuesThat said, they're prepared to go to the courts and defend the acquisition. So that's where things stand right now. And of course, the September dates are soon coming up, so we will see if they reach a potential deal before then.- So Anjalee, I mean, you have to keep in mind other companies probably looking for the outcome here. So how could the FTC's move on Amgen impact other deals?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: There has been speculation that because of the fact that the FTC did initially challenge this deal, it could affect others like Pfizer's acquisition, $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. But there are others who say that because there are different issue altogether, it won't. But it is something still that the health care industry and the biopharma industry in general are watching their concerns. That because of how aggressively the FTC is going after these mergers, that each and every one is something to keep an eye on, to watch what to look out for that the FTC is going after.- All right, Yahoo Finance's own Anjalee khemlani. Thank you so much, Anj, for covering all of that and bringing it to our attention here this morning.]"

Following the news, Horizon’s share price climbed 5.8% during the after-market hours on Aug 25, 2023.According to a Reuters article, Amgen issued a statement following the FTC’s strategic move, stating that AMGN welcomes the opportunity to prove the absence of any unscrupulous intent behind the impending acquisition agreement to the courts. Per Reuters, the agency and Amgen are due to meet in federal court in September to discuss the issue.Horizon, however, withheld any statement on the issue, at this time. Year to date, shares of HZNP have lost 6.2% compared with the industry’s 13.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe would like to remind the investors that the acquisition agreement was announced in December 2022. This acquisition will add Horizon’s portfolio of rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio and is expected to be accretive to the bottom line by 2024.Tepezza is HZNP’s blockbuster drug to treat thyroid eye disease, while Krystexxa is used in adults to help reduce the signs and symptoms of gout that are not controlled by other treatments. Uplizna is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder who are anti-aquaporin-4 antibody positive.Year to date, shares of AMGN have lost 2.4% compared with the industry’s 13.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, in May 2023, the FTC filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt Amgen’s acquisition of Horizon. Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like AMGN could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza and Krystexxa. The agency argued that the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.Story continuesIn response to the above lawsuit, Amgen stated that it was disappointed by the FTC’s decision and does not believe that the merger poses any competitive issues. Horizon also responded to the unforeseen development, stating that the objective of the acquisition deal is to accelerate the availability of important rare disease medicines, with significant unmet needs, to more patients worldwide. HZNP also stated that it has no plans to bundle any of its rare disease medicines, thereby addressing the FTC’s potential concern.Both Amgen and Horizon continue to expect the closing of the acquisition agreement by mid-December 2023.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmgen and Horizon currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.A couple of better-ranked stocks in the pharma/biotech sector are J&amp;J JNJ and Corcept Therapeutics CORT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:13% = US$7.2b ÷ US$54b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13.Does NextEra Energy Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, NextEra Energy has a superior ROE than the average (8.3%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining NextEra Energy's Debt And Its 13% Return On EquityNextEra Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.33. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

The device can respond to patient movements in real time thanks to ECAPs, which directly measure how much neural tissue in the spinal cord is active in response to electrical stimulation.Benefits of Inceptiv SCS SystemThe distance between the spinal cord and the implanted epidural leads can change due to patient movements, which are not considered by fixed-output spinal cord stimulation today. The Inceptiv closed-loop function will enable more optimal and consistent therapy delivery and less manual programming adjustment on the part of the patient. This most recent generation of rechargeable neurostimulators represents a substantial advancement in SCS therapy and a turning point in contemporary neuromodulation.More than 50 years ago, Medtronic invented SCS for pain management and continues to produce innovative breakthroughs that personalize care and enhance patient pain relief. With this permission, a new era of pain management that uses sensing technologies to account for each patient's particular biological signals has officially begun.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global spinal cord stimulation devices market size was valued at $1.83 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 8.7% by 2026.

Expanding features of VMware Tanzu and VMware Aria platforms are expected to have helped the company in attracting new customers.A strong partner base that includes Amazon, IBM and Google Cloud is expected to have benefited VMware’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fiscal second quarter, VMware inked a partnership with AMD, Samsung and members of the RISC-V Keystone community to simplify the development and operations of confidential computing applications.What Our Model UnveilsPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Over the past year, shares of LabCorp have declined 7.6% against the industry’s 14.9% rise.As the severity of the pandemic continues to weaken, Labcorp has been witnessing a significant decline in COVID-19 PCR testing volumes for some quarters. Assuming the softness to grow in this segment, the company predicts an 85%-89% decline in COVID-19 testing revenues in the current year compared with 2022.Meanwhile, Labcorp’s Early Development Research Laboratories business continues to be constrained by non-human primate (NHP)-related supply-chain issues. Although the company expects to resolve the issue by the third quarter, the likelihood of such constraints remains. Added to this, the company’s trend of posting declining margins in the past few quarters is concerning.Labcorp PriceLabcorp PriceLabcorp price | Labcorp QuoteLabcorp derives a huge share of its revenues internationally. It remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. With the recent upward trend observed in the value of the U.S. dollar, further acceleration expected by analysts in this value will cause the company’s revenues to face a tough situation overseas.Added to this, LabCorp faces intense competition from its major competitor, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial laboratories and hospitals.On a positive note, in June 2023, Labcorp completed the planned spin-off of its wholly-owned Clinical Development and Commercialization Services (“CDCS”) business. The resulting spin-off is expected to provide Labcorp with strategic flexibility and an operational focus to pursue specific market opportunities. It will also help the company to run the business with focused capital structures and capital allocation strategies to drive innovation.Story continuesIn its efforts to expand further, Labcorp is focusing more on high-growth opportunity areas such as neurodegenerative, autoimmune and liver disease as well as cell and gene therapy. In addition, the company is investing in innovation and technology that supports diagnostic and drug development testing across disease areas, including cancer, Alzheimer’s and other diseases.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Elevance Health, Inc.

It expects networking revenues to grow roughly 20% on a year-over-year basis.However, moderate enterprise demand for storage adapters is expected to have hurt storage connectivity revenues, which Broadcom expects to grow at a low single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis.Continued adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for access gateways, courtesy of solid demand from homes, enterprises, telecommunication companies and other service providers, is expected to have contributed to revenue growth across the broadband end market in the fiscal third quarter.However, moderate spending by telecommunication companies is expected to have hurt 5G deployments in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model IndicatesPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -3.93% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.84%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.15% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 18.3% from last year. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.45%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 29%, meaning it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.87 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 6.10%.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BK is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Valued on a delivered-duty-paid (DDP) basis, the assessments build on black mass price references launched in April for Europe and Asia, and complement Platts' existing suite of daily battery metals price assessments. Black Mass is a recycled material produced through the collection, dismantling and shredding of used batteries.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoChristopher Davis, Regional Director, Metals Pricing – Americas, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""Not only are these new Platts US Black Mass price assessments the first domestic price offerings of their kind, they'll be published daily. The most important thing to note, though, is they will bring greater transparency and help quantify value for this emerging, opaque and non-standardized battery raw materials market.""Platts has observed growing interest in black mass recycling, which is expected to play an integral role in future battery metals supply. Battery production offcuts or used batteries at end-of-life are collected, dismantled and shredded to produce black mass, from which critical materials including lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese can be extracted. The processing of black mass has become increasingly important as a supplement to virgin-mined material supply, as well as a means of reducing the carbon footprint of the battery supply chain.Anna Crowley, Global Head of Metals Pricing, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said:""We're pleased to be following on our Black Mass offerings launched earlier this year in Asia and Europe, with a Western price offering for the US, further filling out the global battery raw materials supply chain. All our assessments and data are aimed at meeting market participants' growing needs for full-life-cycle battery metals information and additional supply chain insights, as well as facilitating energy transition.""Story continuesWith sustainability and energy transition a growing focus globally, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects recycled battery materials to make up a rapidly increasing share of the battery material supply chain well beyond 2030. The potential availability of recycled materials could account for 30% of nickel, 27% of lithium, and 40% of cobalt demand between 2020 and 2050. Importantly, battery recycling has the potential to 1) be cheaper than its virgin-material equivalents; and 2) create supply in regions that do not have natural resources available and be far less carbon-intensive.Following extensive market research, Platts is focusing its US Black Mass assessments and calculations on nickel-cobalt (Ni-Co) containing material, which includes both battery production scrap and spent lithium-ion batteries. The assessments reflect the percentage value, or payable, of black mass constituents, based on the minimum quality specifications of each key component:  lithium, cobalt and nickel.Platts has also launched a new calculated theoretical Ni-Co black mass price – DDP US in $/mt. The calculation combines Platts daily spot market assessments of Ni-Co key component payables with the underlying Platts or LME pricing basis for lithium, cobalt and nickel, respectively. The assessments are as follows:Platts Nickel-Cobalt (Ni-Co) Black Mass DDP US Lithium payables (Min Li 3%)Platts Nickel-Cobalt (Ni-Co) Black Mass DDP US Cobalt payables (Min Co 5%)Platts Nickel-Cobalt (Ni-Co) Black Mass DDP US Nickel payables (Min Ni 10%)Platts Nickel-Cobalt (Ni-Co) Black Mass DDP US calculated price (Min Li 3%, Co 5%, Ni 10%) $/MTPlatts black mass assessments reflect market information reported to Platts and published throughout the day, including firm bids and offers, transactions and indications, as well as any other data deemed relevant to the assessment process.The full description of the Platts assessments methodology and data prioritization can be found here.The assessments are published on the Platts Nonferrous Metals Alert pages, Platts Metals Daily, Platts Metals Week, Platts Dimensions Pro, Platts Market Center, and in the Platts price database, alongside Platts' full suite of battery metals assessments.Media Contacts: Global/EMEA: Paul Sandell, +44 7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy, + 1917 331 4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan, + 65 68189 7569, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

We will also be looking at some of the major players in this market and the 25 biggest beef producing countries in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Beef Producing Countries in the World.The Beef IndustryAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global beef industry was valued at $332.28 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $421.61 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 4.05% over the forecast period.Region wise, North America currently dominates the beef market. The United States is one of the largest consumers and exporters of beef. Beef is one of the most important staple foods in the country. Beef is also produced in high amounts in the region. Mexico is another leading country in beef exports in this region.Asia Pacific tends to be a high growing region in this market. India is also known to be one of the biggest beef producers. China produces and exports large quantities of beef as well. Imports of beef from the US are also common in East Asia which depicts the high consumption level in the area. This region also comprises developing nations due to which the demand for beef is high and constantly increasing. Japan and South Korea have also been importing beef to fulfill their local demands.The Market LeadersSome significant players in the beef market include Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) and BRF S.A. (NYSE:BRFS).Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is one of the world’s largest processors of beef, chicken and pork. It is also known for exporting large volumes of beef outside the United States. It distributes meat and other processed products through grocery, discount and club stores.On August 7, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) reported earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.15 but missed estimates by $0.11. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $13.14 billion, down 2.63% year over year and fell short of expectations by $493.27 million.Story continuesThe food processing group's profits are struggling and therefore, in an attempt to cut costs and enhance capacity utilization, Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) has been considering selling certain assets. On August 17, Bloomberg reported that the company might be divesting its business in China due to decreasing demand and income levels in the region. Earlier in 2023, the company also announced plans to close four chicken facilities in the US by 2024.Another major beef market player is Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL). It is based in the United States and operates in 80 different countries. It provides beef, chicken, pork, packaged and specialty food products. On June 1, the company reported earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.40, beating estimates by $0.01. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $2.98 billion, down 3.84% year over year and short of expectations by $91.45 million. Issues such as supply chain disruption, falling consumer demand due to inflation, and increasing holding costs for inventory led to this decline in quarterly sales.BRF S.A. (NYSE:BRFS), is a leading food processing company that has multiple portfolios, beef being one of them. The company closely monitors its suppliers from which it sources beef products. More than 50 factories of BRF S.A. (NYSE:BRFS) are located in eight countries namely Argentina, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Thailand, and Turkey. The company has also been focusing on strengthening its position in local markets. On August 2, Reuters reported that BRF S.A. (NYSE:BRFS) has entered into a joint venture with the Saudi Halal Products Development Company, considering the country’s demand for poultry and the halal consumption pattern.What’s Happening in the Industry?Beef has been hitting its near-record high price around the world, affecting all stakeholders, from cattle owners to meat processors to the general consumer. In the United States, these livestock producers are currently facing drought conditions due to which they have reduced their supplies to the market. Since supply has been low, meat processors tend to buy meat at higher prices as well. Customers who get to see these high prices in supermarkets end up resorting to alternatives such as Chicken or Turkey. Another reason for not buying beef is that customers do not get to find the type of beef they are looking for since that beef is subject to a supply constraint and is simply not in the market.On August 26, CTV reported the grim agricultural conditions in the US where cattle farmers have been deprived of enough water and feed for their animals. Beef companies in Canada have justified these all-time high beef prices by concluding that they have to pay a high cost for cattle feed and grains.On August 10, CNN Business reported that beef processors like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) reported an increased price for beef as compared to other products like pork or chicken in July. The high beef prices were also confirmed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Beef and veal prices from June to July went up by 2.4%, with an increase in the price for both uncooked and ground beef.As a potential alternative to beef and meat products, plant-based meat is a comparatively new phenomenon. It refers to products made from plants which could be an alternative to meat. It is made by processing proteins from plants to replicate the original meat taste. Although this kind of meat is a known choice among vegans, it is not everybody’s go-to choice among meat products.On March 17, ArabianBusiness reported a development in this market as the IFFCO Group integrated its first ever plant-based meat factory in Dubai which will be providing plant-based meat full of local Middle Eastern flavors.On August 25, Mena FN reported some concerns regarding plant-based meat. While some people question whether this kind of meat is as nutritious as conventional meat, other conservative buyers do not even consider testing it. Despite these concerns, the plant-based meat market might have a long way to go but still targets products to not just the vegan niche but also the mainstream customers.The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine WarThe Russia-Ukraine war which broke out in 2022 had a detrimental impact on the global beef industry. Ukraine is said to be one of the largest producers of beef and poultry. With cattle farms destroyed by Russia, Ukraine experienced a drastic reduction in its domestic supplies. Exports from Ukraine, which used to be the eighth largest global poultry producer, got restricted and its export market crashed. The markets most hit by this war include Asia, Africa, and EU countries. Thus, the prices went up as the supplies shrank for agricultural products such as beef, poultry, and wheat.Now that we have taken a look at the global beef industry and what's currently happening in the space, let's take a look at the 25 biggest beef producing countries in the world.25 Biggest Beef Producing Countries in the WorldCopyright: andreadonetti / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyIn order to formulate a list of the 25 biggest beef producing countries in the world, we sourced data from the official database of USDA FAS. The United States Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agriculture Service (USDA FAS) publishes statistics for US agriculture and other countries. We accessed the ‘Production, Supply and Distribution’ database and used the customized commodity query from where we selected ‘beef and veal’ as our commodity. Please note that veal is a kind of beef that comes from calves. However, it was really challenging to find data for the European Union. We used the official European Commission’s beef production database to find data for all EU countries. We did not have to do any additional calculations in terms of units as 1 metric ton equals to '1 metric ton carcass weight equivalent'. Thus, the metric used was production quantity, expressed in Metric Tonnes Carcass Weight Equivalent (MT CWE). Carcass Weight Equivalent is the weight of an animal after slaughter and removal of internal organs, head, and skin. The extracted production data is from 2023. Finally, we ranked the countries in ascending order of their production quantities of beef, as follows:25 Biggest Beef Producing Countries in the World25.

The platform can already be availed by the fintech’s clients across Singapore and will gradually be available across Australia and Hong Kong SAR in later 2023.With the latest move, Nuvei customers, who are trading platform operators, can benefit from hassle-free and secure payouts to the users. The Mastercard Send service is empowered to process a wide range of payouts, like business to consumer disbursements or funding transactions between 1.5 billion-plus debit, credit, and prepaid Mastercard cards.As accelerated and safe deposits, as well as payouts, remain the major highlights of a trading platform, since they usually streamline the user experience, the collaboration with Mastercard will enable Nuvei clients to attract new traders and boost revenues.In addition to this, online traders and investors across the Asia Pacific region can seamlessly profit from their investments in a secure manner. The support of Mastercard's best-in-class fraud protection services authenticates the security of the transactions. A trader merely needs to enter their card details and place a request to cash out investments via Mastercard Send to enjoy immediate access to the funds.One of the most significant endeavors to provide greater speed, increased choice and higher security in payments is clearly reflected through the latest move. The Mastercard Send platform remains the preferred choice for merchants, acquirers, governments, consumers and more, and hence, is utilized to conduct digital money transfers for a diversified array of industries in more than 100 markets.Additionally, expanding a region’s access to the usefulness of its platform is likely to boost the customer base of Mastercard across the Asia Pacific region. Increased utilization of the Send service is also likely to fetch higher revenues to the tech giant. A surge in online trading activity in the region, spurred by technological upgradation and the growing integration of trading platforms on smartphones, may have prompted MA to undertake the recent move.Story continuesThe global online trading platform market is anticipated to witness growth from $9.94 billion in 2023 to $15.34 billion by 2030, per a Fortune Business Insights’ report. Considering the volatile nature of the trading market, the facility to provide instant cash out capability to online traders seems to be a time opportune move on the part of Mastercard.Shares of Mastercard have gained 22.3% in a year compared with the industry’s 10.8% growth.

The quarterly results gained from strong consumer spending, specifically across the travel sector, and an enhanced services suite. Significant cross-border volume growth also contributed to the upside. Nevertheless, MA’s performance was partially offset by an escalating operating cost level.Western Union reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 51 cents, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. Its earnings were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, inflation in Argentina and better-than-expected C2C transactions. WU’s Evolve 2025 strategy’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by increased expenses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

127,6a1e47b5-b213-3bbd-9b0b-7195c69f7381,QCOM,2023-08-29,When Should You Buy QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-qcom-110049864.html,1693306849,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Let's talk about the popular QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$132 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$103. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether QUALCOMM's current trading price of US$112 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at QUALCOMM’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Is QUALCOMM Still Cheap?Great news for investors – QUALCOMM is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $160.07, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, QUALCOMM’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will QUALCOMM generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 15% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for QUALCOMM. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since QCOM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QCOM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for QUALCOMM from their most recent forecasts.

Axios Global Tech Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this means for chipmakers and for the future of U.S. and China relations.Investors and chipmakers should be “mildly encouraged” about communication between the United States and China, Heath says. “The more transparency, the more dialogue, the better for you as a chipmaker,” Heath explains. “U.S. exports to China are still basically at record levels and that also includes for some forms of chips” and the “broad environment is still reasonable encouraging,” Heath notes.Heath says Raimondo ""is extremely well regarded by the White House"" and ""is treated as a serious player by the people she is talking to in Beijing, you know, that’s exactly the right person that you want there having these discussions. It doesn’t guarantee any outcomes in the future, but it gives you a solid basis for having a more functional relationship.”Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is in China this week meeting with senior Chinese officials in an effort to ease tensions. Now, the two sides are reaching an agreement to hold regular discussions about export restrictions and also intellectual property.GINA RAIMONDO: The United States is committed to being transparent about our export control enforcement strategy. I want to be clear, we are not compromising or negotiating in matters of national security, period. But this is meant to be a dialogue where we increase transparency and where we are clear about what we are doing as it relates to export control enforcement. And by the way, to show you how real this is, the first meeting of that new information exchange is tomorrow in Beijing.- Joining us now, we want to bring in Ryan Heath, Axios Global Tech Correspondent. Ryan, it's good to see you here. So we have some of these headlines coming out of China today opening up lines of communication. We know obviously, there's been this tit for tat escalation of tensions between the US and China now for quite some time. How encouraged should US chipmakers be, should investors be about the fact that we are likely going to see more communication between the two sides.Story continuesRYAN HEATH: Mildly encouraged is probably the best description there. If you are a business that has long-range investments, and that's what all chip making and design is about, then you need certainty. So the more transparency, the more dialogue, the better for you as a chip maker.At the same time, while this isn't precisely true for every different type of chip, we need to be clear that US exports to China are still basically at record levels. And that also includes, for some forms of chips. So all of the discussion is around what controls are being put into place, what might not be able to be sold in the future. But the broad environment is still reasonably encouraging. And so it's just worthwhile keeping a bit of that in mind as we work through all of this.- To what extent do you think the Commerce Secretary's meeting visit to China could go far in trying to dial down some of this tension that we have seen escalate from US measures on Export controls, China retaliating in some way. I mean, transparency and dialogue are great. But if you're both dialing up the pressure, how much of that temperature can come down?RYAN HEATH: Yeah, so we're not talking about dialing down the temperature 100 degrees. We're talking, can we dial it down 5 degrees? Can we leave a bit more space for negotiation and discussion in the future?But I do think that sort of mood music is really important. Like, there has been relatively little contact between the administrations for quite a while now. There is tension at the diplomatic level, which is supposed to be the nicest space for discussion.So to have Raimondo there who is an extremely safe pair of hands, who is extremely well regarded by the White House, who is treated as a serious player by the people she is talking to in Beijing, that's exactly the right person that you want there having these discussions. It doesn't guarantee any outcomes in the future, but it gives you a solid basis for having a more functional relationship for knowing there is someone who will pick up the phone if there's a new problem that we can't anticipate right now. And that ultimately is the point of this sort of diplomacy is you want people to pick up your call when it's urgent.- So step in the right direction. But Ryan, what are some of these tough decisions that US chip makers are being forced to make today because yes, while this is maybe slightly encouraging, like, you're saying, there's still so much uncertainty, I should say, given the fact that tensions have remained high for so long? And these chipmakers can exactly wait around to see what the relationship's going to look like in 12 to 18 months.RYAN HEATH: Yeah, exactly. And we're starting to see other effects in the market as well. It's not just about what you can and can't sell to China, it's other countries placing orders in case they become subject to a future export control. They also want to make sure so, for example, if you're in the Middle East and you've got a ton of cash that you can splash out on NVIDIA chips, why not stockpile them and then sell them later to the Chinese?That's creating all sorts of ripple effects in these markets. And those begin with what production lines are you going to run in the US at your new chip factories or what ones are you going to build using all of this new CHIPS Act money that is coming down the pipeline in '23 and '24 due to those global effects and in the sense of which markets are actually going to remain functional export markets into the future. And then further on down the line, if sanctions are coming into place, then you've got to think about whether you get implicated in sanctions depending on how you have set up your contracting. So there are four layers of effects here that all of these companies are having to think through at the moment.]"

134,bedac7bd-0ba3-3c81-94b1-f4652e7c3383,PHM,2023-08-29,PulteGroup (PHM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-considered-good-investment-133006283.html,1693229406,STORY,['PHM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 9.1% over the past month to $11.62.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.

Both companies expect to lose their patents in the coming years, but fall under the IRA's rules allowing the drugs to be targeted between nine and 13 years after the patent was first filed.This timeline has been a key point of contention for the drug companies, who argue that at least half the time until the patent expires, which is 20 years after filing, is spent in the research and development process. Still, companies have found ways to extend patent life for years after.The drugs, which were selected from a list of 7,500, are covered under Part D, and account for high Medicare spend in recent years. ""These selected drugs accounted for $50.5 billion in total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs, or about 20%, of total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023,"" HHS said in a statement Tuesday.Story continuesPundits predicted a number of other drugs that could be included based on spend, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, which did not make the list, but still could in subsequent years. The diabetes drug, an injectable that some have started to use for weight loss, has caused a spike in healthcare spend for employers in recent months.The companies will begin a negotiation process in early 2024, and CMS will publish the finalized negotiated rates next September.A Merck logo on a scientist's lab coat in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)More lawsuits expectedMore than a half-dozen lawsuits have already been filed in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected after Tuesday's reveal.The company lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.The Biden Administration has said there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents Medicare from setting drug prices.""For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have made record profits while American families were saddled with record prices and unable to afford life-saving prescription drugs. But thanks to the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, we are closer to reaching President Biden’s goal of increasing availability and lowering prescription drug costs for all Americans,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement Tuesday.Some analysts believe the lawsuits will not be successful in delaying the negotiation process, which is slated to begin in February.Leerink Partners said in an updated note Monday that biopharma manufacturer exposure is immaterial because the estimated profits that could be impacted are a small percentage of global earnings.""But there could be some downward pressure on late-decade consensus expectations for certain products if litigation challenges to CMS’s ability to 'negotiate' fail, and sell-siders adjust US revenue estimates for exposed products,"" Leerink added.And nearly a year after the IRA was first passed, a recent poll shows 83% of Americans still support the idea of negotiating drug prices.Some of these same Americans could be negatively impacted by the move, the industry contends.Companies like AstraZeneca say it has affected how the company invests in research and development, and the lobbying group PhRMA says the costs the government is trying to save will result in restricted access to drugs for seniors covered by Part D.

The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index was up around 0.4%.Tuesday's announcement kicks off the negotiation process for the 10 drugs whose new prices will go into effect in 2026. The program aims to save $25 billion per year on drug prices by 2031.U.S. laws had prohibited Medicare from negotiating pharmaceutical prices as part of its prescription drug program that began about 20 years ago.Story continuesThe U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) spent $50.5 billion between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023 on the 10 drugs, which is the time period used to determine which medicines were eligible for negotiation. That was about 20% of the total cost of drugs in the Medicare prescription drug program known as Part D.Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal said the savings from negotiations on Jardiance, Januvia, AstraZeneca's Farxiga and Novo's Insulin Aspart, which cost the agency about $16.5 billion total, could potentially free up Medicare's budget and make it easier to cover diabetes or obesity drugs.CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE ACCESSNovartis, whose heart failure drug Entresto was among the 10 selected, Eli Lilly and Merck said they believed the price-setting would stifle innovation in the sector and impact quality of care. AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk said they were evaluating next steps.Bristol Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio in an interview said the inclusion of Eliquis would not impact its long-term strategy, particularly as the drug loses patent exclusivity in 2028, two years after the negotiated prices would take effect.Caforio said Medicare enrollees on the drug could see their access restricted because of unintended consequences of the law.""There is no requirement in the law that insurance companies that administer Medicare benefits will actually continue to make these medicines available to patients without hurdles or burdensome cost sharing,"" he said.CMS Director Dr. Meena Seshamani said Medicare plans to use a review process to make sure insurance companies keep clinically appropriate access to negotiated drugs.Competition for J&amp;J's Stelara is expected to hit the U.S. market in 2025, before negotiated prices go into effect, following deals with Amgen, Alvotech and Teva that delayed launches of their near copies, known as biosimilars.Analysts had said the delays put J&amp;J back on track for $57 billion in 2025 pharmaceutical revenue.Bristol Myers, J&amp;J, Merck, AstraZeneca, and Germany-based Boehringer have also sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Medicare agency, in an effort to derail the price-setting process.BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said that while the list includes many big revenue generators, many of them will face competition shortly after or even before 2026, which was expected to lessen their profitability.Two analysts said they expect the negotiated prices to move beyond Medicare and affect commercial markets for these drugs by 2026, when they come into effect.The 10 initial drugs were chosen based on certain criteria set out by Medicare. They must be sold in pharmacies, not have substantial generic competition, and have been on the market for at least nine years - 13 for more complex biotech drugs.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove, Mike Erman, Manas Mishra in Bengaluru and Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Caroline Humer, Bill Berkrot and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

Data from the study showed that patients who received Rybrevant plus chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with those who were treated with chemotherapy alone.Currently, Rybrevant is approved in the United States for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”15.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.82%, as of August 25.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was a popular stock among hedge funds at the end of Q2 2023 as 87 funds owned stakes in the company, growing from 72 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11.

142,0fdd4a5f-14f6-331a-969c-259e2c1fc078,MDT,2023-08-29,Medtronic's (MDT) Inceptiv Spinal Cord Stimulator Gets CE Mark,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronics-mdt-inceptiv-spinal-cord-150700737.html,1693235220,STORY,"['MDT', 'ITGR', 'ELV', 'PDCO']","[Medtronic plc MDT recently received CE Mark approval for its Inceptiv closed-loop rechargeable spinal cord stimulator (SCS).  The Inceptiv SCS system won't be sold or distributed in the United States but will be commercially available in Europe in the upcoming months.The latest approval will fortify Medtronic’s Neuromodulation business, part of the Neuroscience Portfolio.More on Inceptiv SCS SystemInceptiv SCS System is the first Medtronic SCS device to offer a closed-loop feature that senses each person's unique biological signals and adjusts stimulation moment to moment to keep therapy in sync with the motions of daily life.The Inceptiv device uses a closed-loop ECAP (Evoked Compound Action Potential) capacity, the result of years of research and development by Medtronic, to provide the ability to hear and react to signals throughout the spinal cord. The device can respond to patient movements in real time thanks to ECAPs, which directly measure how much neural tissue in the spinal cord is active in response to electrical stimulation.Benefits of Inceptiv SCS SystemThe distance between the spinal cord and the implanted epidural leads can change due to patient movements, which are not considered by fixed-output spinal cord stimulation today. The Inceptiv closed-loop function will enable more optimal and consistent therapy delivery and less manual programming adjustment on the part of the patient. This most recent generation of rechargeable neurostimulators represents a substantial advancement in SCS therapy and a turning point in contemporary neuromodulation.More than 50 years ago, Medtronic invented SCS for pain management and continues to produce innovative breakthroughs that personalize care and enhance patient pain relief. With this permission, a new era of pain management that uses sensing technologies to account for each patient's particular biological signals has officially begun.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global spinal cord stimulation devices market size was valued at $1.83 billion in 2018 and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 8.7% by 2026. The rise in the number of patients suffering from failed back syndrome, chronic pain, and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is the key factor boosting the market growth.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsIn June 2023, Medtronic presented a robust collection of new clinical and real-world data on its MiniMed 780G insulin pump system. The results were demonstrated at the 83rd American Diabetes Association (“ADA”) Scientific Sessions in San Diego, CA.The latest data sets showed that the proprietary Meal Detection technology of MiniMed 780G supported Time in Range outcomes, which exceeded consensus guidelines of 70%.

Both companies expect to lose their patents in the coming years, but fall under the IRA's rules allowing the drugs to be targeted between nine and 13 years after the patent was first filed.This timeline has been a key point of contention for the drug companies, who argue that at least half the time until the patent expires, which is 20 years after filing, is spent in the research and development process. Still, companies have found ways to extend patent life for years after.The drugs, which were selected from a list of 7,500, are covered under Part D, and account for high Medicare spend in recent years. ""These selected drugs accounted for $50.5 billion in total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs, or about 20%, of total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023,"" HHS said in a statement Tuesday.Story continuesPundits predicted a number of other drugs that could be included based on spend, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, which did not make the list, but still could in subsequent years. The diabetes drug, an injectable that some have started to use for weight loss, has caused a spike in healthcare spend for employers in recent months.The companies will begin a negotiation process in early 2024, and CMS will publish the finalized negotiated rates next September.A Merck logo on a scientist's lab coat in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)More lawsuits expectedMore than a half-dozen lawsuits have already been filed in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected after Tuesday's reveal.The company lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.The Biden Administration has said there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents Medicare from setting drug prices.""For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have made record profits while American families were saddled with record prices and unable to afford life-saving prescription drugs. But thanks to the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, we are closer to reaching President Biden’s goal of increasing availability and lowering prescription drug costs for all Americans,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement Tuesday.Some analysts believe the lawsuits will not be successful in delaying the negotiation process, which is slated to begin in February.Leerink Partners said in an updated note Monday that biopharma manufacturer exposure is immaterial because the estimated profits that could be impacted are a small percentage of global earnings.""But there could be some downward pressure on late-decade consensus expectations for certain products if litigation challenges to CMS’s ability to 'negotiate' fail, and sell-siders adjust US revenue estimates for exposed products,"" Leerink added.And nearly a year after the IRA was first passed, a recent poll shows 83% of Americans still support the idea of negotiating drug prices.Some of these same Americans could be negatively impacted by the move, the industry contends.Companies like AstraZeneca say it has affected how the company invests in research and development, and the lobbying group PhRMA says the costs the government is trying to save will result in restricted access to drugs for seniors covered by Part D. Both entities are suing HHS and CMS.John O'Brien, president and CEO of the National Pharmaceutical Council, said in a statement, ""Many important questions related to patient input, patient access and negotiated formularies, and therapeutic alternatives remain unanswered even as the process begins in earnest. There are also significant unintended consequences that are not yet well understood, such as how this process may create perverse incentives delaying launches, reducing subsequent indications, and chilling evidence generation.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In the study, KEYTRUDA plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR), compared to trastuzumab and chemotherapy alone in this patient population. In the study, more than 80% of patients had tumors that were PD-L1 positive.There was a trend toward improvement in overall survival (OS), the trial’s other primary endpoint, in the ITT population for patients who received the KEYTRUDA combination versus placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. OS analysis for this trial is ongoing.Results from KEYNOTE-811 will be presented at the upcoming 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Meeting.""Patients in the EU diagnosed with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer face an aggressive disease associated with a poor prognosis, underscoring the need for additional first-line treatment options for these patients,"" said Dr. Scot Ebbinghaus, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""With today’s approval of KEYTRUDA, we’re proud that patients whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined positive score ≥1 and healthcare providers in the EU will have an option that includes immunotherapy for this difficult-to-treat disease.""Story continuesThis approval allows marketing of this KEYTRUDA regimen in all 27 European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Northern Ireland.In May 2021, KEYTRUDA was approved in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in the U.S. This indication was approved by the FDA under accelerated approval based on ORR data from KEYNOTE-811, and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Merck is working with the FDA to update this indication to patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive.Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers and is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in gastric, hepatobiliary, esophageal and colorectal cancers.About KEYNOTE-811KEYNOTE-811 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615326) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The dual primary endpoints are PFS per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 732 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy (investigator’s choice of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin), or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most patients presenting with advanced stage disease. Overall, more than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90% to 95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In Europe, it is estimated that there were approximately 136,000 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 97,000 patient deaths from the disease in 2020. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

A Comprehensive Guide,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-merck-mrk-value-really-154046125.html,1693237246,STORY,"['MRK', 'VALU']","[Merck &amp; Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) has been a focal point for investors, with its stock experiencing a daily loss of 0.32% and a 3-month loss of 1.21%. Despite these figures, the company boasts an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 1.22. The question that arises is, is Merck fairly valued? This article aims to delve into the financials and intrinsic value of Merck, providing a comprehensive analysis for potential investors. Read on to find out more.Company IntroductionMRK 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MRKMerck &amp; Co Inc is a renowned pharmaceutical company that develops products for a variety of therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, and infections. The firm's immuno-oncology platform is a significant contributor to its overall sales. Merck also has a robust vaccine business, with treatments to prevent hepatitis B, pediatric diseases, HPV, and shingles. The company also sells animal health-related drugs. Geographically, just under half of the company's sales are generated in the United States.As of August 28, 2023, Merck's stock price stands at $109.86, which is fairly close to its GF Value of $105.51. The GF Value is an estimation of the stock's fair value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates.Unveiling Merck (MRK)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that gives an overview of a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded.A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.According to our valuation method, Merck (NYSE:MRK) is estimated to be fairly valued. The GF Value suggests that the stock's fair value is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. Given its current price of $109.86 per share, Merck's stock is estimated to be fairly valued.Story continuesAs Merck is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling Merck (MRK)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss for investors. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great ways to gauge this. Merck has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.17, ranking worse than 77.62% of 1050 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The overall financial strength of Merck is 5 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Unveiling Merck (MRK)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term pose less risk to investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Merck has been profitable 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $58.30 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.22. Its operating margin is 10.95%, which ranks better than 65.41% of 1035 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Overall, the profitability of Merck is ranked 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Merck is 15.4%, which ranks better than 77.72% of 911 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 23.9%, which ranks better than 71.7% of 887 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way to assess the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the return on invested capital should be higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, Merck's return on invested capital is 4.81, and its cost of capital is 6.28.Unveiling Merck (MRK)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock is estimated to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 71.7% of 887 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

Though a statistically significant improvement in two primary endpoints, PFS and ORR was observed in the Keytruda plus Lenvima arm in the first analysis, in the second analysis, the Keytruda/Lenvima combination failed to demonstrate an improvement in OS compared with Keytruda plus placebo. Meanwhile, the chances of reaching the protocol-specified threshold for statistical significance for OS was low. With the study failing to show an overall survival benefit for patients., Merck and Eisai have decided to close the study.In HNSCC, another study called LEAP-009 is ongoing, which is evaluating Keytruda plus Lenvima versus chemotherapy for treating recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who progressed after platinum therapy and immunotherapy.Merck’s stock has declined 0.7% so far this year against an increase of 7.6% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAt present, Keytruda plus Lenvima is approved in the United States, the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvima is being studied in combination with Keytruda for several different tumor types.We remind investors that in April, Merck and Eisai discontinued another phase III study called LEAP-003 evaluating a combination of Keytruda and Lenvima for the first-line treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Per DMC’s recommendation, Keytruda plus Lenvima did not demonstrate an improvement in OS, one of the study’s dual primary endpoints, versus Keytruda alone.Story continuesBack then, Merck and Eisai also announced that the phase III LEAP-017 study, evaluating Keytruda plus Lenvima for the treatment of patients with unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint of OS.In another press release, Merck announced that a comprehensive phase III program called CORALreef has been initiated on MK-0616, its oral PCSK9 inhibitor being developed for treating hypercholesterolemia. Enrollment has begun in two registrational phase III studies (CORALreef Lipids and CORALreef HeFH) evaluating reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” cholesterol.It plans to begin another phase III cardiovascular outcomes study, CORALreef Outcomes, by the end of 2023. The CORALreef program is expected to enroll approximately 17,000 participants across three global studies. We remind investors that MK-0616 has shown statistically significant LDL cholesterol-lowering activity in a phase II study across a broad spectrum of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has the potential to be developed as a once-daily oral pill, which targets PCSK9 for LDL cholesterol lowering. At present there are no oral PCSK9 inhibitors available in the market.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMerck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Price and ConsensusMerck &amp; Co., Inc.

As companies seek greater productivity, automating undesirable tasks will continue to happen, and AI and machine learning will help us get there. Recently, machine learning mainly involved predictive models classifying data for forecasts, with limited corporate spending. The Nasdaq surged 31% in 2023 due to generative buzz around AI and automation stocks, which lead companies to initiate pilot programs.Here are three of the best automation stocks that walk the line between AI and automation that investors should consider.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a robust player in industrial automation, with a 12.02% year-to-date increase in 2023. Its recent earnings report shows a remarkable 457% year-over-year net income increase and 25.8% revenue growth. This makes Rockwell an attractive robotics stock for those pursuing innovation and profits.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe firm’s remarkable global expansion is noteworthy. Q2 2023 witnessed a 25.5% year-over-year growth in Asia Pacific sales, boosting non-North American revenues. Additionally, Q1 2023 revealed a $156 million free cash flow, indicative of a promising growth trend likely to continue.As we enter the latter part of the year, consider Rockwell’s dominance.

(NYSE:HON) is a diversified conglomerate with a strong presence in the aerospace and defense sectors. It’s also a significant player in quantum computing, employing trapped-ion technology similar to IonQ (NYSE:IONQ). Honeywell’s merger with Cambridge Quantum positions it for a comprehensive quantum business.Moreover, the company has significant potential, particularly in the building technologies sector, with IoT opportunities for future growth. Despite recent slower growth, Honeywell’s expected improvement in revenue growth and earnings in 2023 and 2024 makes it a promising stock to consider.Story continuesThe company also exhibited $35.4 billion revenue in 2022, a modest 3% year-over-year growth. It offers a prudent option for investors seeking stability, backed by its foray into quantum computing through strategic partnerships, which could boost its financial performance.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) faced pandemic-related setbacks with reduced procedures, particularly in Asia. Despite ongoing challenges, the company is rebounding with a 22% global procedure volume increase in Q2 and a 13% rise in installed Da Vinci systems to 8,402.In Q2 2023, Baron Health Care Fund (MUTF:BHCFX) highlighted Intuitive Surgical for its strong performance, particularly due to the success of its da Vinci Surgical System. The system saw a 26% increase in procedures, surpassing expectations. The company’s potential for future expansion in robotic surgery remains significant.Intuitive Surgical’s robust financials, marked by high margins and substantial cash generation, make it a favorable investment.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

160,44473321-3352-3985-8870-f7adadc54f78,PWR,2023-08-29,Lennar and Quanta Services are part of Zacks Earnings Preview,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lennar-quanta-services-part-zacks-114400371.html,1693223040,STORY,"['PWR', '^GSPC', 'LEN-B']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 28, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Lennar LEN and Quanta Services PWR.Breaking Down the Construction &amp; Housing Earnings PictureThe housing and construction space is one of the economy's most interest-rate-sensitive areas. Unsurprisingly, the Fed's extraordinary tightening cycle has been impacting the sector's earnings picture.Earnings for the Zacks Construction sector are expected to be down -11.7% this year, with current earnings expectations for even next year (2024) -4.3% below the 2022 level.Given this seemingly strained profitability picture, how do we account for the Zacks Construction sector stocks' recent performance?The year-to-date performance for the S&amp;P 500 index (+15.2%), homebuilderLennar (up +26.1%), the Zacks Construction sector (+27.6%), and Quanta Services (up +44.5%).Regular readers of our earnings commentary know earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index, as well as for the constituent sectors, peaked in April last year and fell sharply afterward. Estimates kept coming down through April 2023 and have meaningfully stabilized in the aggregate for the index. In fact, estimates have started going up for several sectors, including Construction, since then.The bottom line here is that interest rates are key to the Construction sector's profitability and outlook; the market sized-up the impact of the new policy regime earlier this year and has largely stuck to that somewhat benign outcome (also referred to as 'soft landing') ever since.The more recent stock market weakness in the group likely reflects the so-called 'higher-for-longer' monetary policy outlook that has been taking hold lately.As long as the Fed outlook and the economic outcome expectations don't change meaningfully, one can reasonably expect the Construction sector stocks' performance momentum this year to largely remain in place.Story continuesQ2 Earnings Scorecard (As of Friday, August 25th)The Q2 reporting cycle is effectively over now, with results from 486 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.2% of the index's total membership, already out.We have over 100 companies reporting results this week, including 12 S&amp;P 500 members. Broadcom, Best Buy, Lululemon, and Salesforce are among this week's notable companies reporting results.For the 486 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported already, total Q2 earnings are down -7.4% from the same period last year on +1.05% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.8% beating revenue estimates.Please note that earnings growth for the index would be -1.1% instead of -7.4% once the Energy sector's drag is excluded from the results.The comparison charts nevertheless put the Q2 results from these 486 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.The Earnings Big Picture Please note that the -7.2% decline for Q2 earnings on +1% higher revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.As you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -1% on +4.8% higher revenues.2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressures expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Earnings Remain Stable: No 'Cliff' in Sight  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This is because these companies are usually reinvesting back in the business in order to grow. As the companies mature and profits become more stable, distributing dividends can be a method with which to reward shareholders.Dividends can help an investor to create a steady stream of income, but can also be a sign the company is in excellent financial shape. Financially strong companies are often favored by investors as they can prosper in good times and perform better during periods of economic adversity. Therefore, they have the potential to produce better returns for their shareholders over long periods of time.Criteria for tech companies paying dividendsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CSCO. Click here to check it out. CSCO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CSCOThis discussion will examine two technology names that meet the following criteria:Have a financial strength rating of at least 8 out of 10 from GuruFocus.Trade at or below their GF Value.Yield at least 2.5%.Have a GF Score of at least 85 out of 100.Overview of Cisco SystemsFirst up is Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), a leading provider of routers and switches used to connect networks around the world through the internet. It is estimated that the vast majority of the data transmitted over the internet has been through the companys products over the last three decades. Cisco generates approximately $57 billion in annual revenue and has a market capitalization of more than $228 billion.Cisco Systems receives an 8 out of 10 for financial strength from GuruFocus.Financial strength and dividend growthCisco generally rates very well against its peer group in most areas. Its best showing is on debt-to-Ebitda, which tops 76% of companies in the hardware industry. Debt-to-equity is also easily ahead of most of its competitors. The company benefits from a massive cash position on its balance sheet, $26 billion as of the most recent quarterly report, which gives it one of the better cash-to-debt ratios in the industry and provides interest coverage that comes in ahead of two-thirds of its peer group.Story continuesWhere Cisco does struggle is the equity-to-asset ratio, which is below 69% of the companys peer group. That said, the company's other rankings are also near the high end of its 10-year history. This shows that not only is Cisco outperforming its competition, it is performing at decade highs for the company.The Piotroski F-Score, which measures financial strength, is an 8 out of 9 and the companys Altman Z-Score, which measures the chances a company could go bankrupt, is considered safe. Additionally, Cisco is especially good at generating returns on invested capital as the ROIC is 15.9%. This is above the companys weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.Having a strong financial position, along with an enviable cash balance, has allowed Cisco to raise its dividend for 13 consecutive years. This is one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the tech sector. The expected payout ratio for this fiscal year is just 39%. Shares yield 2.8%, well above the average yield of 1.6% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.GF Score and valuationAn impressive showing on financial strength, along with excellent scores for profitability, momentum and growth, offset by a low score on value, have resulted in a GF Score of 88 out 100 for Cisco Systems. This implies the company could see higher returns moving forward based on GuruFocus research.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsShares of Cisco Systems trade very close to its GF Value. The stock trades at $56 presently, slightly ahead of its GF Value of $54.95. With a price-to-GF Value ratio of 1.02, it receives a rating of fairly valued from GuruFocus.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsOverview of Skyworks SolutionsThe second technology stock to consider is Skyworks Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), which is a semiconductor company that creates, develops and sells its products around the world. The companys products are used in a variety of end markets, such as automotive, smartphones, defense and the connected home. The company has annual sales approaching $5 billion and is valued at nearly $17 billion today.Skyworks Solutions also receives an 8 out of 10 rating for financial strength.Financial strength and dividend growthAdmittedly, the company does not rank as high against the competition as Cisco Systems does. Skyworks Solutions best metric is the equity-to-asset ratio, where it is ranked higher than 60% of companies in the semiconductor industry. On the reverse side, the cash-to-debt score is lower than 80% of its peer group. This has occurred as the company has greatly increased the presence of debt on its balance sheet in recent years. The companys ratios for debt-to-equity, debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage are all middle of the pack.These scores should begin to improve as Skyworks Solutions' cash flows continue to grow. For example, the most recent quarter saw a record year-to-date operating cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. The company ended the third quarter with $722 million in cash, which was used aggressively to pay down its debt by $500 million during the period.As cash flow generation has improved, so too has Skyworks Solutions ability to pay and raise its dividend. Shareholders have received a dividend increase for 10 consecutive years. Dividend increases are likely to continue as the expected payout ratio for fiscal year 2023 is just 30%. Shares offer a yield of 2.6%.Skyworks Solutions Piotroski F-Score is somewhat lower at 6, but still within a safe range. The companys Altman Z-Score, on the other hand, is near the top of the safe range. The company is also very good at turning invested capital into profits as the ROIC of 15.2% is ahead of its WACC of 9.7%. Altogether, these metrics speak to the safety of the companys financial position.GF Score and valuationSkyworks Solutions does not just receive a solid score for financial strength, but in all areas that make up the GF Score ranking. In fact, the company has at least an 8 out of 10 for all five components. This leads to an excellent GF Score of 95 out of 100, implying the potential for outsized returns.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsThe stock trades at a discount to its GF Value by a wide margin at $105. With a GF Value of $135.57, Skyworks Solutions has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.77. Reaching the GF Value would represent a return of 29%. Factor in the dividend and the total return stretches into the low 30% range. The stock is rated as modestly undervalued by GuruFocus.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsFinal thoughtsWhile many companies in the technology sector do not pay dividends, there are names that do. These companies must be on firm financial footing to do so, otherwise their ability to grow and further fund the dividend could be at risk.Cisco Systems and Skyworks Solutions are two companies that have strong financial strength scores that have made it possible for dividends to be distributed to shareholders. Both names have high GF Scores and market-beating yields. While Cisco trades near its GF Value, Skyworks could provide high returns.Investors looking for financially strong tech names paying dividends should consider adding these two stocks to their watchlists.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

The charges were levied on the company for overcharging advisory fees of more than $26.8 million in over 10,900 investment advisory accounts.Some of WFC and its predecessor firms’ financial advisers consented to reduce the standard advisory fees for certain clients. These changes were handwritten or typed on the clients’ investment advisory agreements, thus reflecting the reduced fees. However, the employees in the account processing unit failed to enter the reduced advisory fee rates in the company’s billing systems.Additionally, WFC failed to adopt and implement written compliance with policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and completeness of its billing systems to prevent overbilling of its clients. Hence, WFC and its predecessor firms have been overcharging certain clients for advisory fees who have opened their accounts prior to 2014 through the end of December 2022.To reimburse the overcharging and provide for the appropriate interest charges, Wells Fargo paid approximately $40 million to the distressed accountholders. Further, it has agreed to resolve the issue without accepting or denying the claims on it.Apart from these troubles, Wells Fargo has a long list of pending legal cases and has been facing operational challenges, while remaining under close supervision of the regulatory authorities. It has been slapped with numerous penalties and sanctions including a cap on the asset position by the Federal Reserve.In May 2023, it agreed to pay $1 billion related to a lawsuit accusing the bank of overstating its progress on resolving its 2016 fake account scandal and thereby defrauding shareholders. These are likely to increase expenses in the upcoming period, limiting the company’s bottom-line growth.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 11.8% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 13.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWFC presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Both companies expect to lose their patents in the coming years, but fall under the IRA's rules allowing the drugs to be targeted between nine and 13 years after the patent was first filed.This timeline has been a key point of contention for the drug companies, who argue that at least half the time until the patent expires, which is 20 years after filing, is spent in the research and development process. Still, companies have found ways to extend patent life for years after.The drugs, which were selected from a list of 7,500, are covered under Part D, and account for high Medicare spend in recent years. ""These selected drugs accounted for $50.5 billion in total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs, or about 20%, of total Part D gross covered prescription drug costs between June 1, 2022 and May 31, 2023,"" HHS said in a statement Tuesday.Story continuesPundits predicted a number of other drugs that could be included based on spend, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, which did not make the list, but still could in subsequent years. The diabetes drug, an injectable that some have started to use for weight loss, has caused a spike in healthcare spend for employers in recent months.The companies will begin a negotiation process in early 2024, and CMS will publish the finalized negotiated rates next September.A Merck logo on a scientist's lab coat in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File)More lawsuits expectedMore than a half-dozen lawsuits have already been filed in various districts around the country, in what some analysts say is an attempt to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court. And more are expected after Tuesday's reveal.The company lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.The Biden Administration has said there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents Medicare from setting drug prices.""For far too long, pharmaceutical companies have made record profits while American families were saddled with record prices and unable to afford life-saving prescription drugs. But thanks to the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, we are closer to reaching President Biden’s goal of increasing availability and lowering prescription drug costs for all Americans,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement Tuesday.Some analysts believe the lawsuits will not be successful in delaying the negotiation process, which is slated to begin in February.Leerink Partners said in an updated note Monday that biopharma manufacturer exposure is immaterial because the estimated profits that could be impacted are a small percentage of global earnings.""But there could be some downward pressure on late-decade consensus expectations for certain products if litigation challenges to CMS’s ability to 'negotiate' fail, and sell-siders adjust US revenue estimates for exposed products,"" Leerink added.And nearly a year after the IRA was first passed, a recent poll shows 83% of Americans still support the idea of negotiating drug prices.Some of these same Americans could be negatively impacted by the move, the industry contends.Companies like AstraZeneca say it has affected how the company invests in research and development, and the lobbying group PhRMA says the costs the government is trying to save will result in restricted access to drugs for seniors covered by Part D. Both entities are suing HHS and CMS.John O'Brien, president and CEO of the National Pharmaceutical Council, said in a statement, ""Many important questions related to patient input, patient access and negotiated formularies, and therapeutic alternatives remain unanswered even as the process begins in earnest. There are also significant unintended consequences that are not yet well understood, such as how this process may create perverse incentives delaying launches, reducing subsequent indications, and chilling evidence generation.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our primer on wide moat investing, then check out 5 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks To Invest In. The strategy of wide moat investing has gained a lot of traction over the past few years. This strategy is most commonly attributed to Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett prefers stocks that he believes have a wide economic moat. Moat is competitive advantage that a firm has, and this protects it against competitors in the long term. Firms that are believed to have a moat that protects them for more than 20 years are called wide moat firms while those whose moat protects them for less than 20 years but more than 10 years are called narrow moat stocks. We've covered economic moats and Mr. Buffett's history with this investment strategy in a lot of detail as part of our coverage of 13 Best Wide Moat Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Naturally, as opposed to using financial metrics to segregate stocks, separating them based on their economic moats involves a lot of subjectivity. One popular yellow book of wide moat stocks that is relied on these days is Morningstar's economic moat rating. This rating criteria lists five factors that can be classified as an economic moat. These are switching costs, network effects, intangible assets, cost advantage, and efficient scale. Briefly exploring these, switching costs refer to the pain or monetary outflows that a customer might face when choosing a new product, network effects measure the value benefits to existing customers as more people use a product, while efficient scale measures a firm's market and the ability of new competitors to enter and increase the number of companies targeting the same revenue pie.Looking at these criteria, it's also possible to a list of companies with wide economic moats. Take the example of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles. The global electric vehicle market was estimated to be worth $384 billion by 2022 end and is expected to sit at $500 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2030 it is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.8% to be worth $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Tesla's 2022 revenue was $81.4 billion, making it represent a large portion of the total industry.Story continuesAnalyzing the firm's economic moat, there are few competitors that offer vehicles that are similar to Tesla's at least in the U.S. Other electric vehicle firms, such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID), have higher priced alternatives and other options are either available in limited quantities or offer lower range. When it comes to network effects, the more people that buy a Tesla, the larger the firm's charging network becomes which then increases the areas that the car can travel to. Tesla is also offering its charging infrastructure to other EV companies, which further expands its coverage. In terms of intangible assets, the firm's self driving platform is one of the strongest in the market, and the high costs of setting up manufacturing units and efficiently scaling up production also provide Tesla with a competitive advantage as new entrants often struggle and take years to mass produce vehicles. Of course, Tesla isn't the strongest example of a stock with a wide moat, but it does have some crucial advantages that set it apart from the pack. Morningstar, for its part, believes that Tesla is a narrow moat stock and some of the firms that it classifies as those with wide moats are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Apart from an economic moat, another way one can select stocks is to see if they are overvalued or undervalued. This is done by determining a fair price for the shares and then comparing it with the trading price. If the trading price is lower than the presumed fair value then the shares are undervalued and vice versa.

Earlier this year, he wrote for Fortune commentary that employees should work “hand in hand” with A.I., and months later he moved to freeze hiring given rapid advancements in the tech. At the same time, he predicted that A.I. could take over 30% to 50% of such rote jobs, even contending that A.I. could even do them better than humans could. And now he’s put his money where his mouth is, with IBM piling into a massive $235 million funding round for the $4.5 billion A.I. unicorn Hugging Face. And it’s not Krishna’s first tie-up with the popular open-source startup, either.On Friday, IBM announced it was participating in the $235 million Series D funding round for New York–based Hugging Face, the popular library of open-source machine learning models that have contributed greatly to the technology’s popularity as of late.Since May, Hugging Face and IBM had already been working together on a suite of A.I. tools. As of this month, IBM has also uploaded around 200 open A.I. models to Hugging Face’s platform. One of the models IBM posted to Hugging Face was a collaboration with NASA, marking the space agency’s first ever open-source A.I. model.In May, IBM announced it would work with Hugging Face on its watsonxai suite of A.I. tools. IBM’s watsonxai is essentially a studio that helps other companies build out a series of A.I.-powered products specific to their business. During the announcement at IBM’s Think conference in May, Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue said that through this partnership, IBM’s consultants would be able to offer Hugging Face’s vast assortment of models to clients that were interested in using A.I.Hugging Face also has partnerships with other major tech players including Microsoft and Amazon. The Amazon partnership is structured similarly to IBM’s, where Hugging Face models are available to AWS’s enterprise clients. Although it does have the added wrinkle that Hugging Face will use Amazon’s Trainium chip to train the next version of its own model, named Bloom.Story continuesIBM’s CEO is convinced A.I. is here to stayIBM has been bullish on the fact that A.I. will ultimately get integrated into practically every company. Krishna said he expected A.I. and machine learning to automate away many of the back-office processes that are ubiquitous in the workplace. IBM’s human resources department was able to get 50 people to do the work it had previously taken hundreds of HR managers to perform by using A.I., Krishna estimated.Krishna has on more than one occasions touted A.I. as a solution to a variety of problems that could impact productivity in the future. In May, Krishna said declining numbers in the working-age population mean A.I. would play an important role in economic productivity as companies face a shrinking labor force.More recently in an interview with CNBC, he added that A.I. would help keep quality of life high by spurring more productivity. Perhaps his most high-profile statement about A.I. was when he called for a hiring freeze of an estimated 7,800 roles the company expected to be impacted by A.I. over the next five years.Hugging Face’s impressive Series D financing roundIBM wasn’t the only big name in tech to pony up some cash for an investment in Hugging Face. Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, and Salesforce all participated. After its latest $235 million funding round the startup’s valuation is now $4.5 billion. That amount is more than double the roughly $2 billion valuation Hugging Face had during its last fundraising round in April 2022, according to data from PitchBook.Hugging Face’s valuation is reportedly 100 times the startup’s annualized revenue. That fact would ordinarily spook some investors but in this case likely reflects the appetite from investors to stake out claims in the biggest players in the burgeoning field of A.I.“Investing a relatively small amount of capital, even at 100x annualized revenue, is a sound strategic investment by IBM,” UBS wrote in an analyst note, commenting on the deal. “While the investment dollars are small, a deeper relationship and access to a leading provider of AI tools at a minimum provides market intelligence in a fast moving dynamic market.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Adding to the AI hopes is the company’s strong cloud division and improving outlook for the digital ad market. Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Its growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.However, sluggishness in the company’s Network advertisement business remains a headwind.

Raw material cost inflation and adverse foreign currency movements are other concerns.Nevertheless, Recovery in commercial flight hours, strength in process solutions and UOP businesses augur well for Honeywell’s growth. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and cost-control measures continue to drive the company’s top line.

Global business leaders remain unclear about the real, transformative power of AI and how to leverage it. The campaign is designed to define and differentiate watsonx as a force multiplier that can accelerate impact for global business leaders as they look to apply AI solutions in new and innovative ways.The two distinct spots feature a fast-paced, multi-media technique that aims to provide inspiration and guidance around the value proposition of watsonx, while underscoring the need to identify the right AI that will empower businesses to advance objectives and accelerate workloads. These concepts come to life through potential use cases that spotlight the importance of applying AI that is trusted, targeted, and built on the best open technology available. ""The Right AI""With watsonx, businesses have a unified platform to tap the best of IBM and open-source foundation models to create, deploy, and manage both traditional machine learning and generative AI that can be adapted to new scenarios. Importantly, client data used to train models with watsonx is not retained by IBM or used to benefit other organizations for any future training purposes, providing a solution with privacy and security. As the ads demonstrate, watsonx is enabling organizations of all kinds to reap a wide range of benefits with generative AI – from automating customer response times, accelerating code generation, automating key workflows with digital labor in departments such as HR, application modernization, IT automation and more.    ""Transforming Business"" ""In this new era of AI, businesses need bespoke solutions designed for value creation,"" said Jonathan Adashek, SVP of Marketing and Communications at IBM. ""That is why we launched watsonx, the AI platform that puts the power of foundation models and machine learning to work in the right ways, trained on a company's own secured data and tailored to their unique needs. With this new campaign, we're reinforcing the transformative power of AI for business to multiply output and ultimately help customers improve their outcomes."" Story continues""In today's business environment, companies that implement trusted AI tailored to their specific needs will have the upper hand. Laddering up to the brand's 'let's create' platform, 'watsonx your business' is a campaign that aims to clearly illustrate how IBM can help companies create the right AI for their business,"" said Matt Curry, Global Creative Lead at Ogilvy. ""We wanted the work to feel generative, like AI, always morphing and moving.The campaign uses design language in creative ways to express the benefit of watsonx — in one film we use a slot machine technique to convey that using the wrong AI is a gamble, while another uses an ""x"" wipe effect to show the transformative power of watsonx. In print, digital and OOH we use what we're calling a 'UI for AI,' including elements of the product UI in the copy to demonstrate what it can do. Throughout the process, we used AI to inspire or create different aspects of the work,"" according to Curry.Conceptualized and executed by the IBM Brand Marketing team and Ogilvy, the new broadcast spots were directed by Bonaparte's Mario Clement. Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor and producer Oscar Isaac provides the voice over. The campaign is the next phase of ""let's create,"" which launched in 2022 as IBM's most significant brand initiative in more than a decade. The spots will debut on August 28 during the US Open and run throughout the year. The campaign will include broadcast, digitally activated billboards on site at the US Open, out-of-home, connected TV, digital video, podcasts, print, newsletters, social and high-impact display.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HPE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.88, while IBM has a forward P/E of 15.41. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 1.67. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.69.Another notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.05. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

188,cd950f14-7005-3ee8-88c7-e5b8809451fb,IBM,2023-08-29,Dow 30 Stocks List: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-30-stocks-list-ranked-125905817.html,1693227545,STORY,"['^DJI', 'COMP', '^GSPC', 'DOW', 'CAT', 'WBA', 'IBM', 'BA', 'TRV', 'CSCO', 'VZ', 'MCD', 'MMM', 'AMGN', 'CVX', 'HD', 'KO', 'INTC', 'UNH', 'PG', 'AXP', 'HON', 'MSFT', 'NKE']","[In this article, we discuss Dow 30 stocks ranked in accordance with the hedge fund bullishness index. If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

This refinery is one of the largest in the United States, with the capacity to refine nearly 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The incident has led to a significant increase in gasoline and diesel fuel prices in futures markets. Let's explore the incident's specifics, the response and investigation, and the subsequent effect on business operations and petrol and diesel fuel prices in such markets.The IncidentOn the morning of Aug 25, a fire broke out at the Garyville refinery, which is known as the third-largest oil refinery in the United States. Situated in Southeast Louisiana, the refinery's location along the Mississippi River has strategic importance in the industry.The fire occurred in an area where crude oil and fuels are stored in massive circular tanks. Notably, the incident was accompanied by a leak of naphtha, a flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Local media footage depicted the fire affecting two large tanks, with significant rise in flames and smoke. The fire appeared to be within a contained area.Response and InvestigationMarathon swiftly responded to the incident by shutting down specific refinery units. This was a necessary safety measure to contain the situation and prevent further damage. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown at this point. However, the company has initiated a comprehensive investigation to determine the factors that led to this unfortunate event.Evacuation MeasuresMPC reported that one firefighter was being evaluated for heat stress, but no other injuries were reported.In an abundance of caution, St. John the Baptist Parish issued a temporary evacuation order for residents living within a two-mile radius of the refinery's affected area. This precautionary step aimed to safeguard individuals from potential risks and ensure their well-being during the incident.Story continuesRefinery Location and CapacityThe Garyville refinery has a significant role in the energy landscape, with a crude oil refining capacity of 596,000 barrels per day (bpd). Its production capacity includes 265,000 bpd of gasoline and 230,000 bpd of diesel. These figures highlight the refinery's importance in supplying essential fuels to meet consumer demands across the United States.Impact on OperationsThe incident has inevitably disrupted the refinery's operations, with the shutdown of units affecting the production of gasoline and diesel. The extent of the impact on the company's financials and the broader energy market will depend on the duration of the shutdown and the success of the investigation in determining the root cause of the fire.ConclusionThe Marathon refinery incident in Garyville has underscored the intricate interplay between industrial operations, safety protocols and market dynamics in the energy sector. As the company works diligently to fully extinguish the fire and assess the extent of the damage, the broader industry is grappling with the potential implications for fuel supply, pricing and market stability.

192,cfd8b68b-3937-3096-aa8e-eed65f7b8bce,GM,2023-08-29,UAW talks: Why the shift to EVs is such a big deal to workers,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-talks-why-shift-evs-213948787.html,1693258788,VIDEO,"['F', 'HYMTF', 'STLA', 'GM']","[United Auto Workers' members have authorized a strike in case negotiations with the Big Three U.S. automakers (GM, F, STLA) fail. One of the big reasons why the UAW is fighting right now is because of the shift to electric vehicles. As Autolist Editor-in-Chief David Undercoffler tells Yahoo Finance Live, there is a ""pretty significant"" pay between a union and non-union job in a comparable role. ""EVs are much simpler to manufacture by several orders of magnitude,"" Undercoffler says, adding that the UAW is likely looking to the future in a bid to help protect their members' jobs.Burnes Center for Social Change Senior Fellow Seth Harris says the ""critical issue"" in the transition to EV manufacturing will be wages, with workers wanting to ensure they will still get the ""same, quality wages in an electric vehicle battery plant that they were earning when they were helping to build internal combustion engine vehicles.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: The Department of Energy has recently put out some numbers about the number of jobs that have been created in the EV sector, clean energy sector overall. But in the EV space, it is the fastest growing in terms of jobs. More than 38,000 jobs added last year.I may be putting you on the spot here, but how big of a difference is it when you talk about pay between a union job and a non-union job in a comparable position?DAVID UNDERCOFFLER: Well, that's where the strength of the UAW really, they can sort of flex their might. It's pretty significant. EVs are much simpler to manufacture by several orders of magnitude. So you imagine this is sort of the UAW is facing maybe not an existential threat. But they're definitely looking at the future of their members and saying, look, if these EVs are much simpler to manufacture. They require fewer people to do that, fewer, less time to do so.We want to ensure that our workers are protected not just for the duration of this upcoming contract, which is about four years, but longer term. We sort of want to set the stage of the UAW certainly has a place at this table moving into the next 20 years of these EVs are built.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: And, David, is the expectation that the same number of jobs will be available on the other side?DAVID UNDERCOFFLER: That's going to be a main sticking point. The UAW is fighting for that. They're asking automakers maybe who are closing a union plant in the northeast and then opening up potentially a battery plant elsewhere in the country, like Seth was saying in a right to work area.They're asking that there's a union consideration or certainly there's been some noise recently with a battery plant in Ohio, where the UAW, they've voted to join the UAW, but they haven't yet ratified a contract. And that's a battery plant.So UAW is certainly looking for all the opportunities that as old school manufacturing of ICE closes down or shifts, that they have a seat at the table regardless of where those plants are opened.AKIKO FUJITA: It's that-- the president has made job growth within this sector, within the IRA or under the IRA, I should say, really a central theme as he sort of touts his economic accomplishments. But I'm thinking back to a year ago when the IRA was passed, where you talked about not just good paying jobs within a new industry, but also helping workers transition into these new skills.You think the White House has done enough to help workers who have been in these more legacy businesses transition into this new economy, particularly union workers?SETH HARRIS: The critical issue in that transition is, as David said, going to be wages. Can workers earn the same quality wages in an electric vehicle battery plant that they were working, that they were earning when they were helping to build internal combustion engine vehicles.And in that plant that David mentioned called Ultium Cells, the UAW has already cut a deal with management even before they get a full collective bargaining agreement to immediately raise wages for the workers in that battery plant. That's what I expect to see happening throughout the industry. The transition, the skills transition I think is not going to be especially difficult. These are very highly skilled workers with a lot of experience with automotive manufacturing.I think that teaching them how to make lithium batteries is not going to be all that challenging. So I don't think that's going to be a problem. The question is going to be, will they want to transition into those jobs because they are high paying jobs with good quality benefits and where they have a union in the workplace to defend their interests.]"

To skip the detailed analysis of the EV industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy.Electric vehicles (EV) have become a significant disruptor in the automotive industry. EVs have almost completely taken over the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles market in some countries. For example, 79% of all the vehicles registered last year in Norway were pure electric. On the other hand, the pure ICEs only represented nearly 7% of the total vehicles sold in the country. There were over 10 million electric vehicles sold in 2022, including plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV). Around 7.657 million of them were battery electric vehicles (BEV).According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), EVs are expected to cover 18% of the global vehicle market in 2023 with 14 million sales, compared to 14% in 2022. EVs have already shown their strength in the first half of 2023. In the first quarter, sales were up 25% year-over-year and according to a PwC report, the BEV sales alone went up by 52% in the second quarter of 2023.Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has ruled the global EV market for over a decade. However, other companies are stepping in to put a stop to its undisputed dominance. Its closest competitor is the Chinese auto manufacturer, BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDY), which covered 11.9% of the total BEV market share in 2022, compared to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s 17.15%. Including BYD Company, most of the other major Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) competitors are Chinese companies. On the other hand, behemoths of the automotive industry, such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) have also started to increase their EV production over the years. Even the Italian supercar manufacturer, Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) is planning to unveil its first pure electric car in 2025. Nonetheless, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also making moves to retain its dominance. The company has cut its vehicle prices six times this year before May. The company also launched cheaper versions of Model S and X. According to the Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, interest rates were one of the driving factors of price cuts. At Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Q2 earnings call, he said:Story continues“And, you know -- and then, obviously, another challenge is the -- the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with that decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car. So, when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the -- the interest payments increase the price of the car. So -- and this is at least -- at least up until recently was to believe the sharpest interest rate rise in history.”The latest to join the list of EV market competitors, VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS), launched its IPO on August 15 and reached a valuation of $86 billion on opening day and reached a market cap of nearly $160 billion by August 25. The Vietnamese EV maker is listed on NASDAQ and its stock has gone up by 346.56% between August 18 and August 25 market close.The IEA estimates that 60% of all vehicles on the road will be electric. The prediction is dependent on broadening battery manufacturing and the constant supply of necessary minerals. However, Reuters reported that lithium producers are facing permit delays, labor shortages, and inflation, which may hinder battery production for EVs. On top of that, PwC believes that the electric charging market will have to grow tenfold by 2030 to meet the EV charging demand in the US.During this high demand growth for EVs, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) are some of the most promising EV stocks.12 Most Undervalued EV Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Fundsmichael-fousert-YhXlYJYlr3c-unsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we chose the 12 most undervalued EV stocks based on their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2023.

Yahoo Finance Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down these developments while also detailing the latest demands in the United Auto Workers (UAW) union's negotiations with the Big 3 automakers — Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA).Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Switching gears, Hyundai is facing pressures from groups in Alabama and Georgia around labor conditions after undergoing an investigation from the Department of Labor last year, which uncovered violations of child labor laws. The auto company recently invested $5.5 billion in a new electric vehicle factory in Savannah. Yahoo Finance's own Pras Subramanian joins us now with more. Pras, what do we know about this one so far?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, Brad, you said it, man. That's $5.5 billion new plant coming in Georgia, an EV and battery plant coming up. But in another plant that they have, I believe in Alabama they had the investigation into the child labor law violations. So these Union groups, as well as labor groups, AFL-CIO, one of them saying that we want to ensure that there's safe labor conditions in the supply chain and the battery factory there in the new plants in-- I'm sorry, in Georgia.And they say they also want livable wages too. So they want to ensure that these things are happening. And lots of stake here as the IRA passage has created a lot of big incentives for companies to build factories in America. Labor is saying, hey, we can't all get them to be UAW or Union shops, but we want to make sure that they have livable wages and safe conditions for working-- for workers, I mean.The child labor stuff, I thought was a pretty big deal when it came out last year. That was surprising and eye opening to see that. How can you have children working in a car factory?BRAD SMITH: Yeah.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: But it was happening.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, Pras, looking ahead, the deadline is looming in the ongoing battle over the UAW versus the auto giants. What can you tell us about that?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes, over-- at the end of the week last week, the UAW got strike authorization from its members. There was a 97% strike vote, which is not surprising because we knew that was going to happen in the last time in 2019. The strike authorization vote was around 96%. So what that means is basically, it gives leadership the ability to call a strike when the deal expires. So currently, the deal is up until September 14. And once that happens, the Union can decide to strike or actually keep working together with the automakers to try to get a deal hammered out.So you're seeing some of the things that the Union wants. We've heard about how they want wage increases of almost 40%. They want to restore cost of living adjustments. They want to get rid of compensation tiers amongst new workers and old workers. They want to define pension plan. One of the things that they also wanted was a potential four-day workweek, which I think some people on the automotive side are shaking their heads, saying that that's never going to happen.So they have a lot of high demands, big demands here because they feel like-- the Unions feel like they sort of compromised a lot back in 2008 when they wanted to help out the automakers during the great financial crisis. So they feel like now is the time to get what they're missing. And I think that we might see a very contentious battle up until the 14th. But no one knows what will happen. Maybe they'll get a deal. We'll see. But right now, the leadership is able to call strike if need be past the 14th of September.BRAD SMITH: All right, Yahoo Finance's own Pras Subramanian. They're tracking all things autos, mobility, and getting from point A to point B.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Thanks so much, Pras. Appreciate it.]"

During the month of September, the airline will highlight Welcome Sesame on its Miles on a Mission platform, an industry-leading crowd-sourcing program that now makes it easier than ever for its loyalty program members to do good and donate miles to national and local nonprofits.United will match up to one million miles raised for Sesame Workshop initiative through its Miles on a Mission platform.Donated miles will help Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind Sesame Street, travel around the world to deliver early learning and nurturing care to children and caregivers impacted by conflict and crisis – including children and families in Ukraine, the Middle East, South Asia, Latin America, East Africa, and other affected regions.United will match the first million miles raised by Sesame Workshop before the end of the year.""We're rallying our most loyal customers to join us in supporting the incredible work that only Sesame Workshop can do – for children around the world who need it the most,"" said Josh Earnest, SVP and Chief Communications Officer. ""In times of crisis, our United team routinely mobilizes our jets to help transport relief supplies where they are needed and get people out of harm's way. Extending our partnership with Sesame Workshop allows Mileage Plus members to donate miles and maximize the impact of these critical relief efforts, because we know Good Leads the Way for so many of our most loyal customers, too.""United's Miles on a Mission program is now even more accessible to nonprofit charities – lowering the total amount of miles from 200,000 to 100,000 to receive their award and extending the amount of time a nonprofit can mile-raise from 30 days to 90 days – giving participating groups more opportunities to promote their cause and reach their goal.Story continuesThe updated program also makes it easier for MileagePlus Members to get involved with more opportunities to use their miles for good. Members will receive more updates throughout the year, including community-focused stories, donation celebrations, donor highlights and the chance to get involved during United's annual Miles on a Mission Week of Giving.""Sesame Workshop is thrilled to collaborate with United's Miles on a Mission to bring education and joy to even more children and families through our Welcome Sesame initiative,"" said Sesame Workshop President Sherrie Westin. ""We know children are remarkably resilient, and if they have access to quality early childhood development support, they can overcome adversity and build a brighter future.""More than 400 million children live in areas currently affected by violent conflict, and over 43 million children around the world have been forcibly displaced.

The DOT alleges that on 43 flights, American Airlines kept passengers on planes during long delays without giving them the opportunity to exit. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the implications for the airline.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. Well, let's take a look at another trending ticker that we're watching. American Airlines is getting hit with a $4.1 million fine from the US Department of Transportation, saying the airline kept passengers on planes dozens of times without the opportunity to exit during delays.Now, this is the largest fine an airline has faced from the department since the implementation of guidelines for extended ground delays were enforced about 10 years ago.And, Brad, so this is about the amount of time that they keep people sitting on the tarmac, not giving people a chance to deplane. So good news for-- good news for consumers who are perhaps looking for some recourse, missing connecting flights. You have a lot of airline staff who have sort of once they're off the clock, you might have to deplane and get on another plane. A win for the consumer even though the dollar amount doesn't seem super significant.BRAD SMITH: Well, here's what's even more interesting about this. Earlier this year, American Airlines had actually implemented kind of an AI-generated rebooking type of system and add on to their service, where if it looked like you weren't going to make your next flight or your connecting flight, that they would automatically rebook you hoping to kind of cut down on the amount of time that people had to spend in lines trying to rebook through customer service, time spent on phones, and so forth.And so now this enters the larger question of, OK, so how many of the passengers were actually missing flights because not only were they being held on the tarmac or sitting on that flight or the plane and American Airlines keeping them on that flight and them not being able to make that connection, but then on the other side, also having to wait it for a longer period of time to ultimately make their connection because they were automatically rebooked as well.So it's kind of a confluence of both the operation that they had changed up, as well as what is being discovered here today with this $4.1 million fine for the ground delays as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And some of that was offset because some of that about 2.05 million was credited to the airline for some of the compensation that they did already give to some people who did have their flights impacted. But a small number, but it is that warning shot that the regulators are paying attention to this. So potentially we'll see-- might see more action. It might put more of these airlines on notice as well.]"

SMMF has raised its quarterly dividend five times in the last five years. Also, it has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 8.68%. Currently, its payout ratio is 21% of earnings.Considering the last day’s closing price of $24.74, SMMF’s dividend yield currently stands at 3.56%, which is above the industry’s average of 2.93%. Apart from attracting investors, this dividend yield represents a steady income stream.Summit Financial pays dividends regularly. Also, the company has a share repurchase program in place. In first-quarter 2020, it announced a buyback program of up to 750,000 shares. As of Jun 30, 2023, it repurchased 323,577 shares. We believe such disbursements highlight the company’s operational strength and commitment to enhancing shareholders’ wealth.Summit Financial has been growing through acquisitions as well.

People opting to spend on services such as vacations are also not helping the cause of a discretionary goods retailer like Best Buy.The company said Tuesday it saw sizable sales declines in key departments such as mobile phones, consumer electronics, and appliances. While it called out an improvement in the low end of its full-year EPS guidance versus that several months back, it still trimmed the top end — a nod to possible holiday spending softness.Moreover, its third quarter sales guidance suggests the back-to-school electronics shopping season has started on a slow note.""Consumers remain very deal focused,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told analysts on an earnings call, adding shoppers are more keen on spending on travel at the moment.The earnings rundownNet Sales: -7.2% year over year to $9.58 billion vs. estimates for $9.53 billionSame-Store Sales: -6.2% vs. estimates for -6.4%Domestic Same-Store Sales: -7.1%International Same-Store Sales: -5.4%Gross Profit Margin: 27% vs. 21.5% a year ago and estimates for 22.61%Diluted EPS: -21% year over year to $1.22 vs. estimates for $1.07What else caught our attentionQ2 domestic segment gross profit margins rose to 23.1% from 22% last year.Q2 international segment operating profit margins fell to 2.7% from 3.7% a year ago.Q2 overall operating margins were unchanged year on year at 3.6%.Q2 inventory fell 6.5% from a year ago, slower than the pace of sales.Q2 same-store sales declines in the domestic segment: computing and mobile phones -6.4%; consumer electronics -5.7%; appliances -16%.Q2 same-store sales increases in the domestic segment: entertainment up 9%; services up 7.6%; other up 2.4%.Q2 same-store sales fell in all segments for the international segment, except for a 2.5% increase in entertainment and a 4.6% gain in services.Q3 same-store sales seen as ""slightly better"" than the 6.2% drop in the second quarter.August same-store sales tracking down 6%, per BBY's CFO on earnings call.Q4 (holiday quarter) same-store sales seen -3% to slightly positive.2023 EPS guidance: $6.00 to $6.40 vs. estimates for $6.06 (prior: $5.70 to $6.50)Story continuesWhat competitors said: Q2 general merchandise salesWalmart US same-store sales of general merchandise fell by a low-single digit percentage due to weakness in home goods and apparel.Sam's Club US same-store sales of tech merchandise declined by a low-double digit percentage due to softness in consumer electronics.""After years of stimulus-fueled purchasing, the discretionary dollar is harder for our members to part with, and buying habits are returning toward normal. This has affected sizable general merchandise categories, such as consumer electronics, along with more seasonal categories like patio and outdoor furniture."" -BJ's Wholesale CEO Bob EddyWhat Wall Street is saying post earnings""BBY put up mixed results — (i) 2Q EPS beat led by slightly better than expected SSS and strong GM performance, (ii) full year SSS was lowered with 3Q SSS set below the Street, and (iii) full year EBIT margin/EPS were raised to the high-end of the prior range reflecting 1H margin strength. In our view, the print was largely in-line with market expectations. BBY is executing well on what’s under their control, but the backdrop remains challenging from a demand perspective. We remain concerned the recovery in consumer electronics spending will take longer than BBY’s base case and be choppy, limiting the potential snapback in EBIT margin rate and earnings power. The new concern of credit losses weighing on profitability should be an overhang for BBY shares since it was a material tailwind to EBIT margin rate the past several years. Stay Sell-rated with a $70 target price."" -Citi analyst Steven Zaccone""We walk away encouraged to hear a few categories posted flat y/y unit growth in 2Q, though timing of the forthcoming CE cycle remains difficult to pin down. With '24 poised to see replacements stemming from the first wave of COVID demand, deferral from '23, and recent product innovation, transactions could be positive. Combined with LSD% pricing from innovations, +LSD% comp growth driving slight EBIT% expansion remains our base case.

One such stock that merits attention is Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP). The stock, which is currently priced at 65.63, recorded a gain of 2.52% in a day and a 3-month increase of 39.83%. The stock's fair valuation is $103.41, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with BXP. Click here to check it out. BXP 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BXPThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Boston Properties (BXP) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConsidering the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Boston Properties should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.74. These indicators suggest that Boston Properties, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesA Closer Look at Boston PropertiesBoston Properties owns over 190 properties consisting of approximately 54 million rentable square feet of space.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 0.84%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 25.23%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Royal Caribbean Group.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with RCL. Click here to check it out. RCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of RCLUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Royal Caribbean Group (RCL)Deciphering the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 8/105. Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Royal Caribbean Group the GF Score of 66 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Royal Caribbean Group's BusinessRoyal Caribbean Group, with a market cap of $25.34 billion, operates as the world's second-largest cruise company. It runs 64 ships across five global and partner brands in the cruise vacation industry, with 10 more ships on order through 2026. The company's brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea. It also has a 50% investment in a joint venture that operates TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. The company's sales stand at $12.01 billion, with an operating margin of 11.4%. However, the divestiture of its Azamara brand in the first quarter of 2021 may impact its future performance.Story continuesUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Royal Caribbean Group (RCL)Financial Strength BreakdownRoyal Caribbean Group's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.91 positions it worse than 84.71% of 556 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.7, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years.Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.04 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 6.25, which is worse than 94.9% of 667 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 7.29, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 75.39% of 573 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Royal Caribbean Group seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -12.7 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 71.65% of 769 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Royal Caribbean Group predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Challenges Ahead for Royal Caribbean Group (RCL)ConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Royal Caribbean Group has a rich history and a strong market presence, its current financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future.

Consequently, the central bank is open for more hikes in the near future.According to Powell, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”Justifying the fact for the Fed fund rate to move higher, Powell said, “The economy may not be cooling as expected. So far this year, GDP growth has come in above expectations and above its longer-run trend, and recent readings on consumer spending have been especially robust. In addition, after decelerating sharply over the past 18 months, the housing sector is showing signs of picking back up.”Surprisingly, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — advanced 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively, after Powell’s warning of more rate hikes. The small-cap benchmark, the Russell 2000, also gained 0.4%.After Powell’s comments, market participants are directionless regarding the future trajectory of interest rate movement. The CME FedWatch is currently showing that the there exists an 80% probability that the Fed will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.5%, while a 20% chance of rate hike by 25 basis points in the September FOMC meeting.However, for the November FOMC meeting, a 44.5% probability is assigned for maintaining a status quo and a 55.5% probability is assigned for a rate hike of 25 basis points or more.Whatever the situation, market participants have cheered the Fed Chairman’s acknowledgment that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain rock solid despite suffering from a double-edged sword — a 40-year high inflation rate and a more than 22-year high interest rate.The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. On Aug 24, the Atlanta Fed estimated the GDP growth rate to climb 5.9% in the third quarter. These data eliminate the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.Story continuesThe major catalyst of U.S. economy is personal consumption expenditure (consumer spending), which accounts for nearly 70% of the GDP. Therefore, at this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in consumer-centric stocks to enrich one’s portfolio.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) consumer-centric stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023.

Dillard’s stock currently has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum with the Q2 earnings beat mostly attributed to robust sales, improved margins, and lower expenses.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat makes Dillard’s stock most compelling at the moment is its “A” Zacks Style Score for Value. To that point, Dillard’s stock trades at just 8.6X forward earnings which is roughly on par with its industry average and a very attractive discount to the S&amp;P 500’s 20.6X.Now looks like a good time to buy with many analysts starting to raise their price targets and Dillard’s recently bumped its quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoss Stores ROST: Also surpassing Q2 earnings expectations a few weeks ago, Ross Stores displayed its effective niche as an off-price apparel retailer in heavily populated urban and suburban areas.Earnings of $1.32 per share beat Q2 estimates of $1.17 a share by 13%. Ross Stores stock also has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum with a long list of analysts raising their price targets. It's noteworthy that the current Average Zacks Price Target offers 8% upside from current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, Ross Stores' bottom line is still expanding landing the company a “B” Style Scores grade for Growth.Annual earnings are now projected to climb 18% in Ross Stores’ current fiscal 2024 and jump another 10% in FY25 to $5.71 per share. Along with steady growth, Ross Stores offers investors a respectable 1.13% annual dividend yield.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUrban Outfitters URBN: At the moment Urban Outfitters stock checks all the trading boxes with an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Urban Outfitters has become a fashionista for Generation Z, with the younger demographic being a catalyst for the company’s growth. Offering trendy fashion apparel and accessories, Urban Outfitters crushed Q2 EPS estimates by 23% last Tuesday with earnings coming in at $1.10 per share compared to expectations of $0.89 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore impressive, annual earnings are now projected at $3.18 per share in Urban Outfitters' current FY24 which would be an 82% increase from FY23 EPS of $1.75. Plus, FY25 earnings are expected to rise another 6%.Intriguingly, investors aren’t paying a premium for Urban Outfitters' expansive growth with URBN shares trading at a 10.4X forward earnings multiple. In fact, this is a nice discount to the benchmark and its own industry average of 16.1X.Analysts have also started to raise their price targets for Urban Outfitters stock and the current Average Zacks Price Target offers 17% upside from current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line After impressive earnings beats this month, EPS estimates have trended higher for these retail stocks which correlates with their Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ross Stores basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Ross Stores imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 6.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Ross Stores to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

214,4b8d4476-a5d3-3873-aca4-7b33af6c9349,SBAC,2023-08-29,Does SBA Communications (SBAC) Have the Potential to Rally 28.61% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-sba-communications-sbac-potential-135505298.html,1693230905,STORY,"['SBAC', 'TGT']","[SBA Communications (SBAC) closed the last trading session at $222.33, gaining 1.6% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $285.94 indicates a 28.6% upside potential.The average comprises 16 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $245 to a high of $340, with a standard deviation of $29.51. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 10.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 52.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in SBAC. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SBAC Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.3% over the past month, as six estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, SBAC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SBAC could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

215,552c5cfe-79ea-3529-ba9f-d330f90d2e33,RF,2023-08-29,HSBC's Innovation Banking Expands Venture Debt Offerings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hsbcs-innovation-banking-expands-venture-124000398.html,1693226400,STORY,"['HSBA.L', 'USB', 'HSBC', 'RF']","[HSBC Holdings HSBC has announced an expansion of its venture debt offering through its Innovation Banking division in the United States. This move demonstrates its commitment to supporting innovation companies across all stages of development, from Series A startups to scaled multi-national enterprises.The expansion aligns with HSBC's strategy of catering to companies in their earliest phases, marking a shift from their previous focus on later-stage innovation firms.David Sabow, U.S. Head of HSBC Innovation Banking, pointed out that HSBC's existing relationships with large technology and healthcare corporations, combined with their expanded focus on early-stage innovators, eliminate the need for these companies to switch banking partners as they evolve.Venture debt, a flexible financing option for high-growth companies backed by venture capital, allows these enterprises to extend their funding runway and accelerate growth. HSBC, renowned for its expertise in serving innovation companies worldwide, is well-positioned to offer this valuable venture debt solution alongside its comprehensive suite of banking products.HSBC Innovation Banking boasts a team of more than 40 dedicated bankers spread across key innovation hubs such as the Bay Area, Boston and New York City in the United States, as well as teams in the U.K., Tel Aviv and Hong Kong. The global presence ensures well-connected and specialized banking expertise to support a diverse range of innovation businesses and their investors.The expansion of HSBC Innovation Banking’s venture debt offering will be led by industry veterans who bring extensive experience and insight to the table. The effort will bolster the company’s reputation as a leader in international banking for innovation companies.One of the noteworthy achievements in HSBC's journey toward fostering innovation is the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited (SVB UK) this March. The move emphasizes the company’s commitment to consolidate its commercial banking presence in the U.K. and globally.The acquisition of SVB UK has provided HSBC with a strategic advantage to serve a wide range of innovative and fast-growing firms, mainly in the technology and life science sectors. This acquisition came after the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, which specialized in lending to technology companies, marking one of the biggest U.S. bank failures since the 2008 financial crisis.HSBC's expansion of its venture debt offering through its Innovation Banking division signifies a commitment to nurturing innovation across all stages of development. As it continues to connect innovation companies with tailored banking and lending solutions, the global economy stands to benefit from the growth and evolution of these pioneering enterprises.Over the past few years, HSBC has been trying to restructure its operations to further improve operating efficiency and focus more on the Asia region. As part of these initiatives, the bank, in 2020, announced its transformation plan to reshape underperforming businesses, simplify complex organizations and lower costs.The company realized gross savings of $5.6 billion, with a cost to achieve a spend of $6.5 billion by 2022-end. HSBC expects to achieve an additional $1 billion of gross cost savings this year, driven by the actions undertaken in 2022.Moreover, as part of its Asia focus plan, HSBC intends to position itself as a top bank for high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients in the region. It has re-launched its private banking business in India after eight years. Further, last year, it acquired 100% of the issued share capital of AXA Insurance in Singapore and L&amp;T Investment Management Limited.These steps, along with strong brand value, higher rates and widespread network, help HSBC further bolster its presence globally.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 20.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the growth of 7.1% for the industry.

Card network revenues improved 7.8% year over year to $34 million and beat the consensus mark by 4.4%.Total operating expenses of $689.7 million escalated 7.5% year over year, due to a rise in all the expense components, barring loss on loan purchase commitment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.Loss on loan purchase commitment plunged 13.1% year over year to $35 million in the quarter under review.Affirm reported a net loss of $206 million, which was wider than the year-ago quarter’s $186.4 million.Story continuesThe adjusted operating margin was 3.3% in the June quarter, while the metric stood at negative 8% in the prior-year quarter.Financial Position (as of Jun 30, 2023)Affirm exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $892 million, which declined from $1,255.2 million at fiscal 2022-end.

V, Mastercard Incorporated MA and The Western Union Company WU.Visa reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%. Its strong quarterly results benefited on the back of higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Solid cross-border travel growth and higher-than-expected data processing aided V’s results, partially offset by increased costs.Mastercard reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. The quarterly results gained from strong consumer spending, specifically across the travel sector, and an enhanced services suite. Significant cross-border volume growth also contributed to the upside. Nevertheless, MA’s performance was partially offset by an escalating operating cost level.Western Union reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 51 cents, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. Its earnings were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, inflation in Argentina and better-than-expected C2C transactions. WU’s Evolve 2025 strategy’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by increased expenses.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.0%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. View our latest analysis for News News' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Prior to this announcement, News' dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 19% of free cash flows. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 16%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendNews Is Still Building Its Track RecordIt is great to see that News has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. The last annual payment of $0.20 was flat on the annual payment from8 years ago. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much.News Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that News has been growing its earnings per share at 58% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which News hasn't been doing.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 3 warning signs for News that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

Also, longer device holding periods are reducing upgrade costs &amp; stabilizing churn.""The analysts say that the stocks' current valuations ""may be discounting more than full-remediation cost scenarios for lead, while anticipated updates could help to level and possibly narrow the perceived risk,"" referring to recent controversy borne of a Wall Street Journal report that the companies are using contaminating lead-covered cables, which could lead to high remediation costs.Verizon shares were gaining 1.4% to $34.02 in recent premarket trading.

The potential settlement was first reported by Bloomberg News.Wolfe views the settlement amount “as good as could have been expected.”Story continuesThe remaining challenges are that there is still a highly uncertain event path, and we view the upcoming Healthcare spin as a catalyst for a dividend cut.

However, UBS believes there's still significant room for Oracle's AI story to unfold. It pointed out several factors supporting this perspective. “a) we may be just one quarter into AI start-ups ramping their use of OCI, and we don’t think that Cohere has kicked-off its ramp yet; b) we are sitting in front of what could be a constructive CloudWorld event and Investor day” mentioned UBS.Furthermore, the firm noted the P/E multiple of 20x doesn’t look full on its estimates, as well as only a minority (around 40%) of sell-side analysts even rate Oracle shares a Buy.Mister Car Wash jumps 6% following Piper Sandler upgradeMister Car Wash (NYSE:MCW) shares rose more than 6% yesterday after Piper Sandler upgraded the company to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $12.00 from $9.00.This rating change is based on the anticipation of a significant upside to estimates over the next two years. Piper Sandler expects the company's rollout of Titanium 360 to contribute to around a 5% increase in comparable sales for both 2024 and 2025.The reduction in competitive openings in 2024 is also expected to ease pressure on Retail sales industry-wide.

The new tool is aimed at helping users save money when making online purchases.“We’ve introduced a full suite of tools on Yahoo Mail to help users save time and money, making strides toward an assistive inbox,” said Josh Jacobson, senior vice president and general manager of Yahoo Mail, in a statement. “In total, US consumers have $23 billion in unused gift cards and credits, and we hope our new tools will help users gain a fraction of that back in their wallets.”As for the upgrades to Yahoo Mail's existing capabilities, the company is launching upgrades to the service's search and writing assistant features.Yahoo Mail's search bar now suggests common questions to help users find what they’re looking for. Instead of having to rely on keywords, users can now just ask a question, or select from a list of prompted queries relevant to their search terms like, “how much did I spend on groceries last week?” Plus, there are new filters (e.g. From, To, Date) to help users narrow search results even further.The company's writing assistant, which drafts suggested replies in the voice of the user, can now write in several tones.

With the expectation of significant damage from strong winds and flooding from the storm, Verizon’s network team is preparing for the worst. While the use of battery and generator backup systems in critical locations such as cell sites and network operations centers serve to minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost, even the most hardened infrastructure can be shaken by Mother Nature.In case emergency network recovery becomes necessary after Hurricane Idalia makes landfall, Verizon is prepared to respond quickly. Verizon has readied its fleet of portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cell sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service and situational awareness from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon has pre-staged satellite-based portable network assets that can provide an alternate way to connect cell sites to the rest of the network in the event that a fiber cable is lost due to commercial power outages or physical damage. All of these mobile assets are complemented by portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program ready to keep the network running in case of commercial power outages.Are you ready for the storm?Verizon’s retail team stands ready to assist customers and ensure they have the right devices, accessories and connectivity they’ll need to weather the storm. And convenient options like locker, curbside and in store pickup provide quick ways to get what you need and get out.In addition to the right tech, you’ll also want to take steps to ensure your family is prepared for the season as well. When a storm is forecast:Story continuesKeep devices dry: While many phones today are some degree of water resistant, you still want to take some extra care to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, and there are weatherproof phones, phone cases and other protective accessories available.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure your device is ready when you need it by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged in case commercial power goes out.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs can be a game-changer to ensure you remain connected. Don’t forget your car chargers as well in case you need to evacuate.Create a list: Keep a list of emergency numbers in your phone so that you have them if needed.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims. And make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud so you have a backup.Review checklists: Review the hurricane preparedness checklist, power outage checklist and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free weather, news, and safety-related apps available for download to your smartphone.Business continuity is criticalThe need for a secure, reliable connection for business continuity is never more apparent than during severe weather events and other emergencies. This is especially important with today’s increasingly common hybrid-work environments, in which highly distributed and mobile workforces rely on remote collaboration and digital networking tools to conduct business across wide-ranging and local areas simultaneously.The Verizon Business portfolio of solutions and partners provides continuity of service for customers of all sizes from the largest enterprise to the small business that is the heart of the community. From SD-WAN and advanced security tools, to cloud and edge applications, fleet management and tracking through Verizon Connect, private networks and fixed-wireless Internet for primary or backup connectivity, Verizon’s network strategy gives customers the flexibility so that they’re ready for anything.In an emergency situation, agility is vital, so now is a great time to assess readiness plans ahead of storm season. Suggested steps for businesses include:Make sure you have contact information updated and readily available for all employees, including at-home information for remote workers and branch information for satellite offices.Stress-test primary and backup networks and shore up any weak areas.Make copies of insurance documents, review insurance coverages and update as appropriate.Ensure employees working from home have documented all corporate equipment being used to work from home in case of damage or loss.Ensure backup plans are in place to shift work in case work-from-home employees in a storm-impacted area have to evacuate their home or their home loses commercial power.Verizon Frontline is ready to support first respondersThe Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to deploy in support of public safety agencies — at no cost to the supported agencies — to ensure they have the mission-critical communications support they need when responding to severe weather and other crisis events.This year alone, the team has responded to more than 1,000 requests for communications support from more than 500 federal, state and local public safety agencies in 48 states and the District of Columbia. They have delivered more than 4,800 Verizon Frontline solutions to these agencies to help provide mission-critical voice and data service to first responders on the front lines.Composed primarily of former first responders and military veterans, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to public safety agencies and emergency responders. The team is available 24/7 to deliver Verizon Frontline technologies including portable cell sites, drones, charging stations, WiFi hotspots, and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that enable communications and/or boost network performance.Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.After an emergency, call before you digDebris clean up and property repair are important tasks after a storm. Before beginning to clean up and make repairs, call 811 or visit call811.com to determine where fiber or other cables are buried. Contacting 811 before any digging project, large or small, is the easiest step toward reducing the chance of damaging underground fiber and keeping customers and first responders connected in critical moments. Fiber is the invisible footprint that moves data throughout Verizon’s network across the country and around the world. Verizon owns and operates over 1 million miles of fiber; that’s enough to wrap around Earth 40 times. Cutting those cables when digging can result in customers losing service and data connections being lost. So before storm clean up begins, call 811.**Editor’s Note: To access images and b-roll of past storms, Verizon equipment, recovery efforts and more, please visit Verizon’s Media Resource Hub at https://www.verizon.com/about/news/media-resources For emergency response information, please visit https://www.verizon.com/about/news/emergency-resource-centerVerizon Communications Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

OPK is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its potential in RAYALDEE. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 performance and few notable partnerships are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and concerns regarding overdependence on RAYALDEE persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 24.8% against the 1.9% rise of the industry and 9.3% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company has a market capitalization of $1.34 billion. It projects 44.4% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. OPKO Health’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missed once and broke even in the other, the average surprise being 29.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Potential in RAYALDEE: We are upbeat about OPKO Health’s RAYALDEE business. Rayaldee is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with stage three or four chronic kidney disease and vitamin D insufficiency. Revenues from sales of RAYALDEE in the second quarter of 2023 were up 24.2% from the prior-year period.Strategic Agreements: OPKO Health has entered into a slew of agreements over the past few months. On the second-quarter 2023 earnings call, management stated having a partnership with the National Institutes of Health to develop a tri-specific candidate to both prevent and treat HIV. Management also confirmed working on a COVID multi-specific antibody program to address the emergence of resistant variants on a global basis.Strong Q2 Results: OPKO Health’s better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. Its confirmation that NGENLA (somatrogon) has been approved in 44 markets, including the United States, Japan, EU Member States, Canada and Australia, looks promising. Also, its continued sales by Pfizer in more than 18 countries with expectations to launch in all priority international markets by the year-end raises our optimism about OPKO Health.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The pharmaceutical, diagnostic and laboratory testing industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. Numerous companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, are engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products competitive with those that OPKO Health intends to commercialize itself and through its partners.Overdependence on RAYALDEE: OPKO Health’s RAYALDEE is the company’s only pharmaceutical product approved for marketing in the United States. The company’s ability to generate revenues from product sales and achieve profitability substantially depends on its ability to effectively commercialize RAYALDEE. The failure to successfully commercialize RAYALDEE would have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.Estimate TrendOPKO Health is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from 28 cents to 20 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $174.9 million, suggesting a 2.7% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

The release date for Dune: Part Two was pushed from November of 2023 to March of 2024. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses the strikes' impact on upcoming content and breaks down the areas where the studios and unions disagree.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the prolonged actors and writers strike continues to shake up the box office. Warner Bros confirmed that its film ""Dune: Part Two"", the sci-fi sequel starring Timothy Shamoley and Zendaya, is pushing back its release date as the strikes linger. For more on this story, we're joined by Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal. So, Allie, Barry Diller says the strikes needed to be settled by September 1st otherwise there won't be many movies for anyone to watch next year. So where do things stand now?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Well, Rachelle, things are still at a standstill at this point. And that's September 1st deadline I do think it's a relevant one. But rather it being a hard and fast line, I think it more so represents if writers are not working on new projects now, we're not going to be getting any new content come the new year. And that's going to drag revenues down across the board. And, you know, for the studio side, I think even compared to where we were a month ago, you're certainly seeing a little more urgency there.They're starting to really worry that that they're not going to have that content to aid subscribers and fuel that revenue growth. But there remains critical areas where the two sides just don't align. Number one being artificial intelligence and the use of AI in entertainment. The writers want to guarantee that studios won't use their scripts to train AI, whereas the studios don't want to set a precedent given how new this technology is and addition to the fact that they're saying they own the scripts. And then separately there are other issues like minimum staffing requirements. Studios are saying that should be up to the discretion of the head writer, and then streaming residuals.Story continuesAnother big sticking point writers want pretty hefty bonuses if their shows and movies do well on these streaming platforms. Seems like that should be the case. However, studios just simply don't have the cash to commit to what they want at this point. So a lot of unknowns, a lot of TBDs. There still seems to be a hefty amount of friction, and that's going to mean more economic losses down the line. Milken is saying that that 4 billion projection of losses, that could balloon to 5 billion. And, you know, we're only in a few months of this strike. If this continues through the end of 2023, it could be devastating. And you're already starting to see the cracks begin to show with that ""Dune"" film delayed from November of this year to March of next year.And if you think about the box office theatrical release schedule, this is one of the most anticipated movies of the fall. Now that's gone. So you have to think that these theater chains, the box office in general, they're going to be strapped for a lot of those new content.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I was looking forward to seeing the sequel. I mean, the first one was a little bit long, but I was looking forward to seeing this. But if we're going to end up with like this drought--ALEXANDRA CANAL: A lot of long movies right now, ""Oppenheimer"".RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. That's true. But I guess we'll see how it all plays out in the fall and beyond. Appreciate that update. Our very own Alexandra Canal, thank you so much.]"

Magellan Midstream CEO Aaron Milford joins Yahoo Finance to discuss.""It will also add natural gas liquids and natural gas to that mix,"" Milford says on the company's investments in diversifying its natural gas assets. ""As you look forward, we feel very, very good about how powerful this company can be as an infrastructure company... And from a regulatory perspective, we have cleared the regulatory hurdles that we need to.""Milford also describes the opportunities and value that consolidation in the energy space offers amid the slow transition from traditional fossil fuel sources.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Magellan Midstream is betting big on natural gas as it pushes its $18.8 billion merger with ONEOK. The combination would result in the fourth largest US midstream company worth about $60 billion and is up for approval on September 21st.For more on this, we're joined by Aaron Milford, Magellan Midstream CEO. Good to have you on the show here. So talk about the timing of this. And obviously, any time you talk mergers, you have to wonder, how likely is this to catch the eye of regulators?AARON MILFORD: Well, sure. You know, it takes a little time to put deals like this together, that's for sure. And as we had the opportunity to consider this opportunity with ONEOK, it was really about two things. It was about maximizing value for our unitholders and then also thinking about the future, what best sets up our company going forward.So we're a refined products and crude oil business today primarily. It's a very healthy business. But when you think about the merger that we're creating, it'll be a refined products business, crude oil business. And then as you mentioned, it'll also add natural gas liquids and natural gas to that mix. So as you look forward, we feel very, very good about how powerful this company can be as an infrastructure company as we look forward.Story continuesAnd from a regulatory perspective, we've cleared the regulatory hurdles that we need to. And the vote that we have outstanding on the 21st is our last major hurdle.- And so as a combined entity, how immediately do you believe that you're ready to go hit the ground running? And what type of fine-tuning from an organizational perspective do you still think needs to take place?AARON MILFORD: Well, what's great is our business is a little different than their business. Refined products and crude oil, it's additive. They're complementary businesses. But they're different.So from an integration standpoint, we expect it to go very, very well. We'll bring our business into the mix. They'll continue to run their business really well.And then as we put the two companies together, we expect there to be significant synergies. So we expect about $200 to $400 million a year of value that will create from putting these two companies together that frankly, neither one of us do by ourselves. So that'll be the focus-- integrating, running our business really, really well from day 1, but then focusing on generating that additional value for all our unitholders and shareholders.- And it's interesting because this is a relatively fragmented industry in the US. What does having this consolidation in this space do? How does it position you against the competition?AARON MILFORD: So when you look at our space, it's been consolidating for a while. You've had a lot of smaller companies coming together to make larger companies. So as you look forward, it's all about having more ways to win. When you have a strong refined products business, a strong crude oil transportation business, and you add to that a strong natural gas liquids and natural gas business, you simply have more ways to win. So you have more ways to create growth and value for our investors moving forward.So energy transition is uncertain. And the more ways you can adapt, the better off you're going to be as a company. And this merger allows us to do that.- When we think about where things stand right now in terms of transitioning and the broader energy transition that is taking place, is this tie-up, is this deal in this ultimate merger a means to make sure that both of these businesses can not only complement each other, but at the end of the day, in this shift of and towards clean energy and cleaner elements of energy as well, that there's more of an opportunity for growth? And how do you kind look at tapping into that as well?AARON MILFORD: So energy transition-- the world needs all the energy they can possibly get. From our perspective, that's energy of all forms. That's fossil fuel energy. It's renewable energy. It's all of the above. That's what the world needs to have a successful economy.So as a fossil fuel company, we expect to have a very bright future in providing those fossil fuels the world's going to need. So as you look at that continuing demand in the world, it's all about getting those fossil fuels, natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, crude oil into that world market, not just our domestic market here in the US, but also the world market. And as we're able to do that, it creates opportunity because again, it comes right back down to, we believe, at the end of the day, we need all of the energy in all of its forms in order to be successful.]"

More than 20 counties in western and Central Florida have already issued evacuation orders.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled up $1.06, or 1.3%, at $81.16. The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 1.8%, after shedding 2.3% the week prior. Before that, it rose for seven weeks in a row in a rally inspired by Saudi-Russian production cuts that lifted WTI by nearly 20%.London-traded Brent settled up $1.07, or 1.3%, at $85.49 per barrel. Brent fell 0.4% last week, adding to the previous week’s 2.3% drop. Before that, the global crude benchmark also rose for seven weeks in a row, rising by a total of 18%.Concerns over slowing growth in China, the world’s largest buyer, have kept crude prices boxed at between $80 and $85 over the past month.Idalia threatens supply disruptionsBut the risk of storms hitting the U.S. Gulf Coast of Mexico could change that, analysts said.“The market is now vulnerable to spikes on the back of surprise outages and hurricane-related issues in the US,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“On the supply side, major producers appear committed to ensuring the market remains tight and prices higher. They had little success earlier in the summer but that is no longer the case.”U.S. oil major Chevron (NYSE:CVX) evacuated staff from three Gulf of Mexico oil production platforms ahead of the hurricane, wire reports said.Supply concerns were also heightened by a fire at a Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) refinery last week after a chemical leak ignited two giant storage tanks filled with naphtha.Story continuesOn Monday, Marathon said it planned to restart units at the 596,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, the third-largest in the United States.U.S. oil drillers were also cutting the number of rigs actively pulling crude out of the ground, indicating that production could further slow in coming months as the “supply squeeze is becoming more painfully obvious"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.But John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital pointed to the three-year highs in crude production estimated back-to-back over the past three weeks by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.“The missing words here are ‘production efficiency’, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the U.S. oil industry,” said Kilduff. “This industry is pretty dexterous when it comes to meeting demand. We will have adequate oil, I believe, despite the storms and that should prevent prices from getting out of hand because of the storms.”U.S. data deluge throughout weekSome traders maintain a somewhat outlook for oil this week ahead of an abundance of economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve at its next decision on U.S. interest rates on Sept. 20.U.S. job openings slowed their most in 2-½ years and consumer confidence plunged as well.A second reading on second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth is due on Wednesday, while readings on personal consumption expenditures inflation - the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge - are due on Thursday, and August nonfarm payrolls data are expected on Friday.FedChair Jerome Powell on Friday said a week ago that the U.S. central bank may need to raise rates further to cool stubborn inflation, which would potentially hit economic activity in the world’s largest economy, weighing on demand for crude.U.S. oil inventories awaitedMarket participants were also on the lookout Tuesday for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Aug. 25. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.921 million barrels, versus the 6.135M-barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug. 18.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus was for a build of 1.234M over the 1.467M increase in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a climb of 0.045M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.945M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesOil: First real uptick in 2 weeks from Hurricane Idalia threatOil rises 1% on softer dollar, US braces for hurricane hitTexas power grid operator issues energy conservation appeal for Tuesday]"

The release date for Dune: Part Two was pushed from November of 2023 to March of 2024. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses the strikes' impact on upcoming content and breaks down the areas where the studios and unions disagree.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the prolonged actors and writers strike continues to shake up the box office. Warner Bros confirmed that its film ""Dune: Part Two"", the sci-fi sequel starring Timothy Shamoley and Zendaya, is pushing back its release date as the strikes linger. For more on this story, we're joined by Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal. So, Allie, Barry Diller says the strikes needed to be settled by September 1st otherwise there won't be many movies for anyone to watch next year. So where do things stand now?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Well, Rachelle, things are still at a standstill at this point. And that's September 1st deadline I do think it's a relevant one. But rather it being a hard and fast line, I think it more so represents if writers are not working on new projects now, we're not going to be getting any new content come the new year. And that's going to drag revenues down across the board. And, you know, for the studio side, I think even compared to where we were a month ago, you're certainly seeing a little more urgency there.They're starting to really worry that that they're not going to have that content to aid subscribers and fuel that revenue growth. But there remains critical areas where the two sides just don't align. Number one being artificial intelligence and the use of AI in entertainment. The writers want to guarantee that studios won't use their scripts to train AI, whereas the studios don't want to set a precedent given how new this technology is and addition to the fact that they're saying they own the scripts. And then separately there are other issues like minimum staffing requirements. Studios are saying that should be up to the discretion of the head writer, and then streaming residuals.Story continuesAnother big sticking point writers want pretty hefty bonuses if their shows and movies do well on these streaming platforms. Seems like that should be the case. However, studios just simply don't have the cash to commit to what they want at this point. So a lot of unknowns, a lot of TBDs. There still seems to be a hefty amount of friction, and that's going to mean more economic losses down the line. Milken is saying that that 4 billion projection of losses, that could balloon to 5 billion. And, you know, we're only in a few months of this strike. If this continues through the end of 2023, it could be devastating. And you're already starting to see the cracks begin to show with that ""Dune"" film delayed from November of this year to March of next year.And if you think about the box office theatrical release schedule, this is one of the most anticipated movies of the fall. Now that's gone. So you have to think that these theater chains, the box office in general, they're going to be strapped for a lot of those new content.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. I was looking forward to seeing the sequel. I mean, the first one was a little bit long, but I was looking forward to seeing this. But if we're going to end up with like this drought--ALEXANDRA CANAL: A lot of long movies right now, ""Oppenheimer"".RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. That's true. But I guess we'll see how it all plays out in the fall and beyond. Appreciate that update. Our very own Alexandra Canal, thank you so much.]"

Also, longer device holding periods are reducing upgrade costs &amp; stabilizing churn.""The analysts say that the stocks' current valuations ""may be discounting more than full-remediation cost scenarios for lead, while anticipated updates could help to level and possibly narrow the perceived risk,"" referring to recent controversy borne of a Wall Street Journal report that the companies are using contaminating lead-covered cables, which could lead to high remediation costs.Verizon shares were gaining 1.4% to $34.02 in recent premarket trading. AT&amp;T was adding 1.6% to $14.43.3M earns an upgrade following $5.5 billion settlement reportsWolfe Research upgraded 3M (NYSE:MMM) to Peerperform from Underperform, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.Shares surged more than 5% yesterday following media reports that the industrial conglomerate has agreed to pay over $5.5B to resolve hundreds of thousands of lawsuits alleging that its earplugs sold to the U.S. military were defective.According to the reports, sources close to the matter say that the negotiations are ongoing and a final amount has yet to be decided. The potential settlement was first reported by Bloomberg News.Wolfe views the settlement amount “as good as could have been expected.”Story continuesThe remaining challenges are that there is still a highly uncertain event path, and we view the upcoming Healthcare spin as a catalyst for a dividend cut. Nevertheless, the stock finally screens as roughly fair value vs. our revised $76-140 bear/bull spread.Oracle gains on UBS upgradeOracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares rose more than 2% pre-market today after UBS upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $140.00 from $120.00.According to the bank, Oracle's shares have surged by 42% year-to-date, and they acknowledge that many investors already see Oracle as a winner in AI. However, UBS believes there's still significant room for Oracle's AI story to unfold. It pointed out several factors supporting this perspective. “a) we may be just one quarter into AI start-ups ramping their use of OCI, and we don’t think that Cohere has kicked-off its ramp yet; b) we are sitting in front of what could be a constructive CloudWorld event and Investor day” mentioned UBS.Furthermore, the firm noted the P/E multiple of 20x doesn’t look full on its estimates, as well as only a minority (around 40%) of sell-side analysts even rate Oracle shares a Buy.Mister Car Wash jumps 6% following Piper Sandler upgradeMister Car Wash (NYSE:MCW) shares rose more than 6% yesterday after Piper Sandler upgraded the company to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $12.00 from $9.00.This rating change is based on the anticipation of a significant upside to estimates over the next two years. Piper Sandler expects the company's rollout of Titanium 360 to contribute to around a 5% increase in comparable sales for both 2024 and 2025.The reduction in competitive openings in 2024 is also expected to ease pressure on Retail sales industry-wide.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”15. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is a major transportation company in the US.

(NASDAQ:INTU), a provider of software for small business accounting and tax preparation under the QuickBooks and TurboTax brands as well as personal finance (Credit Karma) and marketing services (Mailchimp). We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market.

(NASDAQ:MU) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Micron TechnologyThe Executive Vice President of Global Operations, Manish Bhatia, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$65.31. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 16% of Manish Bhatia's stake.Insiders in Micron Technology didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Micron Technology Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Micron Technology. In total, insiders sold US$6.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Micron Technology insiders own about US$175m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Micron Technology Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Micron Technology stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Micron Technology has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Several other major fast-food companies have taken the same step in recent years in response to probes by states.The plaintiffs were backed in their appeal by the Biden administration and the Democratic attorneys general of 20 states and Washington, D.C., who said in court briefs that McDonald's agreements illegally suppressed workers' wages.The 7th Circuit on Friday also said the district court judge should rethink his ruling declining to certify a nationwide class in the lawsuit. McDonald's has said the class could include millions of workers.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

It will be paid out on Oct 13 to shareholders on record as of Sep 29, 2023.Based on the increase, the annual dividend rate now comes to $5.08 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 2.9%, considering EastGroup’s closing price of $177.76 on Aug 25. Moreover, the company notes that projected total dividends per share for 2023 are expected to mark an increase of 7.2% over total dividends declared in 2022.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and quite encouragingly, EastGroup Properties is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. The company has hiked its dividend in each of the last 12 years, the recent one marking its 175th consecutive quarterly distribution to shareholders. Further, EGP increased or maintained its dividend for 31 consecutive years and hiked it for 28 years during this period.The stock looks attractive based on the regular rise in the dividend income amid a challenging environment. Now, let’s check out EastGroup Properties’ fundamentals and financial performance before taking any investment decision.This industrial REIT focuses on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties in major Sunbelt markets throughout the United States. With its focus on the ownership of premier distribution facilities usually clustered near major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets, EastGroup has a well-leased industrial portfolio. The company’s operating portfolio was 98.5% leased and 98.2% occupied as of Jun 30, 2023. Also, the average occupancy of the operating portfolio was 98.1% for the second quarter of 2023.EastGroup has a decent performance. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched on one occasion on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, the average surprise being 0.98%. Moreover, EastGroup Properties’ return on equity (“ROE”) is 8.04%, significantly higher than the industry’s ROE of 2.93%.Over the next five years, the company’s FFO per share is projected to grow at a rate of 6.90%. The favorable estimate revision for the ongoing year reflects an upbeat outlook for the company. It has moved 1.1% upward in the past month to $7.62, indicating 8.86% year-over-year growth.This industrial REIT churns cash flow of $7.80 per share compared with the industry’s average of $1.87. Its projected sales growth of 14.86% is higher than the industry’s average of 3.82%.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has been shooting up. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is anticipated to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including EastGroup, Prologis PLD and First Industrial Realty Trust FR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Particularly for EastGroup, we believe such deployment activity highlights the company’s operational strength and commitment to rewarding its shareholders handsomely. The latest hike reflects the company’s ability to generate solid cash flow growth through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio.In the last five years, EastGroup has increased its dividend six times, and the annualized dividend growth rate for this period is 15.03%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) Shares Could Be 29% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-110030462.html,1693306830,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Mondelez International fair value estimate is US$100Mondelez International's US$71.55 share price signals that it might be 29% undervalued The US$82.62 analyst price target for MDLZ is 18% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.21bUS$4.72bUS$5.16bUS$5.49bUS$5.78bUS$6.02bUS$6.24bUS$6.44bUS$6.62bUS$6.80bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 6.43%Est @ 5.15%Est @ 4.25%Est @ 3.62%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$174bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$174b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$96bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$137b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$71.6, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mondelez InternationalStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

VinFast (VFS) shares have extended gains since its IPO debut two weeks ago. Hostess Brands (TWNK) is reportedly exploring a sale amid takeover interest from General Mills (GIS), Mondelez International (MDLZ), PepsiCo (PEP), and Hershey (HSY). Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at some of the leading industry headlines after Monday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: XPeng, the stock, closing up just about 5%. Now the company announcing a $744 million deal with Didi. And the Chinese car maker is now going to work on an electric car for launch next year. That's a partnership here with the Didi. And that's going to give obviously you would think XPeng a little bit more exposure.This is going to be cars, Akiko, targeting the mass market. Maybe the thought here is also it could potentially help some of those investor concerns that we know it is a very, very competitive EV landscape within China right now. Obviously, lots of competition, but XPeng reaching this deal with Didi maybe it'll give them a leg up, maybe a bit of an edge against some of their competitors within the space.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, it really points to just so how hyper competitive that market is becoming over in China. You talk about this new launch or new mass market vehicle. They're looking at launching a roughly 20,500 or 20,600 I should say is the price tag. So at a lower price point, as they look at where the market is right now, remember XPeng also took some investments in from Volkswagen. Took a 5% stake in the company as well.To me, the interesting part is the partnership on the other side, which is Didi. As you know, this ride hailing company was at one point, trying to develop their own robotaxis and EVs. But as we know, since the IPO, things have been very bumpy for this company. So we'll see how this all fares. But XPeng getting a lift on the back of that.Story continuesWell, sticking with the electric vehicle market, VinFast shares riding higher and now the company has a bigger market cap than yes, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis combined. Seana, combined. And remember, we were talking about this company, Vietnamese company that is really boldly trying to compete in the US market at a lower price point.I mean, guess there is an argument to be made that because of the limited number of shares that are trading, things have been a little choppy or a little more exaggerated in terms of the moves. But it has been an incredible run in a very short amount of time. I don't know.It's hard to say where this is all going to go because we have seen what happens-- what has happened in the past at least with some of these SPACs, these upstart EVs that have come to market through SPAC.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Akiko, we also have to keep in mind this is a money losing EV startup right there. Certainly, is a lot of excitement. I think you're exactly right to point out the fact that it's a very, very, very small amount of shares that are available right now. So that leaves this stock prone to wild swings to volatility.We certainly have seen that play out since it did go public earlier this month. But we can take into account the valuation, near $200 billion, like you said, more than many of the large automakers combined, certainly looks a bit out of step with the fundamentals when you take a look at this business, it certainly has attracted retail investor attention.I was looking today, it's one of the most watched names on Stocktwits, so it really points maybe to some of the volatility in the wild swings that we have seen within the space and that maybe no surprise that is then attracting some interest from retail traders.But the fact that this is now what, the third largest automaker in the world behind Toyota and Tesla, it's pretty incredible. I don't think many people would have expected that when it went public.AKIKO FUJITA: No, Seana, by the way, it's worth noting in terms of numbers of VinFast EVs, just 137 registered cars in the US. Obviously, they're going for scale in the US. But, I mean, for a car company that is valued at what it is, pretty incredible.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly incredible. We'll see likely a lot of volatility ahead you would think in that name.All right. Well, we are also watching shares of Hostess Brands. The stock jumping on a report that the company is considering putting itself up for sale. Reuters saying that it's fielding takeover interest and among those interested-- General Mills, Mondelez International, PepsiCo, and Hershey. We're looking at gains of just about 2%. And also some analysts, Akiko, weighing in today.Evercore's David Palmer saying that on a possible deal. Maybe it would be attractive for some of the other players that we just mentioned there. They have a sustainable, profitable growth. Relatively attractive sweet baked goods category. So this could be an attractive target for some of the larger names within this space. And we know Hostess Brands has been struggling with its business now for over a decade.AKIKO FUJITA: I know we're talking about the business side of things for Hostess, but I mean, you know, I was thinking about this story. I can't remember the last time I had a Twinkie.SEANA SMITH: No.AKIKO FUJITA: And I have been told by those like Brooke DiPalma that the quality is much, much better now. But I don't know. I have not tried one in years. SoSEANA SMITH: I was going to say, I think there's a word for that. I don't know if I'm buying it, though.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, obviously a Twinkie or Hostess, I should say, looking for other buyers in the market. We're going to be watching that space really closely. It'll be interesting to see how this all shakes down.]"

Van de Put told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this year he is on the hunt for more snack deals with his robust, cash-rich balance sheet.A deal for Hostess likely isn't imminent, but the company has reportedly retained Morgan Stanley to run point on the process.Shares of Hostess Brands surged 22% on Friday's session. The stock has tacked on another 2% in early trading on Monday.""We do not to comment on rumors or speculation,"" a spokesperson for Hostess told Yahoo Finance via email.The addition of Hostess to any of those larger food brands makes strategic sense, pros say.""We see potential for sustainable, profitable growth in the sweet baked goods,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer in a client note today.To that end, Hostess has delivered 11% organic sales growth since 2018 despite the food industry playing up healthier snacking options in the zero-sugar category.Palmer added that Hostess could provide an acquirer a national footprint in the sweet treats category with an enviable 14% market share. Cost synergies also exist, as do ""significant"" revenue synergies, as a larger entity could unleash cross-selling opportunities.And lastly, Palmer thinks Hostess has become a much better operator since Callahan took over in May 2018.The company has bolstered its marketing, acquired cookie maker Voortman's, and boosted innovations with products such as Bouncers and Kazbars.Story continues""Today, we believe Hostess is capable of sustainable long-term sales growth of 3%+ and operating profit growth of +5-7%,"" Palmer said.The analyst estimates that fair value for Hostess in any deal would be $34 a share, about 24% above current trading levels.Hostess Twinkies and CupCakes on a store shelf on May 17, 2021, in San Anselmo, Calif.

285,19904354-12be-3d2d-8dad-22eb6c5ff989,OXY,2023-08-29,Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-seems-140013712.html,1693231213,STORY,"['OXY', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum What Is Occidental Petroleum's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Occidental Petroleum had debt of US$19.1b at the end of June 2023, a reduction from US$22.0b over a year. However, it does have US$486.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$18.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Occidental Petroleum's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$7.15b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$34.6b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$486.0m and US$2.85b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$38.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesThis is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$54.7b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Occidental Petroleum has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.1. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 10.9 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Occidental Petroleum if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 21% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Occidental Petroleum can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last two years, Occidental Petroleum recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 96% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewOccidental Petroleum's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. There's no doubt that its ability to to convert EBIT to free cash flow is pretty flash. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Occidental Petroleum's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Ulta Beauty:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.44 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$5.2b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Ulta Beauty has an ROCE of 44%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty roceIn the above chart we have measured Ulta Beauty's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Ulta Beauty here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?The trends we've noticed at Ulta Beauty are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 44%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 63%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Key TakeawayAll in all, it's terrific to see that Ulta Beauty is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 57% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

However, there are notable analysts and experts who believe the economy is not out of the woods yet and we can face a recession in late 2023 and 2024. Bears believe we are yet to see the real effects of rising interest rates. They say tech stocks have gone too far when it comes to valuations, beyond justifiable levels. Talking to Bloomberg, Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO), recently said the he believes there could be recession ""running perhaps deep into next year” driven by the problems in the real estate industry, inflation and related market factors.Answering a question about the Federal Reserve’s claim that it has cleared the recession hurdle, Grantham said that the Fed’s record is not impressive in this area and it has never called a recession especially the ones following bubbles. Grantham said that the Fed has taken credit for inflating bubbles and inflating asset prices but they have never taken credit for the disinflationary effects of asset prices breaking. Grantham believes the recession he’s warning about may start in 2023.Recession Delayed not CancelledJeffrey Klingelhofer, co-head of investments and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, voiced similar concerns talking to Bloomberg recently. The analyst said that recession in the US is delayed, not cancelled. He said the economic indicators are reaffirming his expectations and there’s nothing surprising. Loan conditions are tightening, consumer spending is slowing and “sentiment wildly deteriorating.” He said that the world is emerging from a low inflationary environment to a high inflationary environment and that’s why changes are not taking places very quickly and the real effects of inflation and rate hikes are taking time to play out.Story continuesKlingelhofer also pointed to the slowdown in China and its effects on the global markets. He said that China’s growth is slowing and it’s aligned with the rest of the world which is also face serious economic challenges.In this backdrop, wise investors are looking for defensive plays that are expected to grow despite recession risks.Stocks That Will Always GrowPhoto by Tech Daily on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first picked stocks that are market leaders in their industries, enjoying a near monopoly status.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market.

The utilities under the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry control miles of underground pipeline network to provide natural gas services to the customers. The rising demand for clean, burning natural gas will create more opportunities for natural gas distribution companies.Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, with its widespread transmission and distribution lines and interstate pipelines, and significant investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2023-2024 time frame. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in crucial production regions should drive the performance of  MDU Resources Group MDU, Sempra Energy SRE and NewJersey Resources NJR.About the IndustryThe shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature steadily boost demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural gas distribution pipelines are vital in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 2.3 million miles of underground distribution pipelines. Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and rising investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean energy sources can lower demand for natural gas and, consequently, for pipelines.Factors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryAging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may disrupt services. Natural gas distribution utilities currently provide services to over 80 million customers in the United States. Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. Per Playbook.Aga.org, the natural gas utilities invest nearly $32 billion each year to improve the distribution network's safety.  To lower the possibility of service interruption, the Department of Energy announced $33 million in funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing cast iron and bare steel pipes. The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile. Currently, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years.Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow to 103 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2023 and increase 1.06% year over year to 104.1 Bcf/d in 2024. The increase in gas production volumes has improved from earlier forecasts of EIA due to strong volumes from the Permian region. Export volumes are expected to increase in 2023 and 2024, providing much relief to natural gas transporters. EIA expects U.S. gross liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase nearly 12% year over year to 11.9 Bcf/d in 2023, and exports are expected to increase 12.2%  to 13.31 Bcf/d in 2024.  Per the Playbook.AGA.org the United States will reach peak export capacity of 20 Bcf/d by 2025. This indicates the need for more pipelines to send the LNG to the export terminals.Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States are driving demand for natural gas. The distribution network will continue to transport natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. With three new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals. Per EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. Per the  Playbook.AGA.org, one residential customer signs up for natural gas service every minute and 80 businesses add natural gas service each day. As production and demand for natural gas increase, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the commodity to end-users.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12.

Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 3.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.36 per share, indicating a change of +9.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.94 indicates a change of +12.5% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $91.43 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $367.83 billion and $391.73 billion estimates indicate +13.5% and +6.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.7%. EPS of $6.14 for the same period compares with $5.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +3.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

(NASDAQ:ADP) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-ownership-shares-automatic-data-130033607.html,1693227633,STORY,['ADP'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Automatic Data Processing implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Automatic Data Processing, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Automatic Data Processing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Automatic Data Processing's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Automatic Data Processing. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$163m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Automatic Data Processing. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Automatic Data Processing better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

However, there are notable analysts and experts who believe the economy is not out of the woods yet and we can face a recession in late 2023 and 2024. Bears believe we are yet to see the real effects of rising interest rates. They say tech stocks have gone too far when it comes to valuations, beyond justifiable levels. Talking to Bloomberg, Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO), recently said the he believes there could be recession ""running perhaps deep into next year” driven by the problems in the real estate industry, inflation and related market factors.Answering a question about the Federal Reserve’s claim that it has cleared the recession hurdle, Grantham said that the Fed’s record is not impressive in this area and it has never called a recession especially the ones following bubbles. Grantham said that the Fed has taken credit for inflating bubbles and inflating asset prices but they have never taken credit for the disinflationary effects of asset prices breaking. Grantham believes the recession he’s warning about may start in 2023.Recession Delayed not CancelledJeffrey Klingelhofer, co-head of investments and managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, voiced similar concerns talking to Bloomberg recently. The analyst said that recession in the US is delayed, not cancelled. He said the economic indicators are reaffirming his expectations and there’s nothing surprising. Loan conditions are tightening, consumer spending is slowing and “sentiment wildly deteriorating.” He said that the world is emerging from a low inflationary environment to a high inflationary environment and that’s why changes are not taking places very quickly and the real effects of inflation and rate hikes are taking time to play out.Story continuesKlingelhofer also pointed to the slowdown in China and its effects on the global markets.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.

(NYSE:DHI)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-d-r-140032833.html,1693231232,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$131 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$106. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether D.R. Horton's current trading price of US$115 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at D.R. Horton’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton What Is D.R. Horton Worth?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that D.R. Horton’s ratio of 7.99x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 8.34x, which means if you buy D.R. Horton today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe that D.R. Horton should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that D.R. Horton’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will D.R. Horton generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 0.2% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for D.R. Horton, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DHI’s growth outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DHI? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DHI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into D.R. Horton, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for D.R. Horton you should be aware of.If you are no longer interested in D.R.

The DOT alleges that on 43 flights, American Airlines kept passengers on planes during long delays without giving them the opportunity to exit. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the implications for the airline.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right. Well, let's take a look at another trending ticker that we're watching. American Airlines is getting hit with a $4.1 million fine from the US Department of Transportation, saying the airline kept passengers on planes dozens of times without the opportunity to exit during delays.Now, this is the largest fine an airline has faced from the department since the implementation of guidelines for extended ground delays were enforced about 10 years ago.And, Brad, so this is about the amount of time that they keep people sitting on the tarmac, not giving people a chance to deplane. So good news for-- good news for consumers who are perhaps looking for some recourse, missing connecting flights. You have a lot of airline staff who have sort of once they're off the clock, you might have to deplane and get on another plane. A win for the consumer even though the dollar amount doesn't seem super significant.BRAD SMITH: Well, here's what's even more interesting about this. Earlier this year, American Airlines had actually implemented kind of an AI-generated rebooking type of system and add on to their service, where if it looked like you weren't going to make your next flight or your connecting flight, that they would automatically rebook you hoping to kind of cut down on the amount of time that people had to spend in lines trying to rebook through customer service, time spent on phones, and so forth.And so now this enters the larger question of, OK, so how many of the passengers were actually missing flights because not only were they being held on the tarmac or sitting on that flight or the plane and American Airlines keeping them on that flight and them not being able to make that connection, but then on the other side, also having to wait it for a longer period of time to ultimately make their connection because they were automatically rebooked as well.So it's kind of a confluence of both the operation that they had changed up, as well as what is being discovered here today with this $4.1 million fine for the ground delays as well.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And some of that was offset because some of that about 2.05 million was credited to the airline for some of the compensation that they did already give to some people who did have their flights impacted. But a small number, but it is that warning shot that the regulators are paying attention to this. So potentially we'll see-- might see more action. It might put more of these airlines on notice as well.]"

Most delays occurred at Dallas Fort Worth Airport. The tarmac delays affected a total of 5,821 passengers.“This is the latest action in our continued drive to enforce the rights of airline passengers,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. “Whether the issue is extreme tarmac delays or problems getting refunds, DOT will continue to protect consumers and hold airlines accountable.”American told USDOT these delays were the result of exceptional weather events, and that the flights represented less than 0.001% of the approximately 7.7 million flights operated by American and its regional partners during the period of 2018 to 2021.""We have since apologized to the impacted customers and regret any inconvenience caused,"" the airline said on Monday.The airline said it has committed ""substantial time and resources to improve its performance on tarmac delays.""While accepting this compromise settlement ""American respectfully disagrees that certain of these tarmac delays warrant enforcement action under the extreme circumstances presented,"" it added.In 2016, USDOT fined American Airlines a then record-matching $1.6 million after it found the carrier had allowed a number of domestic flights to remain on the tarmac without allowing passengers an opportunity to get off the plane.Story continuesUSDOT in January said it planned to seek higher penalties from airlines and others that broke consumer protection rules, saying they were necessary to deter future violations.The department has fined numerous airlines in recent years, including a $135,000 penalty on British Airways over a 2017 tarmac delay in which it failed to ensure the timely deplaning of passengers.(Reporting by David Shepardson and Paul Grant; Editing by Rami Ayyub and Bill Berkrot)]"

There are exceptions in which airlines are allowed to bend the rules, including for safety and security reasons, but the department said none of those were factors in the flights it identified.“This is the latest action in our continued drive to enforce the rights of airline passengers,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who vowed to hold airlines accountable under consumer-protection laws.According to the consent order, American said it seeks to avoid any lengthy ground delays, but the 43 flights represented a tiny fraction of 1% of the roughly 7.7 million flights that American and American Eagle operated between 2018 and 2021.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 3.21% so far this year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.26%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.57% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.36%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.98 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.20%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options.

(NYSE:FCX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-freeport-mcmoran-130014130.html,1693227614,STORY,['FCX'],"[Key InsightsFreeport-McMoRan's estimated fair value is US$45.88 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityFreeport-McMoRan's US$38.33 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimateOur fair value estimate is similar to Freeport-McMoRan's analyst price target of US$45.76Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.39bUS$7.15bUS$7.91bUS$6.04bUS$5.04bUS$4.48bUS$4.17bUS$3.99bUS$3.90bUS$3.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -16.60%Est @ -10.97%Est @ -7.04%Est @ -4.28%Est @ -2.35%Est @ -1.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$5.0kUS$6.1kUS$6.2kUS$4.4kUS$3.4kUS$2.8kUS$2.4kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$65bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$65b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$30bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$66b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$38.3, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Freeport-McMoRan as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.209. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Freeport-McMoRanStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

(NASDAQ:PEP) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 29th of September to $1.26. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.8%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. At the time of the last dividend payment, PepsiCo was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 122% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 54.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 59%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.historic-dividendPepsiCo Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.15, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $5.06. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.9% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.PepsiCo's Dividend Might Lack GrowthInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that PepsiCo has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. EPS has been growing at a reasonable rate, although with most of the profits being paid out to shareholders, growth prospects could be more limited in the future.Our Thoughts On PepsiCo's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for PepsiCo that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

VinFast (VFS) shares have extended gains since its IPO debut two weeks ago. Hostess Brands (TWNK) is reportedly exploring a sale amid takeover interest from General Mills (GIS), Mondelez International (MDLZ), PepsiCo (PEP), and Hershey (HSY). Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at some of the leading industry headlines after Monday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: XPeng, the stock, closing up just about 5%. Now the company announcing a $744 million deal with Didi. And the Chinese car maker is now going to work on an electric car for launch next year. That's a partnership here with the Didi. And that's going to give obviously you would think XPeng a little bit more exposure.This is going to be cars, Akiko, targeting the mass market. Maybe the thought here is also it could potentially help some of those investor concerns that we know it is a very, very competitive EV landscape within China right now. Obviously, lots of competition, but XPeng reaching this deal with Didi maybe it'll give them a leg up, maybe a bit of an edge against some of their competitors within the space.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, it really points to just so how hyper competitive that market is becoming over in China. You talk about this new launch or new mass market vehicle. They're looking at launching a roughly 20,500 or 20,600 I should say is the price tag. So at a lower price point, as they look at where the market is right now, remember XPeng also took some investments in from Volkswagen. Took a 5% stake in the company as well.To me, the interesting part is the partnership on the other side, which is Didi. As you know, this ride hailing company was at one point, trying to develop their own robotaxis and EVs. But as we know, since the IPO, things have been very bumpy for this company. So we'll see how this all fares. But XPeng getting a lift on the back of that.Story continuesWell, sticking with the electric vehicle market, VinFast shares riding higher and now the company has a bigger market cap than yes, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis combined. Seana, combined. And remember, we were talking about this company, Vietnamese company that is really boldly trying to compete in the US market at a lower price point.I mean, guess there is an argument to be made that because of the limited number of shares that are trading, things have been a little choppy or a little more exaggerated in terms of the moves. But it has been an incredible run in a very short amount of time. I don't know.It's hard to say where this is all going to go because we have seen what happens-- what has happened in the past at least with some of these SPACs, these upstart EVs that have come to market through SPAC.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Akiko, we also have to keep in mind this is a money losing EV startup right there. Certainly, is a lot of excitement. I think you're exactly right to point out the fact that it's a very, very, very small amount of shares that are available right now. So that leaves this stock prone to wild swings to volatility.We certainly have seen that play out since it did go public earlier this month. But we can take into account the valuation, near $200 billion, like you said, more than many of the large automakers combined, certainly looks a bit out of step with the fundamentals when you take a look at this business, it certainly has attracted retail investor attention.I was looking today, it's one of the most watched names on Stocktwits, so it really points maybe to some of the volatility in the wild swings that we have seen within the space and that maybe no surprise that is then attracting some interest from retail traders.But the fact that this is now what, the third largest automaker in the world behind Toyota and Tesla, it's pretty incredible. I don't think many people would have expected that when it went public.AKIKO FUJITA: No, Seana, by the way, it's worth noting in terms of numbers of VinFast EVs, just 137 registered cars in the US. Obviously, they're going for scale in the US. But, I mean, for a car company that is valued at what it is, pretty incredible.SEANA SMITH: Yes, certainly incredible. We'll see likely a lot of volatility ahead you would think in that name.All right. Well, we are also watching shares of Hostess Brands. The stock jumping on a report that the company is considering putting itself up for sale. Reuters saying that it's fielding takeover interest and among those interested-- General Mills, Mondelez International, PepsiCo, and Hershey. We're looking at gains of just about 2%. And also some analysts, Akiko, weighing in today.Evercore's David Palmer saying that on a possible deal. Maybe it would be attractive for some of the other players that we just mentioned there. They have a sustainable, profitable growth. Relatively attractive sweet baked goods category. So this could be an attractive target for some of the larger names within this space. And we know Hostess Brands has been struggling with its business now for over a decade.AKIKO FUJITA: I know we're talking about the business side of things for Hostess, but I mean, you know, I was thinking about this story. I can't remember the last time I had a Twinkie.SEANA SMITH: No.AKIKO FUJITA: And I have been told by those like Brooke DiPalma that the quality is much, much better now. But I don't know. I have not tried one in years. SoSEANA SMITH: I was going to say, I think there's a word for that. I don't know if I'm buying it, though.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, obviously a Twinkie or Hostess, I should say, looking for other buyers in the market. We're going to be watching that space really closely. It'll be interesting to see how this all shakes down.]"

Van de Put told Yahoo Finance Live earlier this year he is on the hunt for more snack deals with his robust, cash-rich balance sheet.A deal for Hostess likely isn't imminent, but the company has reportedly retained Morgan Stanley to run point on the process.Shares of Hostess Brands surged 22% on Friday's session.

Cost synergies also exist, as do ""significant"" revenue synergies, as a larger entity could unleash cross-selling opportunities.And lastly, Palmer thinks Hostess has become a much better operator since Callahan took over in May 2018.The company has bolstered its marketing, acquired cookie maker Voortman's, and boosted innovations with products such as Bouncers and Kazbars.Story continues""Today, we believe Hostess is capable of sustainable long-term sales growth of 3%+ and operating profit growth of +5-7%,"" Palmer said.The analyst estimates that fair value for Hostess in any deal would be $34 a share, about 24% above current trading levels.Hostess Twinkies and CupCakes on a store shelf on May 17, 2021, in San Anselmo, Calif.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now. The investment landscape is continuously evolving this year. It started with the rise of tech stocks. Seven large tech companies represented over two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's growth until July. However, this months-long rally stumbled in August and the excitement of consistently witnessing investment profits has faded away. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 3.82% in the past 30 days, while it returned 30.84% year-to-date. In this volatile environment dividend stocks continue to gain investors' attention.Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks with Over 8% YieldInvestors focus on dividend stocks to increase the overall returns of their investment portfolio by using the dividends to buy more shares. The other reason for adding these stocks to portfolios is to create income for retirement. Instead of reinvesting dividends, retirees could use them as a source of spending money. Essentially, dividend stocks could replace the need for holding cash or bonds. Companies that have sufficient cash flow to consistently pay dividends usually pose lower risks due to their naturally more stable financial performance. Furthermore, the dividend itself can act as a safety net against potential losses.According to a report by Morningstar, during economic slowdowns that began in July 1981, March 2001, and December 2007, dividend-paying stocks performed better than the overall market. Moreover, in two out of these three periods, their outperformance was quite notable. The report also mentioned that companies with continuous dividend growth streaks tend to outperform the overall market. In the trailing 5 years through July 31, 2022, the dividend growth strategy delivered an annualized return of 9.93%, compared with a 7.56% return of income strategy. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks as these companies have been raising their payouts for decades.Story continues16 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now Photo by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked the top 16 dividend stocks, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend-paying stocks among hedge funds as of the second quarter of 2023.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”15.

We see a clear path to upside earnings revisions as the company expands new products that increase its total addressable market and drive average revenue per user growth.”13. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy now. The American pharmaceutical company has a 138-year run of paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders and also holds a 9-year streak of dividend growth. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.82%, as of August 25.Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was a popular stock among hedge funds at the end of Q2 2023 as 87 funds owned stakes in the company, growing from 72 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $5 billion.Baron Funds mentioned Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs in oncology, diabetes, Alzheimers, immunology, and other diseases. Shares climbed due to continued investor excitement around novel weight loss drugs in the GLP-1 class, including Lilly’s Mounjaro. Given demand that is orders of magnitude more than supply, the full potential of the GLP-1 class of drugs remains unclear, with sales projections eclipsing $100 billion. This number would set a new industry record by a large margin. Drug development in this space is understandably fierce, and as recently as late June, Eli Lilly revealed new data from its diabetes/obesity pipeline assets that will further enhance the value proposition offered to patients. We retain conviction.In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment continues to be in Eli Lilly and Company. Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is on track to be FDA approved for obesity in 2023. At a medical conference in June, Lilly announced Phase 2 clinical data for a next-generation obesity drug called retatrutide, which showed the drug achieved up to 17.5% mean weight loss at 24 weeks in adults with obesity and up to 24.2% mean weight loss at 48 weeks. Lilly also announced Phase 2 clinical data showing its once daily oral drug orforglipron achieved up to 14.7% mean weight loss at 36 weeks in adults with obesity. The results from these pipeline obesity medicines confirmed Lilly’s status as a market leader in the diabetes and obesity category. Also during the quarter, Lilly announced that its drug Donanemab slowed cognitive and functional decline in a Phase 3 study in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”12. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is an American financial services company that offers a range of investment, wealth management, and banking services to its consumers.

The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4 billion.An investment management firm, Mairs &amp; Power mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Notable detractors to performance in the first half were US Bank (USB), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which were down 22.09%, 31.65%, and 8.65%, respectively. Charles Schwab was also caught up in the banking selloff in March. The company’s earnings will likely be pressured in the near term from lower deposit balances and higher-cost funding, but we believe these headwinds will eventually abate. In the meantime, the company continues to take share from its competitors thanks to its low-cost position.”11. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market.

Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits.

340,a25c48d6-21af-3370-b65e-13ac9e728dbf,DGX,2023-08-29,3 Pharma Stocks to Buy as Summer COVID Cases Spike,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-pharma-stocks-buy-summer-091120389.html,1692781880,STORY,"['CVS', 'PFE', 'DGX']","[Covid-19 related stocks started spiking again this week. Driven primarily by reports about new variants and increasing spread. This news has been a shot in the arm for some struggling pharma stocks. Shares of the four biggest Covid vaccine manufacturers are down 20% since January but began ticking upward again on the news.Already pharmaceutical companies are creating, manufacturing and distributing boosters to target new variants. Likewise, the Biden administration is urging Americans to get boosters in an effort to slow or stop the spread as we enter cooler weather and collectively migrate indoors, a trend that’s long been associated with increased illness rates. No matter the details, Covid and its variants are now endemic, and something we’ll likely live with indefinitely. For investors, the pervasive nature of the illness may represent opportunity.CVS Health (CVS)The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stockSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is down nearly 30% this year, but this healthcare retailer represents a quality long-term play that’ll likely see a Covid-19 related boost. CVS is one of the go-to testing sites offering drive-through diagnostics for Covid. The company runs more than 4,800 testing centers and vaccination at nearly 10,000 sites. Both testing and vaccination rates have fallen since 2022. Last year, the company ran 32 million tests and administered almost 60 million vaccines.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLikewise, CVS’ share price fell alongside Covid’s decline, but this new surge may push the stock back up.CVS is a value play for long-term investors, too. Ranked at #6 on the Fortune 500 list, CVS’ retail and integrated healthcare network services more than 100 million customers. 85% of Americans live within 10 miles of a CVS, further reinforcing the company’s national market penetration. And, while waiting for a stock reversal, investors can take advantage of a comprehensive company commitment to returning shareholder value. The company’s dividend yield is 3.5%, and in 2022 the firm returned more than $795 million to investors in distributions.Story continuesQuest Diagnostics (DGX)Quest Diagnostics Patient Service Center in San Francisco Bay AreaSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comQuest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX), renowned for its diagnostic testing expertise, hasn’t been meeting the post-pandemic projections set by analysts. The company’s CEO pointed out that a recent dip in earnings was primarily attributed to a sharper-than-anticipated decrease in Covid revenues. That may soon change with a surge in Covid-19. In Q1 2022, the company generated almost $600 million in testing revenue. That sales sweep fell to a paltry $199 million over the same period in 2023. At the same time, it’s worth noting that Quest’s fundamental operations remain resilient, with a 10% increase in revenue from its main, non-Covid business segments. Quest is on a steady recovery trajectory in the grand scheme independent of Covid-19’s return. The leadership foresees a consistent 2% annual revenue growth up to 2024. Further bolstering its market position is an enhanced testing arsenal, now enriched with state-of-the-art AI capabilities.Like CVS, Quest has substantial upside potential beyond Covid. And a surge in testing demand may provide a quick booster to ailing stock prices while it’s core operational revenue catches up.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comAn obvious Covid-19 play is Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). But, just because it’s obvious, doesn’t mean investors should underestimate its potential. The pharma giant’s already seen a share price jump on recent Covid news. But a quick, short-term climb likely won’t be the only benefit Pfizer sees. Pfizer’s newest booster shot already shows promise in addressing the newest variants. Those new variants represent almost 20% of new cases assessed between July 23rd and August 5th. Rising cases indicate a climb that Pfizer is well-suited to capitalize on. Alongside variant increases, hospitalization rates jumped 40% from June’s low. When Pfizer rolls out its vaccine in September, there will likely be a demand jump from those nervous about variants.Of course, Pfizer remains a strong pharma play beyond Covid. The company has 90 drugs in its pipeline, with many in the latter half of testing required before going to market. Pfizer is here to stay, and its terrible stock performance since January isn’t indicative of its long-term potential.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

This is because these companies are usually reinvesting back in the business in order to grow. As the companies mature and profits become more stable, distributing dividends can be a method with which to reward shareholders.Dividends can help an investor to create a steady stream of income, but can also be a sign the company is in excellent financial shape. Financially strong companies are often favored by investors as they can prosper in good times and perform better during periods of economic adversity. Therefore, they have the potential to produce better returns for their shareholders over long periods of time.Criteria for tech companies paying dividendsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with CSCO. Click here to check it out. CSCO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CSCOThis discussion will examine two technology names that meet the following criteria:Have a financial strength rating of at least 8 out of 10 from GuruFocus.Trade at or below their GF Value.Yield at least 2.5%.Have a GF Score of at least 85 out of 100.Overview of Cisco SystemsFirst up is Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), a leading provider of routers and switches used to connect networks around the world through the internet. It is estimated that the vast majority of the data transmitted over the internet has been through the companys products over the last three decades. Cisco generates approximately $57 billion in annual revenue and has a market capitalization of more than $228 billion.Cisco Systems receives an 8 out of 10 for financial strength from GuruFocus.Financial strength and dividend growthCisco generally rates very well against its peer group in most areas. Its best showing is on debt-to-Ebitda, which tops 76% of companies in the hardware industry. Debt-to-equity is also easily ahead of most of its competitors. The company benefits from a massive cash position on its balance sheet, $26 billion as of the most recent quarterly report, which gives it one of the better cash-to-debt ratios in the industry and provides interest coverage that comes in ahead of two-thirds of its peer group.Story continuesWhere Cisco does struggle is the equity-to-asset ratio, which is below 69% of the companys peer group. That said, the company's other rankings are also near the high end of its 10-year history. This shows that not only is Cisco outperforming its competition, it is performing at decade highs for the company.The Piotroski F-Score, which measures financial strength, is an 8 out of 9 and the companys Altman Z-Score, which measures the chances a company could go bankrupt, is considered safe. Additionally, Cisco is especially good at generating returns on invested capital as the ROIC is 15.9%. This is above the companys weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.Having a strong financial position, along with an enviable cash balance, has allowed Cisco to raise its dividend for 13 consecutive years. This is one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the tech sector. The expected payout ratio for this fiscal year is just 39%. Shares yield 2.8%, well above the average yield of 1.6% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.GF Score and valuationAn impressive showing on financial strength, along with excellent scores for profitability, momentum and growth, offset by a low score on value, have resulted in a GF Score of 88 out 100 for Cisco Systems. This implies the company could see higher returns moving forward based on GuruFocus research.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsShares of Cisco Systems trade very close to its GF Value. The stock trades at $56 presently, slightly ahead of its GF Value of $54.95. With a price-to-GF Value ratio of 1.02, it receives a rating of fairly valued from GuruFocus.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsOverview of Skyworks SolutionsThe second technology stock to consider is Skyworks Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), which is a semiconductor company that creates, develops and sells its products around the world. The companys products are used in a variety of end markets, such as automotive, smartphones, defense and the connected home. The company has annual sales approaching $5 billion and is valued at nearly $17 billion today.Skyworks Solutions also receives an 8 out of 10 rating for financial strength.Financial strength and dividend growthAdmittedly, the company does not rank as high against the competition as Cisco Systems does. Skyworks Solutions best metric is the equity-to-asset ratio, where it is ranked higher than 60% of companies in the semiconductor industry. On the reverse side, the cash-to-debt score is lower than 80% of its peer group. This has occurred as the company has greatly increased the presence of debt on its balance sheet in recent years. The companys ratios for debt-to-equity, debt-to-EBITDA and interest coverage are all middle of the pack.These scores should begin to improve as Skyworks Solutions' cash flows continue to grow. For example, the most recent quarter saw a record year-to-date operating cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. The company ended the third quarter with $722 million in cash, which was used aggressively to pay down its debt by $500 million during the period.As cash flow generation has improved, so too has Skyworks Solutions ability to pay and raise its dividend. Shareholders have received a dividend increase for 10 consecutive years. Dividend increases are likely to continue as the expected payout ratio for fiscal year 2023 is just 30%. Shares offer a yield of 2.6%.Skyworks Solutions Piotroski F-Score is somewhat lower at 6, but still within a safe range. The companys Altman Z-Score, on the other hand, is near the top of the safe range. The company is also very good at turning invested capital into profits as the ROIC of 15.2% is ahead of its WACC of 9.7%. Altogether, these metrics speak to the safety of the companys financial position.GF Score and valuationSkyworks Solutions does not just receive a solid score for financial strength, but in all areas that make up the GF Score ranking. In fact, the company has at least an 8 out of 10 for all five components. This leads to an excellent GF Score of 95 out of 100, implying the potential for outsized returns.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsThe stock trades at a discount to its GF Value by a wide margin at $105. With a GF Value of $135.57, Skyworks Solutions has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.77. Reaching the GF Value would represent a return of 29%. Factor in the dividend and the total return stretches into the low 30% range. The stock is rated as modestly undervalued by GuruFocus.2 Financially Strong Tech Names With Market-Beating YieldsFinal thoughtsWhile many companies in the technology sector do not pay dividends, there are names that do. These companies must be on firm financial footing to do so, otherwise their ability to grow and further fund the dividend could be at risk.Cisco Systems and Skyworks Solutions are two companies that have strong financial strength scores that have made it possible for dividends to be distributed to shareholders. Both names have high GF Scores and market-beating yields. While Cisco trades near its GF Value, Skyworks could provide high returns.Investors looking for financially strong tech names paying dividends should consider adding these two stocks to their watchlists.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the stock market performance, head directly to Top 10 Dow Stocks: Ranked By Hedge Fund Bullishness Index. Dow 30 is a stock index that takes into consideration the performance for 30 large-scale public companies. For many investors and economists, Dow 30 reflects on the performance of the United States economy. Over the past year, economists were skeptical about the US economy in 2023. In 2022, the consumer price index rose up to 9.1%. The Federal Reserve was expected to introduce an aggressive monetary policy to counter such rising levels of inflation. For its 2023 outlook, Goldman Sachs predicted the below-potential growth and the labor market to bring down inflation. Although Goldman Sachs forecasted a 35% chance of a recession within the next 12 months, this figure was adjusted to 25% in June 2023. Despite the challenges for this year, the stock market in July has showcased its best performance in 26 years. According to CNN, this surge was spearheaded by the performance of tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Following the latest buzz and hype around artificial intelligence, tech companies are big on innovation, research, and development for related applications. As per Refinitiv Lipper, over 80% of the 292 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported higher earnings than the market consensus. As inflation gradually stabilizes, the market experts seem optimistic for a soft landing. Initially, the Federal Reserve had calculated a 71% probability for a recession during this year. Although the economy still faces recessionary pressure, the probability is not considered as high as initial estimates. In contrast to the estimates for 2023, the S&amp;P 500, coupled with the Nasdaq Composite, experienced the 5th consecutive positive month in July. The S&amp;P 500 rose over 19% during the first 7 months of 2023. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 7%, while the Nasdaq Composite grew by 44% by July this year. This can be attributed largely to the performance of tech companies. Story continuesAs per Forbes, the Federal Reserve’s ability to suppress inflation more than market expectations is the leading factor for such remarkable market performance. As of June 2023, the consumer price index had decreased to roughly 3%. While the Federal Reserve is targeting a long-term CPI rate of 2%, this decrease came quicker than expectations. Additionally, the labor market added over 209,000 jobs in June. In addition to this, the GDP growth rate was reported at 2.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, consumer discretionary products experienced the largest growth in earnings during the second quarter, with a 36% increase in the EPS for the same time last year. However, despite the performance of the stock market, analysts have not ruled out an increase in inflation and unemployment heading into 2024. Investors looking for safe haven assets during uncertain economic conditions usually flock towards the stocks tracked by benchmark indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). Our MethodologyWe have sorted the 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.
