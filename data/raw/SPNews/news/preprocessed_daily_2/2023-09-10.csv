We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$150b last week after a 3.0% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 0.7% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Texas Instruments' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Texas Instruments. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Texas Instruments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Texas Instruments. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Texas Instruments Incorporated in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$184m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Texas Instruments. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .Ultimately the future is most important.

The dividend yield will be 5.7% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 39%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 9.9%. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 47% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.16 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.62. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Huntington Bancshares has impressed us by growing EPS at 5.4% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Huntington Bancshares' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Huntington Bancshares that you should be aware of before investing.

While bettors debate which team will win the Super Bowl this year, the companies providing the markets for most of those wagers are duking it out for customers.DraftKings (DKNG) and FanDuel had more than 75% of the market through the end of the first quarter of this year, per analysis from Macquarie research. But two of sports business's premier brands, ESPN and Fanatics, are entering the gambling world, setting the stage for a fall that could once again be defined by heavy promotions.DraftKings, for its part, says it isn't worried about the competition.""We've seen this in pretty much every digital product in existence, the best product wins,"" DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins told Yahoo Finance. ""On the internet, it's easy to compare. People talk and they see. I think that we really invested there, and I think at this point in time we're the best product in the market and it's only going to get better.""Destabilizing the landscapeOn Aug. 8, Penn Entertainment ditched Barstool Sports and signed a $2 billion deal with ESPN, the self-proclaimed worldwide leader in sports. Penn is aiming to launch ESPN Bet in November and hopes the new brand can earn it double-digit market share, up from its current low-single-digit share.Penn CEO Jay Snowden said at an industry conference this week that Penn is now operating its own tech stack and believes the company has ""great product,"" which could be a meaningful development with primetime ESPN exposure expected to draw more eyes to the app. Meanwhile, Fanatics has a massive database of sports fans and their favorite teams from years of order placements. The company sends targeted emails to sell merchandise around team events. It could leverage a similar strategy with online gambling and promote bets to customers based on their favorite teams.Story continues""I think there's a real opportunity to do some things differently in the category, some things that look a lot more like a consumer technology company and a lot less like a sportsbook,"" Matt King, CEO of Fanatics Betting &amp; Gaming, told Yahoo Finance.King spent nearly six years at FanDuel, including almost four as CEO, before leaving in the fall of 2021. He likens the new approach he's taking with Fanatics to American Express, where customers pay year after year to be a part of the reoccurring rewards program. The e-commerce giant is currently offering a free jersey to any Massachusetts user that bets $50 or more on the platform. It also plans to integrate its collectibles business and build out fan experiences where bettors can interact with players.""The question for the Fall is will PENN's launch of ESPN Bet (and Fanatics' launch too) destabilize what was a rationalizing competitive landscape,"" Shaun Kelley, Bank of America research analyst, wrote in a research note on Tuesday.Macquarie Securities managing director Chad Beynon, who covers the sports gambling space, believes DraftKings and FanDuel have long been the market leaders with the most visually appealing platform and the best selection of betting options.""The big question is, that gap is probably going to close with the others, but will people transition over?"" Beynon said.FedEx Field Opens the first Fanatics Sportsbook betting lounge inside an NFL Stadium on Jan. 20, 2023. (mpi34/MediaPunch/IPX) (mpi34/MediaPunch/IPx)Return of promotions?The heightened competition raises the question of whether companies will double down on promotions that previously hurt their margins.""Let's say we get to week five or six of the NFL season and people aren't happy with their market share or how they're stacking up,"" said Joel Simkins, a managing director in Houlihan Lokey's technology group. ""Do we see those marketing wars kind of remerge, do we some more aggressive re-engagement activities?""Promotions have been the flashy way to bring bettors onto an app. At their best, companies use them to bring new customers onto a platform with the hopes to retaining bettors long term.At their worst, promotions play out like Caesars (CZR) 2021 New York launch, which offered $3,000 deposit matches but failed to maintain customers. Caesars Digital, which includes the sportsbook, lost $560 million in net income during the quarter it launched in New York. Its market share in New York decreased from 24% in February 2022 to just under 10% in August 2023, per New York State Gaming Commission Data. The industry has improved its margins this year. FanDuel achieved profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis through the first half of 2023. DraftKings cut losses throughout 2023, recently announced quarterly profits, and is aiming for full-year profitability in 2024.But if either Fanatics or ESPN Bet is successful, another customer acquisition moment might heat up in the sports gambling space and could threaten the progress gambling companies have made toward profitability.""The easiest way to grow, and even frankly, defend share at times is marketing [which includes promotions],"" King said. ""But ... the longer you do that, the more there's a compounding effect in kind of just the business strategy, that kind of makes you continually dependent on spending billions of dollars in marketing to maintain that share position.""""Once you scale marketing it's like a drug that's hard to get off of.""Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

PetroChina, China's largest oil and gas producer, was in 23rd place, while Chinese offshore oil and gas firm CNOOC had the highest ranking at 20th.None of the Chinese state-owned oil and gas companies, along with all those on the list except for Italian energy company Eni, fulfilled the minimum requirements to align with the Paris Agreement, according to Carbon Tracker.According to Sinopec's reduction targets for greenhouse-gas emissions, published on its website, it aimed to reduce 12.6 millions tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during the 2018-to-2023 period. However, in its 2022 sustainability report released in March, it said it had already reduced 19.68 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions as of the end of 2022.PetroChina has set a goal to reduce operational emissions to ""near-zero"" emissions by around 2050, according to its 2022 environmental, social and governance (ESG) report, released in March.Meanwhile, CNOOC has set targets to achieve a cumulative reduction of more than 577,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023, ramping that up to 1.5 million tonnes by 2025, according to its 2022 ESG report in April.In order for a company's emissions target to be potentially aligned with the Paris Agreement, it must include full life-cycle emissions, target net-zero by 2050 on a full life-cycle basis with absolute interim goals, and cover emissions from the company's own production and product sales on a full-equity share basis, including downstream product sales from third-party crude, according to Carbon Tracker's report.Saudi Aramco has set a net-zero target for its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions - those generated directly by companies' own facilities or indirectly through externally bought energy, respectively - but only for ""wholly owned operated assets"".""Saudi Aramco is the only company in our universe to restrict emissions reductions to wholly owned operated assets, which is a narrower definition of operated assets that excludes those that may be co-owned by other investors,"" Climate Tracker's report said. ""As such, it brings up the rear.""CNOOC, Sinopec, PetroChina, Saudi Aramco and Eni did not immediately reply to the Post's requests for comments.Oil and gas majors have been returning more capital to their shareholders than they have been reinvesting in low-carbon areas, according to Bain &amp; Company's Global Energy and Natural Resources report, released on Thursday.In the oil and gas sector, only 43 per cent of capital was reinvested for growth in 2022, down from 58 per cent in 2018, according to the report, compiled by Bain from S&amp;P Capital IQ data on 75 of the top energy and natural resources firms by market capitalisation in each sector as of April 2023.According to Bain's early 2023 survey of more than 600 executives across the global energy and natural resources sectors, the top barriers to decarbonisation were concerns around the return on investment and customer's willingness to pay, chosen by 78 per cent of respondents.""Energy transition ambitions demand record-setting investment in many sectors, and so far, capital expenditure is significantly lagging,"" said Joe Scalise, global head of Bain's energy and natural resources practice, in a statement.""Far from this being an issue of 'dry powder' or capital availability, it's an issue of customer value, willingness to pay, and the ability of policymakers and regulators to set the rules of the game to generate sufficient returns.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Perdana Petroleum Berhad (KLSE:PERDANA) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Perdana Petroleum Berhad:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.061 = RM47m ÷ (RM868m - RM90m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Perdana Petroleum Berhad has an ROCE of 6.1%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 9.9%. Check out our latest analysis for Perdana Petroleum Berhad roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Perdana Petroleum Berhad's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of Perdana Petroleum Berhad, check out these free graphs here.So How Is Perdana Petroleum Berhad's ROCE Trending?There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Perdana Petroleum Berhad. The company has consistently earned 6.1% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 58% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.On a side note, Perdana Petroleum Berhad has done well to reduce current liabilities to 10% of total assets over the last five years. Effectively suppliers now fund less of the business, which can lower some elements of risk.Story continuesThe Bottom LineLong story short, while Perdana Petroleum Berhad has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. And with the stock having returned a mere 25% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Perdana Petroleum Berhad that you might find interesting.While Perdana Petroleum Berhad may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

But while it has ticked up slightly, the level remains near 40-year lows at about 350 million barrels. That's less than half of the all-time highs from 2010 and about 40% below where it was when the withdrawals began.Strategic Petroleum ReserveEnergy Department""America's SPR is the largest in the world and stands ready to deliver on its mission to respond to future supply disruptions, providing relief when needed most,"" a spokesperson for the Energy Department said in a statement to Insider.But the department didn't specifically address questions on whether the Biden administration plans fresh withdrawals and how much scope the SPR has for additional drawdowns.Another US stockpile of oil comes from commercial inventories, which sit at 416.6 million barrels. But that source tends to be more volatile than the SPR and has dropped 21% from a year ago.Meanwhile, Brent crude prices recently hit a 10-month high, having jumped more than 20% since late June, and US gasoline prices hit their highest summertime levels in over a decade, even as the driving season has ended.That came as Saudi Arabia and Russia announced they would prolong their oil production cuts for another three months until December.Story continuesThe stock market has started to feel the ripple effects from rising oil prices. With prices for crude and refined fuels shooting up, investors are growing more concerned that inflation could re-accelerate after more than a year of slowing down.And that could force the Federal Reserve to keep benchmark rates higher for longer, or even raise them further.For now, the SPR looks to be a non-factor. Last month, the Biden administration canceled plans to add 6 million barrels back in the reserve, saying the price of oil at the time didn't offer taxpayers a good deal. Prices have since continued to march higher.And Congress nixed its earlier plans to sell 140 million barrels from the SPR over the next three years in a spending bill that was passed in December.To be sure, the US can also pump plenty of oil. It became the world's biggest oil producer over the last two decades as the shale boom unlocked huge volumes in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota.But the Energy Department recently estimated that the top US shale regions will continue pumping less oil this month, after hitting a record high in July.And over the longer term, the productive capacity of shale wells is looking less robust. Research firm Enverus recently said that the natural drop-off rate in a well's output is much steeper than originally thought. So oil companies must drill new wells at a faster clip just to keep output steady.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

(NYSE:MSI) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-motorola-solutions-inc-120432867.html,1694347472,STORY,['MSI'],"[Readers hoping to buy Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Motorola Solutions' shares before the 14th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.88 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.52 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Motorola Solutions stock has a trailing yield of around 1.2% on the current share price of $282.5. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Motorola Solutions paying out a modest 38% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Motorola Solutions generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 37% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Motorola Solutions's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Motorola Solutions has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Motorola Solutions? Motorola Solutions has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.In light of that, while Motorola Solutions has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Motorola Solutions has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.29 = US$89b ÷ (US$412b - US$104b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 9.2%. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Microsoft compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Microsoft.So How Is Microsoft's ROCE Trending?Microsoft is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 29%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 54% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.Our Take On Microsoft's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Microsoft   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

While the company avoided being broken up in the legal battle, which centred around its dominance of the PC market, the years of litigation have been cited as a key reason why the company missed out on a new generation of technology such as internet search, social media and smartphones.This week, starting on Tuesday, a courtroom in Washington DC will host the biggest tech monopoly case since the US government came close to breaking up Microsoft a quarter of a century ago. Its subject is Google, one of the companies that took the innovation crown from Gates’ business.Bill Gates' reputation took a hit in the late 1990s after a recording of his deposition in a monopoly court case were made public - JESSICA PERSSON/AFP via Getty ImagesWhy is Google on trial?Google is being sued by the US Justice Department under the same 19th century law used to go after Microsoft, and is accused of using similar tactics. In this case, prosecutors allege that the company used a web of illegal deals to freeze out competitors to its search engine, cementing its own vice-like grip over the web.The agency is seeking an order forcing Google to stop its behaviour, but a judge could go as far as a breakup of the company.Like Microsoft at the turn of the millennium, Google is also reckoning with a changing tide in the tech industry. For the first time in decades, its search engine is under threat, not from a traditional competitor, but from artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT that could replace the cascade of links that Google’s search engine offers with concise and precise answers.Story continuesThe US case against Google is the culmination of more than a decade of growing regulatory pressure against the company, which last week celebrated its 25th birthday.The European Union has repeatedly fined Google billions of euros and ordered it to make changes to its constellation of services, from price comparison to its Android phone software and internet advertising business.The UK’s competition regulator has launched multiple investigations into the company, and forced it to make changes to its web browser.The US case was first launched almost three years ago under the Trump administration but has been taken forward by Biden’s Justice Department. The case gets to the gravitational centre of the company’s power: its all-conquering search engine.How did Google break antitrust laws?The Justice Department argues that Google’s dominance – accounting for nine in 10 search queries in the US – is not the result of having the best search engine, but the consequence of a series of exclusivity agreements signed with phone manufacturers and software makers that made it the primary search engine for almost all consumers and froze out potential rivals.“It’s not about the tech anymore, it’s about the moat they put around themselves,” says Colin Hayhurst, who runs the British search engine Mojeek. “It’s the fact they have these agreements with the other big players.”In particular, the Justice Department’s case zeroes in on a deal with Apple to be the iPhone browser’s default search engine, a contract believed to be worth up to $15bn (£12bn) a year.According to the complaint, one Apple employee told their Google counterpart: “Our vision is that we work as if we are one company.”The regulatory focus on Google's search prevalence on iPhones has drawn in deputies of Apple boss Tim Cook - Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple has produced more than on million pages of evidence to prosecutors. Three executives, all of whom report directly to chief executive Tim Cook, are scheduled to appear in the witness box after the iPhone maker lost an attempt to block legal demands that they testify. (Apple says it makes Google the main search engine on its phones because it considers it to be the best on the market, not because of the billions that flow the other way as a result.)Google’s top lawyer, Kent Walker, has called the case “deeply flawed” and says people use its search engine “because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives”.The trial is scheduled to take just over two months, with a string of high-powered decision makers, including Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai, expected to give evidence.The American government’s chances of success are unclear. The courts have been dealt a series of setbacks to efforts to rein in Big Tech. Regulators’ attempts to block deals such as Microsoft’s purchase of games company Activision Blizzard and Meta’s purchase of virtual reality company Within have been overruled.Last week, a group of US states that had sued Google for breaking monopoly laws with its app store, settled with the company. The terms of the deal were kept private.Google chief Sundar Pichai is expected to give evidence when the US Justice Department's case goes to court - Kyle Grillot/BloombergMaurice Stucke, a former Justice Department prosecutor and law professor at the University of Tennessee, says the outcome of the case is hard to call.“The problem today is that the courts are a moving target and it’s very hard to predict how they will rule,” he says. “There haven’t been many monopolisation cases brought by the agency, the last really was the Microsoft one.”What happens if Google loses the antitrust trial?Even if the Justice Department’s case ultimately fails, it may not matter. The barrage of evidence and testimony will be its own form of punishment. Gary Reback, one of the government lawyers who took on Microsoft in the Nineties, is fond of saying “the trial is the remedy”, meaning the public scrutiny itself is punishment enough.Google’s lawyers have attempted to prevent the case from being broadcast over Zoom, which opponents say is an attempt to suppress the amount of attention it receives.Meanwhile, the distraction of a major court case is also likely to have an impact on day-to-day operations.Former Microsoft executives say its own battle with the US government meant the company became bureaucratic and slow, with every product update having to go through layers of legal reviews before it would be released to the public.Google’s case comes as its search engine faces a growing threat from AI. The company has declared an internal “code red” over the rise of ChatGPT. Engineers have warned that the company has “no moat” against the rise of free, open source models, and many of its AI experts have quit, citing a stuffy culture that impedes innovation.Even if Google wins its battle with the US government, the encounter may do lasting damage.Shivaun Raff, the co-founder of the price comparison service Foundem, who has campaigned against Google in Europe for over a decade, says of the US court battle: “This is the first step. I believe that there’s several arrows in their quiver, but it’s only just getting started.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

19,e6d646e5-cbd7-3a24-9599-e38b4d679cd9,MSFT,2023-09-10,Artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT was built in Iowa — with a lot of water,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-technology-behind-chatgpt-131421138.html,1694265261,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The cost of building an artificial intelligence product like ChatGPT can be hard to measure.But one thing Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed for its technology was plenty of water, pulled from the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers in central Iowa to cool a powerful supercomputer as it helped teach its AI systems how to mimic human writing.As they race to capitalize on a craze for generative AI, leading tech developers including Microsoft, OpenAI and Google have acknowledged that growing demand for their AI tools carries hefty costs, from expensive semiconductors to an increase in water consumption.But they’re often secretive about the specifics. Few people in Iowa knew about its status as a birthplace of OpenAI's most advanced large language model, GPT-4, before a top Microsoft executive said in a speech it “was literally made next to cornfields west of Des Moines.”Building a large language model requires analyzing patterns across a huge trove of human-written text. All of that computing takes a lot of electricity and generates a lot of heat. To keep it cool on hot days, data centers need to pump in water — often to a cooling tower outside its warehouse-sized buildings.In its latest environmental report, Microsoft disclosed that its global water consumption spiked 34% from 2021 to 2022 (to nearly 1.7 billion gallons, or more than 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools), a sharp increase compared to previous years that outside researchers tie to its AI research.“It’s fair to say the majority of the growth is due to AI,” including “its heavy investment in generative AI and partnership with OpenAI,” said Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside who has been trying to calculate the environmental impact of generative AI products such as ChatGPT.In a paper due to be published later this year, Ren’s team estimates ChatGPT gulps up 500 milliliters of water (close to what’s in a 16-ounce water bottle) every time you ask it a series of between 5 to 50 prompts or questions. The range varies depending on where its servers are located and the season. The estimate includes indirect water usage that the companies don’t measure — such as to cool power plants that supply the data centers with electricity.Story continues“Most people are not aware of the resource usage underlying ChatGPT,” Ren said. “If you’re not aware of the resource usage, then there’s no way that we can help conserve the resources.”Google reported a 20% growth in water use in the same period, which Ren also largely attributes to its AI work. Google’s spike wasn’t uniform -- it was steady in Oregon where its water use has attracted public attention, while doubling outside Las Vegas. It was also thirsty in Iowa, drawing more potable water to its Council Bluffs data centers than anywhere else.In response to questions from The Associated Press, Microsoft said in a statement this week that it is investing in research to measure AI's energy and carbon footprint ""while working on ways to make large systems more efficient, in both training and application.”“We will continue to monitor our emissions, accelerate progress while increasing our use of clean energy to power data centers, purchasing renewable energy, and other efforts to meet our sustainability goals of being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030,” the company's statement said.OpenAI echoed those comments in its own statement Friday, saying it's giving “considerable thought"" to the best use of computing power.“We recognize training large models can be energy and water-intensive"" and work to improve efficiencies, it said.Microsoft made its first $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI in 2019, more than two years before the startup introduced ChatGPT and sparked worldwide fascination with AI advancements. As part of the deal, the software giant would supply computing power needed to train the AI models.To do at least some of that work, the two companies looked to West Des Moines, Iowa, a city of 68,000 people where Microsoft has been amassing data centers to power its cloud computing services for more than a decade. Its fourth and fifth data centers are due to open there later this year.“They’re building them as fast as they can,” said Steve Gaer, who was the city's mayor when Microsoft came to town. Gaer said the company was attracted to the city's commitment to building public infrastructure and contributed a “staggering” sum of money through tax payments that support that investment.“But, you know, they were pretty secretive on what they’re doing out there,” he added.Microsoft first said it was developing one of the world's most powerful supercomputers for OpenAI in 2020, declining to reveal its location to AP at the time but describing it as a “single system” with more than 285,000 cores of conventional semiconductors, and 10,000 graphics processors — a kind of chip that's become crucial to AI workloads.Experts have said it can make sense to ""pretrain"" an AI model at a single location because of the large amounts of data that need to be transferred between computing cores.It wasn't until late May that Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, disclosed that it had built its “advanced AI supercomputing data center” in Iowa, exclusively to enable OpenAI to train what has become its fourth-generation model, GPT-4. The model now powers premium versions of ChatGPT and some of Microsoft's own products and has accelerated a debate about containing AI's societal risks.“It was made by these extraordinary engineers in California, but it was really made in Iowa,” Smith said.In some ways, West Des Moines is a relatively efficient place to train a powerful AI system, especially compared to Microsoft's data centers in Arizona that consume far more water for the same computing demand.“So if you are developing AI models within Microsoft, then you should schedule your training in Iowa instead of in Arizona,"" Ren said. ""In terms of training, there’s no difference. In terms of water consumption or energy consumption, there’s a big difference.”For much of the year, Iowa's weather is cool enough for Microsoft to use outside air to keep the supercomputer running properly and vent heat out of the building. Only when the temperature exceeds 29.3 degrees Celsius (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit) does it withdraw water, the company has said in a public disclosure.That can still be a lot of water, especially in the summer. In July 2022, the month before OpenAI says it completed its training of GPT-4, Microsoft pumped in about 11.5 million gallons of water to its cluster of Iowa data centers, according to the West Des Moines Water Works. That amounted to about 6% of all the water used in the district, which also supplies drinking water to the city's residents.In 2022, a document from the West Des Moines Water Works said it and the city government “will only consider future data center projects"" from Microsoft if those projects can “demonstrate and implement technology to significantly reduce peak water usage from the current levels” to preserve the water supply for residential and other commercial needs.Microsoft said Thursday it is working directly with the water works to address its feedback. In a written statement, the water works said the company has been a good partner and has been working with local officials to reduce its water footprint while still meeting its needs.—-O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.——The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing agreement that allows for part of AP's text archives to be used to train the tech company’s large language model. AP receives an undisclosed fee for use of its content.]"

You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-macys-nyse-m-upcoming-121432079.html,1694261672,STORY,['M'],"[Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Macy's' shares on or after the 14th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.17 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.66 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Macy's has a trailing yield of approximately 5.6% on its current stock price of $11.81. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Macy's's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Macy's can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Macy's Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Macy's is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (58%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Macy's's 12% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Macy's has seen its dividend decline 1.9% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see.To Sum It UpIs Macy's an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Its earnings per share have been declining meaningfully, although it is paying out less than half its income and more than half its cash flow as dividends. Neither payout ratio appears an immediate concern, but we're concerned about the earnings. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.If you're not too concerned about Macy's's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. For example - Macy's has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

(NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-zoetis-inc-110030189.html,1694343630,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Key InsightsZoetis' estimated fair value is US$190 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityZoetis' US$186 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$218 analyst price target for ZTS is 14% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Zoetis The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$2.69bUS$3.12bUS$3.42bUS$3.64bUS$3.84bUS$4.00bUS$4.15bUS$4.28bUS$4.41bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 6.59%Est @ 5.26%Est @ 4.32%Est @ 3.67%Est @ 3.22%Est @ 2.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$113bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$113b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$62bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$87b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$186, the company appears about fair value at a 2.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ZoetisStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Pharmaceuticals industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

If it’s something that is swimming against the tide of society, it’s for the society to rise up and change the law and then we can move on this.” He added that MasterCard was “very strong” on privacy.Such an approach will serve Haythornthwaite, 66, well in his new job as chairman of NatWest Group after the bank was plunged into a crisis over the botched closure of Nigel Farage’s accounts.The row over his debanking began in June after Coutts, which is owned by NatWest, said it would close the former Brexit campaigner’s account with little notice. It was later revealed that the private bank shut Farage’s accounts because his views did not align with the bank’s “values” and were at odds with its “position as an inclusive organisation”.Dame Alison Rose, NatWest’s chief executive, was then forced to resign in July after admitting to being the source of an inaccurate BBC story that Farage’s Coutts account had been closed for commercial reasons.NatWest boss Dame Alison Rose was forced to resign after admitting to being the source of an inaccurate BBC story about Nigel Farage - Nicholas.T.Ansell/PALast week, Haythornthwaite, a City veteran with the sobriquet “Slick Rick”, was picked to steer the 40pc taxpayer-owned bank out of its current storm and into calmer waters. He will join the board in early January before succeeding Sir Howard Davies as chairman next April.The task will not be straightforward. In his first few months in the job, the Oxford-educated Brit must oversee the appointment of Dame Alison’s permanent successor as chief executive. He will also need to quickly mend relations between the bank and the Government – its largest shareholder – after ministers were left furious by the Farage debanking scandal.Story continuesGary Greenwood, a banking analyst at Shore Capital, says: “[Haythornthwaite]’s biggest job will be finding a suitable new CEO.“After that, it is about trying to keep all stakeholders happy, which is not an easy task when NatWest is in the spotlight even more than most banks due to it still having around 40pc government ownership.”His appointment has been approved by both the Treasury and the City watchdog, with the former confident that Haythornthwaite will be able to steady the ship at NatWest.Haythornthwaite, who studied at both Queen’s College, Oxford and MIT, spent most of his career at BP, rising up the ranks to manage the largest oilfield in the North Sea, Magnus.He went on to run a series of businesses ranging from cement to engineering before running the boards of some of Britain’s most high-profile businesses, including British Gas-owner Centrica, Ocado and Network Rail.A government source says: “Rick has over two decades of experience leading some of the biggest commercial companies and is a widely respected choice to chair one of the UK’s largest banks.”While he has a wealth of experience, his tenures have not always been straightforward. He was accused by union bosses of presiding over a “gravy train” at Network Rail after approving a £2.4m bonus pot for directors in 2010.It came despite then transport secretary Philip Hammond urging Haythornthwaite to show “restraint” on bonuses. Hammond had written a letter to the then Network Rail chair urging him to “display a sensitivity to the wider economic climate”.Haythornthwaite has run the boards of some of Britain’s most high-profile businesses, including Centrica, Ocado and Network Rail - DANIEL JONESHaythornthwaite also faced a backlash over pay at Centrica and was criticised by a prominent shareholder advisory group for holding too many board positions at once.Some in the City were surprised that NatWest did not pick someone with banking experience. While Haythornthwaite holds an advisory position at investment bank Moelis, he has never worked at a high street lender.Greenwood says: “I’m a bit surprised they have not gone for someone with more banking experience.“That said, it’s hard to find candidates that aren’t tarnished by the past, so perhaps having an experienced non-banker has its attractions.”Besides recovering from the debanking scandal, other issues the City veteran will have to contend with include: the declining use of cash, with NatWest coming under fire in recent months after imposing new limits on cash deposits and withdrawals; branch closures; and helping to manage the Government’s sale of its remaining stake in the bank.Under current plans, the Treasury intends to offload its 38.8pc holding in NatWest by the end of 2026.In an interview with consulting giant McKinsey in 2020, NatWest’s incoming chairman outlined what boards want from their executives during times of crisis.Haythornthwaite said: “Boards need CEOs who can handle multiple truths, who can be expansive in thinking, and who can live comfortably in the future and bring the company along for the ride.”He added that “boards still want to sleep… we like to sleep soundly at night”. After a restless few months, sentiments like this will be warmly welcomed by NatWest’s directors.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model created by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968. It predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotMarathon Digital Holdings focuses on mining digital assets.

This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. Additionally, the EBIT to Total Assets ratio (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings might be a potential value trap, considering its low Altman Z-Score and other risk factors.

If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$46.27 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$41.00). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, Wells Fargo insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$109m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Wells Fargo and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Cannabis producers like Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) often raise investor caution due to their historical volatility. The modest market response to the significant announcement of Tilray’s takeover of the remaining 57.5% stake in Truss Beverage, a Molson Coors Canada (NYSE:TAP) subsidiary, is surprising.The Acquisition of Truss BeverageOn August 18, Tilray acquired the remaining 57.5% of Truss Beverage from Molson Coors. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis move aims to expand Tilray’s customer reach. CEO Irwin Simon previously mentioned Tilray’s pursuit of acquisitions in the spirits and beverages sector. The acquisition enhances Tilray’s market standing and streamlines sales and distribution.Tilray invested considerable capital into this beverage brand, aiming for mainstream THC-based drinks. Focusing mainly on Canada, Tilray can test and refine formulations for potential U.S. recreational legalization.Tilray continues to diversify into alcohol and cannabis drinks, acquiring brands from Molson Coors and Anheuser-Busch. This aligns with their move beyond traditional cannabis. Tilray previously purchased eight beer and beverage brands for $85 million from Anheuser-Busch, gaining prominence in U.S. craft beer. As a top cannabis company, Tilray holds a $1.79 billion market cap, specializing in beverages and wellness products, ranking fifth in U.S. craft beer.Tilray’s Truss acquisition is part of a diversification strategy amid slow North American cannabis growth. As the sector expands, Tilray focuses on THC beverages and craft beer, aiming to lead Canada’s adult-use cannabis beverage market with a 36% share.The company hopes that these cannabis-infused beverages will provide the kind of growth and profitability investors expect.The margins in the cannabis game are increasingly shrinking, as this product sees most of the gains go to the government as taxes and retailers, suppliers, distributors and the myriad of other companies that touch the product on the way to the end consumer.Story continuesIf Tilray can have greater control over this process and become an end to end player in this nascent market, the hope is that the company’s fundamentals will improve over time.In July, Tilray’s premium brand RIFF launched sparkling THC beverages (Blue Raspberry Ice and Wild Raspberry Lemonade) with natural flavors. Fast-acting nano-emulsified THC ensures rapid effects for a delightful experience, ideal for solo or social occasions.Blair MacNeil, the company’s Canada President, announces RIFF’s introduction of cannabis beverages, diversifying its Canadian offerings. The Blue Raspberry Ice flavor offers a refreshing, nostalgic berry experience, available individually with 10mg THC in Alberta and Ontario.What NowTilray Brands is primed for substantial growth as a leader in Canadian recreational cannabis, even amid regulatory challenges. Diversification efforts through alcohol and beverage acquisitions in the past year enhance its prospects.That said, Tilray is leveraging its position in the emerging cannabis beverage sector while strengthening investor confidence. Cannabis-infused beverages are a high-growth area. However, it’s unclear exactly how big this market will be, and just how profitable this endeavor will be out of the gate. For now, I’ll remain on the sidelines and see if this deal can shift the company’s fundamentals in the favor of investors. For now, I think the jury is still out.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

When you think of dexterous professions, you often think of doctors or musicians. You may not think of scientists, but scientists need to be as dexterous as they come. Science requires consistency, and that in turn requires incredible precision with samples and data. In the life sciences, we often work on the scale of microliters, which is 1 5-thousandth the volume of a teaspoon. And a difference of 1 microliter can mean the difference between a Nobel Prize-worthy discovery and just another failed experiment.Handling and moving volumes that small requires a lot of manual dexterity. Yet scientists aren’t selected for dexterity; there’s no hands-on test to get into a PhD program. And for many of us, being incredibly precise all day, everyday is a tall and perhaps impossible order. Consistency can also be hard to keep up after a long day of repetitive motion.But that’s where robotics are changing the research game. The best labs of today are already equipped with robotic systems to dispense reagents precisely, at exact volumes, over and over again. In the labs of tomorrow, it’s likely every process will be automated this way. These robots are tireless, consistent, and have far greater precision than any human could. That makes them a huge productivity multiplier, and makes ever more sensitive experiments possible.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe leading robo-lab companies are among the biggest in the industry. It’s no secret that robots are the future, and thus the future of research robotics is bright. And when these robots take over the lab, as they once took over the assembly line, these robo-lab company stocks will stand to benefit the most.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) is the proverbial 600 pound gorilla of biotechnology and laboratory supplies. Their comprehensive range of products and services spans every facet of laboratory science. From cutting-edge machines to essential reagents, nearly every lab buys Thermo Fisher products. So it’s no surprise that they’re also one of the biggest suppliers of lab robots and among the leading robo-lab company stocks.Story continuesOne of the standout innovations in Thermo Fisher’s impressive arsenal is the F7 robot system. The F7 combines the robust performance of an industrial robot with the precision needed in a lab. This robot enables the seamless execution of numerous manual tasks. That enhances efficiency and frees up researchers to focus on more intellectual aspects of their work. Thermo Fisher offers a number of robotic tools, but the F7 is just one example of how wide-ranging these tools can go. It can do so many of the hand movements a researcher can do.Furthermore, Thermo Fisher is bringing automation to cell culture systems. Growing human cells in a lab to test drugs and procedures is a critical component in biological research and drug discovery. Automating this process eliminates much of the tedious labor involved, streamlining workflows and reducing human error.With Thermo Fisher providing robotic sample handling systems for any occasion, they magnify their strengths. Their extensive product portfolio covers nearly everything a lab could ever buy. And so Thermo Fisher can tailor their robots and products to work very well together. That ensures that when you want a Thermo Fisher robot, you’ll likely buy Thermo Fisher products to go with it.Automation has been the future ever since the industrial revolution, and now it’s coming to labs. Thermo Fisher promises to be on the crest of that wave as a leading robo-lab company.Azenta (AZTA)scientist wearing virtual reality headset interacts with futuristic holographic interface showing neurological dataSource: Gorodenkoff / ShutterstockAzenta (NASDAQ:AZTA) is a laboratory and clinical diagnostic that is bringing the robo-revolution to both businesses. They have developed a diverse array of cutting-edge automation tools to increase accuracy, reproducibility, and precision.At the heart of Azenta’s offerings is their prowess in automating sample and liquid handling. Their systems streamline workflows and enhance efficiency while minimizing human error. In critical experiments, that adds up. Whether it’s sample sorting, precise pipetting, or sample preparation for analysis, Azenta has tools for every occasion. Moreover, Azenta’s robotic workstations cater to a wide spectrum of laboratory procedures. From DNA extraction to polymerase chain reaction, Azenta is making sure that their robots also serve their core business, which is also heavily DNA focused.Azenta’s Q3 2023 earnings report shows growing revenue, but also growing costs. Revenue increased year-on-year from $133 million to $166. But operating loss went from $5 million to $16 million over the same time period. Still, that has not deterred Azenta from continuing its share buyback program this year. They had repurchased $764 million by August 8th, and aim to purchase $1 billion by the end of 2023. While Azenta isn’t becoming more profitable yet, their growing revenue is cause for celebration if they can bring down costs alongside it.The bottom line is that Azenta is a powerful robo-lab stock catering to DNA applications. And since DNA is a necessary ingredient in every aspect of biotechnology, Azenta has great potential as the entire industry grows.Waters (WAT)quantification of the sample by gas mass chromatographySource: borzywoj / Shutterstock.comWaters (NYSE:WAT) is a leader among robo-lab company stocks. It has long been a major player in analytical chemistry and separation techniques. They have been pushing the boundaries of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) for decades. Now they’re adding more and more automation to the mix.HPLC-MS experiments can require long bouts of waiting around, watching a line getting drawn on a graph. When that line spikes in a certain direction up, you need to quickly move to catch the liquid coming out of the machine. This kind of grunt work has long been the domain of undergraduates and junior lab members. But it is being quickly automated by Waters’ technology. These latest Waters systems can perform every aspect of an HPLC-MS experiment. Injecting the sample, retrieving what comes out, and processing the data of the experiment, can now all be done without the help of a human.In addition to their HPLC-MS robots, Waters also has a robotic pipette on offer. Pipettes are the tools used to accurately add or remove very precise volumes of liquid. And the Waters system, called Andrew, allows a number of pipette-based assays to now be done entirely robotically. In all, Waters is quickly making it so that researchers no longer even have to be inside the lab to complete their experiments, as these systems can be controlled entirely remotely.Waters’ Q2 2023 earnings report shows revenue and costs mostly stable. Net sales increased slightly year-on-year from $1.40 to $1.43 billion, while net income decreased slightly from $325 to $291 million. But their products are making it possible to bring robotics to every experiment a life scientist can do. And that makes them one of the most exciting robo-lab stocks to buy.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

As you know, the Internet is full of data, but not much information, relatively speaking. That is, it doesn’t take much to disseminate pure baloney, which is why people do it.However, when it comes to stocks Ray Dalio likes, you can rest assured you’re putting your money into a legitimate avenue, not a clown show. According to Investopedia, Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which blossomed into the world’s largest hedge fund. Plus, the legendary investor has seen it all, adding credibility to top Dalio-approved stocks.And that point bears repeating (no pun intended). Too often, we see fly-by-night operations promising systems that yield gargantuan gains. But as the secular bull market fades, so too do those promised returns. With leading picks from Ray Dalio, you’re trading alongside the best of the best who has proven himself across decades. Honestly, the legendary investor doesn’t need my preamble. Below are Dalio’s investment choices to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMcDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockA favorite among consumers and investors, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is one of the top Ray Dalio stocks. According to data aggregator Finbox, Dalio’s hedge fund Bridgewater holds $423.4 million worth of MCD or 2.6% of its portfolio. Since the start of the year, shares have only moved up a bit more than 6%. However, the Golden Arches is built for those interested in the long game.For one thing, the fast-food icon occupies the lower rungs of the consumer discretionary space. Rather than eating at pricey sit-down restaurants or even trendy fast-casual eateries, people may elect the lowest-cost option available while still enjoying the not-cooking part. In that regard, McDonald’s fits the bill.Story continuesSecond, the company provides cheap caffeine on the go. Over time, as companies start getting aggressive about their return-to-office mandates, MCD could easily become one of the leading picks from Ray Dalio. Finally, analysts dig MCD, pegging it a strong buy. As well, their average price target lands at $331.27, implying nearly 18% upside potential.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the most frequently discussed Ray Dalio stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) specializes in minimally invasive surgery through the utilization of robotic medical systems. Per Finbox, Bridgewater holds $140.2 million worth of ISRG stock. This translates to 0.9% of its portfolio. Since the start of the year, shares returned nearly 18%. Over the past five years, ISRG gained over 74%.Fundamentally, there could be more upside, making ISRG an enticing name among stocks Ray Dalio likes. According to Allied Market Research, the underlying industry reached a valuation of $60.64 billion in 2020. However, by 2030, the segment could hit $94.42 billion. Given the myriad positives of minimally invasive procedures – such as fewer hospitalization stays – it’s possible the sector could be undervalued.Another factor that makes ISRG one of the top Dalio-approved stocks is support among Wall Street analysts. Currently, the market experts peg ISRG as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 12 buys and two holds. Lastly, the average price target hits $377.14, implying nearly 21% upside potential.Meta Platforms (META)Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comWith so much attention paid to companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and their role in advancing artificial intelligence, it’s easy to forget about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). That would be a mistake that Bridgewater refuses to make. Currently, the hedge fund holds $154.3 million worth of META, or 1% of its portfolio. Since the Jan. opener, META gained over 137%, making it one of the best-performing Ray Dalio stocks.Fundamentally, if you’re interested in AI stocks, Meta could be enticing. Featuring solid revenue growth and consistent profitability, the company formerly known as Facebook invests heavily in generative AI. Specifically, it’s developing Llama 2, Meta’s open-source large language model. As a major player in the generative AI space, you may want to target META rather than a heavily hyped entity that could end up correctly later.Based on analysts’ consensus, the social media and tech giant represents a top player among Dalio’s investment choices. With 41 buys and only two holds as the worst individual rating, the experts love META. Also, the price target clocks in at $376.19, implying over 27% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for KLA Is KLA Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.53bUS$3.12bUS$2.88bUS$3.71bUS$4.07bUS$4.33bUS$4.56bUS$4.75bUS$4.92bUS$5.08bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.49%Est @ 5.19%Est @ 4.28%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$3.2kUS$2.6kUS$2.2kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.2%) = US$77bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$77b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$58b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$498, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KLA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.344. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for KLAStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Semiconductor industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(NYSE:VZ) will increase its dividend on the 1st of November to $0.665, which is 1.9% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $0.653. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 7.8%. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Prior to this announcement, Verizon Communications was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 0.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 54%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendVerizon Communications Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.06 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.61. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.4% over that duration. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Verizon Communications has seen earnings per share falling at 7.9% per year over the last five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits.Our Thoughts On Verizon Communications' DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Verizon Communications' payments are rock solid. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Verizon Communications that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

That deprived nearly 15 million Spectrum cable subscribers of access to key sporting events, potentially including Saturday's U.S. Open match pitting 19-year-old American Coco Gauff against the world's highest ranked player, Aryna Sabalenka, in the women's final.If an agreement cannot be reached by Monday evening, Spectrum subscribers in New York and Los Angeles will be unable to watch the first Monday Night Football game of the season, pitting the Buffalo Bills against the New York Jets, now led by veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Disney announced this spring that Monday Night Football games would be carried on both ESPN and its ABC Network. That means Spectrum cable subscribers who live in markets with a local ABC TV affiliate not owned by Disney, including Buffalo, New York, will be able to watch Monday's NFL match-up broadcast. That's not the case for Spectrum video customers who live in New York City and Los Angeles, which are served by Disney-owned television stations.Self-proclaimed Bills fan Kris Shofner expressed her anger over the black-out on social media.""I have already missed a week of my @USOpen tennis and it looks like I will miss the finals!"" Shofner wrote on X, the platform previously known as Twitter. ""I waited all summer long for the US Open and I got screwed!""Such ""carriage disputes"" are commonplace in the media world, Charter argues this negotiation is different because the video ecosystem is broken. Some 25 million cable subscribers have cut the cord, industry-wide, over the last five years, as rising prices for content translate to higher fees for subscribers, contributing to the exodus.Story continuesCharter is seeking greater flexibility in its programming packages and the ability to offer Disney's ad-supported streaming services to its subscribers at no additional charge.Disney counts on fees that companies such as Charter pay to partly cover rising programming costs, including the rights to air sports such as the NFL and the NBA. It said in a statement on Thursday that it “stands ready” to resolve the carriage dispute, and “do what’s in the best interests” of Charter’s customers.Spectrum referred its subscribers to the sports streaming service Fubo, which carries ESPN's Monday Night Football games, and is offering cable customers a discount of 25% to 35% for the first two months, depending on the plan. Disney, for its part, announced a discount for its Hulu + Live TV service, which will provide access to the U.S. Open, college football and NFL games. The promotion offers the service for $50 a month for three months, a $20 monthly savings.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 70% ownership.  That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$33b last week after a 4.0% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 25% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Devon Energy's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Devon Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Devon Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Devon Energy. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.5% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Devon Energy Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$201m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.  General Public OwnershipWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Devon Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Devon Energy (at least 2 which shouldn't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Building wealth through investing is certainly possible, but only if the investor is patient, disciplined and committed to long-term thinking. The final ingredient is a stock that has the endurance to withstand market cycles and deliver steady returns over the long haul.With that in mind, here are the top three forever stocks you might want to consider adding to your “Patient Capital” watch list.Kraft HeinzThe Kraft Heinz corporation is only eight years old, but the two brands that constitute it have each been around for more than a century. Kraft Foods Inc. was founded in 1909 while the H. J. Heinz Co. was established in 1869. Both brands have steadily grown their footprints across the world over the intervening decades.In some parts of the world, these brands are synonymous with cheese, ketchup and macaroni. Brand recognition like this takes forever to build, which is why the combined business has so much underlying value.Today, the company (NASDAQ:KHC) is worth more than $41 billion, and the stock trades at about 17 times earnings — reasonable for a low-growth consumer brand.Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BKR.B), first acquired a stake in Heinz in 2013. Two years later, the firm put up $5 billion as part of the mega-merger that brought the two household brands together.

KO — the company’s ticker symbol — also offers a 3% dividend yield, which makes it an ideal target for income-seeking investors like Buffett.Buffett currently owns 400 million shares of KO worth $24 billion. It’s the fourth-largest position in his portfolio, which is a testament to his long-term commitment to this brand. Retail investors should certainly take a closer look at this blue chip.American ExpressAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is 173 years old, which makes it the oldest company on this list.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) shareholders have seen the share price rise 52% over three years, well in excess of the market return (27%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 0.8% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for American Express In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.American Express was able to grow its EPS at 27% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 15% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 3 years was 58%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican Express shareholders are up 0.8% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 9% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market.

Building wealth through investing is certainly possible, but only if the investor is patient, disciplined and committed to long-term thinking. The final ingredient is a stock that has the endurance to withstand market cycles and deliver steady returns over the long haul.With that in mind, here are the top three forever stocks you might want to consider adding to your “Patient Capital” watch list.Kraft HeinzThe Kraft Heinz corporation is only eight years old, but the two brands that constitute it have each been around for more than a century. Kraft Foods Inc. was founded in 1909 while the H. J. Heinz Co. was established in 1869. Both brands have steadily grown their footprints across the world over the intervening decades.In some parts of the world, these brands are synonymous with cheese, ketchup and macaroni. Brand recognition like this takes forever to build, which is why the combined business has so much underlying value.Today, the company (NASDAQ:KHC) is worth more than $41 billion, and the stock trades at about 17 times earnings — reasonable for a low-growth consumer brand.Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BKR.B), first acquired a stake in Heinz in 2013. Two years later, the firm put up $5 billion as part of the mega-merger that brought the two household brands together.

KO — the company’s ticker symbol — also offers a 3% dividend yield, which makes it an ideal target for income-seeking investors like Buffett.Buffett currently owns 400 million shares of KO worth $24 billion. It’s the fourth-largest position in his portfolio, which is a testament to his long-term commitment to this brand. Retail investors should certainly take a closer look at this blue chip.American ExpressAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is 173 years old, which makes it the oldest company on this list.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Cincinnati Financial's shares on or after the 15th of September, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 16th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cincinnati Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 2.9% on the current share price of $105. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Cincinnati Financial can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Cincinnati Financial paid out a comfortable 33% of its profit last year.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Cincinnati Financial, with earnings per share up 6.3% on average over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Cincinnati Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.3% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Cincinnati Financial? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Cincinnati Financial more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Cincinnati Financial for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cincinnati Financial that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for General Electric Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.26bUS$7.61bUS$8.66bUS$9.19bUS$9.61bUS$9.98bUS$10.3bUS$10.6bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.52%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$5.8kUS$6.6kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$63bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$214bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$214b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$104bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$167b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$112, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.067. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General ElectricStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Industrials market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For General Electric, we've put together three further aspects you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with General Electric (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for GE's future outlook?

(NYSE:FCX) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-freeport-mcmoran-140020844.html,1694268020,STORY,['FCX'],"[With its stock down 7.4% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Freeport-McMoRan's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Freeport-McMoRan is:13% = US$3.3b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Freeport-McMoRan's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Freeport-McMoRan's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Freeport-McMoRan's exceptional 21% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Freeport-McMoRan's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 32% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for FCX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Freeport-McMoRan Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Freeport-McMoRan's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 13%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 87% of its profits. So it looks like Freeport-McMoRan is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Freeport-McMoRan is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 21% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Freeport-McMoRan's future ROE will rise to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Freeport-McMoRan's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.
