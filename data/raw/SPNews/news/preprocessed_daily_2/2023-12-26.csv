These are the two words that threaten to undermine most if not all the holistic benefits associated with responsible and sustainable practices. We’re talking about concepts such as diversity, equity, inclusion and more diversity. All these attributes represent the strength of American progressive values until the stinky stuff called reality hits the fan.', 'Yes, folks, I’m talking about resource scarcity. As many political pundits have pointed out, many (if not most) conflicts in the modern era either center on oil access or are at least tangentially related to it. In the military flashpoints of tomorrow, nations may shed blood over dwindling fresh water sources.', 'Further, Harvard Business Review pointed out that the green economy comes under threat because of resource scarcity. How so? Basically, green technologies and infrastructure rely heavily on specific products or materials. As green initiatives expand in scope, these underlying resources could become scarce, perhaps causing supply chain bottlenecks.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'At worst, such scarcity might fuel conflicts, either cold ones or hot, thus undoing much social good. It’s an ugly situation that has no great answers. Well, other than maybe you want to check out these stocks to buy?', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is a lighting and building management company. It features operations throughout North America, along with Europe and Asia. Per its public profile, Acuity represents the largest lighting manufacturer in North America based on market capitalization. Since the start of the year, AYI gained over 20% of its equity value.', 'Relevance: Don’t worry – you didn’t slip into a wormhole. We’re very much talking about stocks to buy for resource scarcity. While Acuity doesn’t directly deal with the underlying topic, it does specialize in energy-efficient lighting and building automation systems. As critical resources become scarcer, various governmental initiatives should focus on resource efficiency. AYI could easily help in this matter.', 'Pros: It appears that Wall Street got the memo, which has seen AYI gain almost 12% in the trailing month. Further, the company has a solid track record in beating per-share profitability expectations.', 'Cons: Analysts are pensive on AYI, rating shares as a consensus hold.', 'Source: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in San Jose, California, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) is a multinational computational software company.

Similar to other high-flying tech entities, CDNS soared over 71% on a year-to-date basis.', 'Relevance: Again, Cadence might not seem a particularly relevant idea for stocks to buy on resource scarcity. However, the company offers several intriguing initiatives worth consideration. For one thing, management disclosed that it achieved 100% renewable energy for its global operations. Second, Cadence’s innovations have been integrated into multiple clean-energy directives, including in electric vehicle design.', 'Pros: As a tech specialist in the ever-burgeoning semiconductor sphere, Cadence offers a credible platform for long-term growth. Further, the company benefits from solid revenue growth and consistent profitability over the past decade.', 'Cons: Although analysts peg CDNS as a consensus moderate buy, the average price target of $270.40 implies sideways consolidation.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Hailing from Brazil, Vale (NYSE:VALE) is a multinational corporation engaged in metals and mining. It’s also one of the largest logistics operators in its home nation. Further, according to its public profile, Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world. It’s a bit volatile, with shares down 7% on a year-to-date basis.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, the underlying iron ore commodity isn’t particularly a flashpoint for resource scarcity. So, why mention VALE as one of the stocks to buy for this topic? Iron ore demand continues to rise globally. In fact, Straits Research notes that the sector could expand to $350.8 billion by 2031, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.74% from 2022. With high-quality iron ore deposits concentrated in specific regions, the matter could spark global competition.', 'Pros: Overall, Vale enjoys strong revenue growth and relatively consistent profitability. Also, it’s undervalued at a forward earnings multiple of only 6.68x.', 'Cons: Political stability concerns along with infrastructural challenges may impact VALE.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Realty Income is a retail REIT, because it owns properties that it leases to retailers, and it's one of the best retail REITs on the market."", ""One feature that makes Realty Income stand out is that it pays dividends monthly, which is especially appealing for people counting on passive income, like retirees. Realty Income has paid 640 monthly dividends (that's more than 53 years!) and has increased the dividend for 104 consecutive quarters. That's a hard track record to beat."", ""In its goal of becoming a top global REIT, Realty Income has expanded its portfolio by purchasing quality properties and acquiring other REITs.

That's especially true for stocks that have yet to ride the wave of the current market rally, which includes several high-quality dividend stocks. Realty Income (NYSE: O), Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE: MAA), and Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI) have lost ground over the past year because of the impact of higher interest rates on the real estate sector. That headwind should fade over the coming year, setting these real estate investment trusts (REITs) up to potentially go on their own bull run in 2024 and beyond."", ""Shares of Realty Income have slumped about 10% in 2023. That has pushed the REIT's dividend yield up to 5.4%. Higher interest rates have been the main factor weighing on the company's share price. It has caused concerns that Realty Income might struggle to grow as its cost of capital rises. "", ""However, the company has taken steps to sidestep those concerns. It agreed to buy fellow REIT Spirit Realty in a $9.3 billion deal, which includes assuming Spirit's low-cost debt. It used its stock to buy an even more beaten-down REIT. The deal should thus boost the combined company's adjusted funds from operations (FFO) by more than 2.5% next year. In addition, the larger-scale REIT will produce over $800 million in post-dividend free cash flow next year, giving it significant no-cost capital to make additional accretive investments. The Spirit Realty acquisition and those future deals should enable Realty Income to achieve its long-term growth target (4% to 5% annually) without issuing any equity. "", ""Meanwhile, the main headwind weighing on its stock over the past year (rising interest rates) should fade in 2024, given the Federal Reserve's forecast of three rate cuts in the coming year. That should lift the weight off its stock, potentially setting the stage for Realty Income to produce a strong total return from here."", 'Shares of apartment REIT MAA have slumped about 15% this year. That sell-off has pushed its dividend yield up to 4.4%.', 'Despite what its slumping stock price might suggest, MAA is having a solid year.

', ""While rent growth has been decent (4.5% in the third quarter), it's slower than in recent years because of increased apartment supply in its markets. However, that headwind has started to fade as its markets have absorbed the new supply. That drives the REIT's view that it should start seeing higher rent growth in late 2024. Meanwhile, the company should continue benefiting from its development and redevelopment investments. It has a couple of communities in the lease-up phase and three more that it should complete next year. The company is also renovating lots of older units, which are capturing much higher lease rates upon renovation. These catalysts position the company to continue growing its FFO at a decent clip. That's allowing it to steadily raise its dividend (it recently boosted the payout by 5%, its 14th straight year of dividend growth). "", 'Shares of communications infrastructure REIT Crown Castle have also lost about 15% this year. That has driven its dividend yield up to 5.4%.', 'The tower owner is battling a few headwinds, including higher interest rates, lower capital spending by mobile carriers, and the merger of two key customers. These issues have slowed it down. Crown Castle expects its adjusted FFO to grow by only 2% this year, while it anticipates an 8% decline in 2024. The company has had to press pause on increasing its dividend through at least 2025 while it waits for growth to reaccelerate.

It recently unveiled plans to conduct a comprehensive review of its fiber business following pressure from an activist investor. Analysts believe the business could be worth $11 billion to $15 billion in a potential sale. A sale could unlock the value of those assets while giving Crown Castle the cash to repay debt and fund higher-returning tower and small cell investments. That could boost its stock price. ', 'While the S&P 500 appears to be on the cusp of beginning a new bull market, not all stocks have participated in the rally.

Investors have long bought gold to offer a measure of protection from the risks of inflation and market volatility.', 'Learn: How To Invest In GoldMore: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple Hack', 'With inflation still well above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, many experts predict a big year for gold in 2024. Gold is in hot demand as an investment, a status symbol and a key component in many electronic products.', '“When inflation rates rise, gold prices often increase as well,” Gold IRA Guide analyst Liam Hunt tells MarketWatch. “If current trends of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures continue, there could be upward pressure on gold prices.”', 'Almost everyone is hedging that gold will rise next year, with some analysts predicting values to reach a bullish $2,300 per ounce (it’s selling at around $2,035 today), says CBS News. But what about gold makes it such a long-term, safe investment? Here’s five reasons gold is a good bet during economic turmoil.', 'Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. During periods of rising prices, the value of fiat currencies (those not backed by a commodity, like gold or silver) may decline. Still, gold tends to maintain its value or even appreciate.', '“Gold is the best hedge there is and every portfolio,” says Collin Plume, founder of Noble Gold Investments. “We have an average of an economic downturn every 5.5 years. Each time a downturn happens, you need that one asset that will keep you buoyant while you wait for the rest of your portfolio to recover.”', 'The value of gold has been on an upward trajectory over the last century. As the United States Gold Bureau notes, in contrast to the declining value of the U.S. dollar over time, gold’s value has “exploded.” Throughout history, gold has retained its purchasing power, making it a reliable asset during economic uncertainties.', 'Think of gold as the outsider in your portfolio. The whole point of diversification is to include assets from different classes that aren’t correlated to help reduce overall risk. The relation between gold and stocks is essentially zero.', 'Recognized and accepted globally, and not tied to any specific country, gold is a universal store of value that can be easily traded or converted into other assets. NPR calls gold an “old-school investment.” But global demand for the precious metal increased 20% last year and its value sits at a decade high.', 'With the supply of gold being relatively limited and new discoveries becoming rarer, this scarcity can contribute to maintaining its value over time. In 2020, the BBC reported that we might have already reached peak gold — “the point when gold production is no longer growing, and the mining industry cannot meet rising demand,” per Forbes.

Shares of this company have already surged by nearly 40% in 2023. However, there are still many factors that can propel the stock higher in the coming months.', 'First, Snowflake is benefiting from new enterprises migrating data and workloads from their on-premises legacy systems to its cloud-native data platform. The company is also seeing expansion of workloads by existing customers, indicating that they are expanding usage over time.', 'Second, these demand trends are helping the company add new high-value clients to its customer base. In the third quarter, Snowflake added 35 new customers who will each contribute over $1 million in annual revenue. That brings the total number of $1 million-plus customers to 436, up 52% year over year.', ""Third, Snowflake's ability to handle unstructured data has been a major differentiator for the company. Over 30% of its customers utilized the data platform to process unstructured data. That's led to a 17-fold year-over-year rise in the consumption of unstructured data in October 2023.

(NYSE:MSI) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period."", 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' View our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions ', ""The Chairman & CEO, Gregory Brown, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$16m worth of shares at a price of US$292 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$310). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 12% of Gregory Brown's stake."", ""Insiders in Motorola Solutions didn't buy any shares in the last year.

In total, insiders sold US$1.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all."", ""Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Motorola Solutions insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$154m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""Insiders haven't bought Motorola Solutions stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Motorola Solutions makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

Wall Street has noticed, too: Microsoft’s stock is up 55% this year.', 'That’s why CNN Business’ staff chose Nadella as the CEO of the Year, beating out other contenders including Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.', '“There’s no question 2023 was the year of AI,” Nadella told CNN in an emailed response. “We’re no longer just talking about innovation in the abstract; we’re seeing real product-making, deployment and productivity gains. At the end of the day, though, this innovation will only be useful if it’s empowering all of us in our careers, in our communities, in our countries.”', 'Since 2018, the CNN Business’ team of writers and editors have met at the end of each year to select one person whose executive performance stood out. The process is admittedly subjective — we choose someone based on criteria that shifts year to year.', 'Maybe the company’s stock outperformed its rivals. Maybe the CEO righted the ship after a messy product launch or the company developed a lifesaving vaccine that altered the course of human history (tip of that hat to 2021’s CEO of the Year, Pfizer’s Albert Bourla).', 'This year’s CEO of the Year is once again a man, indicative of a larger representative problem in corporate America’s top positions. About 10% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, according to Fortune. But our aim has never been to endorse any one executive over another. Rather, we hold a mirror up to the business world and tell a story about what we see. (We also considered non-CEO leaders, and chose Taylor Swift as our business leader of the year.)', 'For 2023, Nadella’s decisions have heavily impacted and influenced the direction of AI, the most significant innovation to come from Silicon Valley in decades.', 'As Gil Luria, a senior research analyst at wealth management firm DA Davidson, puts it: “His ability to steer the aircraft carrier that is Microsoft into this new era has been nothing short of remarkable.”', 'Nadella’s background doesn’t entirely fit the Ivy League dropout archetype of Silicon Valley. Born in India, Nadella came to the US in the late 1980s to pursue a master’s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, later receiving an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.', 'Nadella’s standout performance is a culmination of his work from prior years. He joined the company in 1992 as an engineer, at a time Microsoft was characterized by regulators as a monopoly.', 'When he was promoted to CEO nearly 10 years ago, Microsoft had developed a reputation for being slow to adapt to major trends, such as mobile. Fast forward to now and tech companies are lining up to partner with Microsoft and align with its mission to commercialize artificial intelligence for the masses.', 'In Nadella’s 2017 book, “Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone,” he wrote about his experience reworking everything internally, team by team and product by product, so Microsoft would be better set up for employees to collaborate with others.', 'He also worked to soften and revitalize Microsoft’s image. As far back as 2016, the company partnered with OpenAI — a then-emerging company with new AI tools — and allowed them to operate the technology on its Azure cloud servers in exchange for access to those tools.', 'But after a massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI earlier this year, following the viral launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft rolled out AI-powered versions of its flagship products, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, breathing new life into otherwise dulled software. Nadella’s push to commercialize these tools quickly gave it a head start against competitors such as Google and Amazon, who were working on similar technologies, and helped ignite an arms race across the industry.', 'Now as more companies, from Instacart to Snapchat, add ChatGPT and other OpenAI technologies to their own services, Microsoft’s cloud business is poised for deeper growth. Microsoft has reported strong Azure growth over the last three quarters.', 'While Nadella had an impressive year across the board, his leadership shined even brighter during the string of events that followed the surprising ousting of OpenAI’s Altman, the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week.', 'The timing was noteworthy too: Just four days before, Nadella joined Altman on stage at OpenAI’s first developer conference to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and their partnership together.', 'The executives represented one of the most dynamic and key relationships in the tech industry, not only of the year but in years: Altman had clearly emerged as the face of the generative AI movement, and Nadella was one of the most powerful tech leaders funding the development of these tools.', '“You guys have built something magical,” said Nadella at the time. “It’s been fantastic for us.”', 'But despite his long-standing relationship with OpenAI, Nadella reportedly found out about Altman’s removal from the company “just before” OpenAI released a statement, rendering Microsoft with no control over the situation.', 'The company in a statement said an internal investigation found that Altman was not always truthful with the board.', 'Microsoft’s stock sank in response, perhaps because OpenAI was to serve as a linchpin to their plans to expand AI across its products.\xa0“It was not a good look for Microsoft,” Luria said.', 'Nadella swiftly picked up the phone and offered to hire Altman at Microsoft to lead a new AI research lab, along with one of the co-founders, Greg Brockman, and any of the 700 Open AI employees who wanted to leave the company.', 'He also spoke to some OpenAI board members — the people who initially kept him out of the loop — and was able to get them on board with a solution that would be favorable to Microsoft, according to Luria.', 'Altman ultimately returned to OpenAI, with a new board intact.', '“He turned what looked like a bad and embarrassing situation into a way to improve Microsoft’s standing with this very important partner,” Luria added. “What we saw from Mr. Nadella is an interpersonal skill you don’t always find with CEOs, who can be visionaries and luminaries and great at product, but aren’t necessarily able to pick up a phone, talk to people and get them to see things your way.”', 'As Fred Havemeyer, a senior enterprise software analyst at the Macquarie financial services firm, said in a letter to investors, “Mr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI — its ambitious talent.”', 'By Monday morning, Microsoft was in better shape than they were a week before. Its stock reached a record that day; shares rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44, beating the previous record of $376.17.', 'According to Stuart Carlaw, chief research officer at ABI Research, Nadella’s successful year can be largely attributed to the fact that he’s remained extremely “focused.”', '“His approach to the mechanics of leadership remains people driven,” Carlaw said. “He understands that people drive outcomes, and remained true to that ethic in the way he dealt with Sam Altman and the wider OpenAI team.”', 'Nadella also narrows in on where he wants to spend his energy. “He hasn’t been on a scattergun spree of investment ever since he took the reins,” Carlaw said. “He has been very focused on accretive areas that take the Microsoft brand forward.”', 'Takeshi Numoto, Microsoft’s chief marketing officer who has been employed in various roles at the company for 25 years, said he felt an internal culture shift this year, saying the company feels “fresh” and “energizing.”', '“There is a sense that we are contributing to building the next wave of computing broadly for the world, and doing so thoughtfully,” he said.', 'Nadella told CNN he indeed remains “focused” on empowering both people and organizations to achieve more, as it continues to make and deploy new products.', '“That’s our mission at Microsoft … and what we continue to focus on as we look to 2024 and beyond,” he said. “Just imagine if 8 billion people had access to a personalized tutor, a doctor that provided them medical guidance, a mentor that gave advice for anything they needed. I believe all that’s within reach. It’s about making the impossible possible.”', 'The biggest challenge, however, is if Nadella can take Microsoft to the next level by making these AI-powered products profitable.', '“You are only as good as your last results release,” Carlaw said. “[But] he is not the only one facing this dilemma.”', '—CNN’s Allison Morrow contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Perhaps Munger's biggest legacy? Spurring Buffett to switch from investing in very cheap stocks to investing in high-quality businesses at reasonable prices."", ""That's because whatever a stock may do in the near term or whatever its current valuation multiple, Munger taught us that over a long time period, stocks tend to return close to the return on capital of the underlying business."", 'In a 1995 speech, Munger said:', ""Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6% return -- even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result."", ""That's why for investors truly looking at the long term, a focus on quality, competitive advantage, and a high return on invested capital (ROIC) is crucial to success. And it's also why the following three tech stocks should be targets for your new investment dollars today, even after impressive year-to-date runs."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may be the second largest stock in the world, but that doesn't mean Microsoft can't continue rewarding shareholders. After all, Microsoft was the largest company in the world in the year 2000. Despite massive gains since then, it's only the second-largest today. So... lots of room to grow."", 'Over the past 25 years, Microsoft has always had a very high return on capital by virtue of its dominant position in Windows operating systems, the Office enterprise software suite, and the Dynamics enterprise resource planning system. But over the past decade, the company has had a renaissance under CEO Satya Nadella, who took over as CEO almost exactly 10 years ago.', 'Under Nadella, Microsoft has muscled its way into a strong No. 2 position in the all-important cloud computing infrastructure market, with some analysts saying it could become the No. 1 cloud infrastructure-as-a-service vendor by the end of this decade.', ""That would probably come about through Microsoft's savvy investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. That foresight has catapulted Microsoft to the lead in the artificial-intelligence race. And despite some recent turmoil at OpenAI, it's still regarded as the AI leader. Given that we're still in the early innings of the AI races, there should be a lot of growth ahead for both OpenAI and Microsoft together."", ""While AI and cloud get the lion's share of attention, investors also shouldn't overlook Microsoft's other acquisitions during Nadella's tenure, such as the 2016 purchase of LinkedIn, or this year's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The fact that Microsoft was still able to acquire such a large company despite its already massive size speaks volumes about Microsoft's still-hungry attitude despite its historical success."", ""The best part? Every one of Microsoft's businesses is insanely profitable. In fact, Microsoft's overall operating margin stands at a ridiculously high 47.6% over the past 12 months, with a return on equity of 39.1%. And keep in mind, this is during a somewhat soft year for enterprise software spending."", ""No wonder Microsoft has a higher credit rating than even the U.S. government. While that doesn't mean Microsoft stock is totally risk-free, it's probably the closest thing to it in the stock market today."", ""Unlike Microsoft, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is not reliably profitable. In fact, over the past 12 months, the company has generated an operating loss of $6.2 billion. That's because the memory industry is in a severe bust following the pandemic -- its worst since the Great Financial Crisis."", 'So why is Micron a tech stock to buy and hold for the long term? It comes down to scarcity. Since the memory industry is so challenging, with severe boom-and-bust cycles, the global memory industry has consolidated to just three large DRAM companies and six large NAND flash companies.', ""Micron plays in both types of memory, but it has nearly three-quarters of its revenue coming from DRAM. And while DRAM is the most consolidated of the two types of memory, it's also the one that's likely to benefit the most from artificial intelligence."", ""That's because AI training systems need massive amounts of volatile data to process in order to train algorithms. That requires a very premium and high-intensity type of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory. Micron will be ramping up its cutting-edge HM3E generation in early 2024, which management boasts will have 10% better performance and 30% lower power consumption compared with the best solutions on the market today."", 'Meanwhile, the industry appears to be turning up. All three major DRAM players have cut back on their spending and reallocated equipment toward leading technology nodes. That supply cut, along with AI-driven demand, is allowing prices to rise again.', 'Micron reported fiscal first quarter earnings last week, with revenue up 18% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of expectations. While that was impressive, Micron guided for another 12% quarter-over-quarter growth in the current quarter, with profitability inflecting upward.', 'So while Micron is inking losses today, it appears the industrywide supply cutbacks and AI-fueled demand are sowing the seed of the next ""boom."" Keep in mind, during the 2018 memory boom, Micron\'s ROIC reached as high as 40%.', 'Given we are at the early stages of the next upturn and the industry is unlikely to see a demand blowup like the post-pandemic downturn, competitively advantaged Micron is another stock to which one can allocate long-term dollars today.', 'Of the three mentioned stocks here, ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) has the highest efficiency, with a stunning 76.3% return on equity over the past 12 months.', 'One can think of ASML as a key ""pick and shovel"" player in the AI gold rush. In fact, all leading-edge semiconductors manufactured on nodes 7nm and lower need ASML\'s extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. What\'s so attractive about ASML is that it has a monopoly on EUV, as the technology is insanely difficult to pull off.

But over time, quality dividend stocks rarely lose their luster -- especially when a company has what it takes to grow earnings and the dividend over time. Earnings growth, paired with dividend growth, can boost the investment thesis, which can open the door to capital gains on top of dividend income.', ""Here's why Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Leggett & Platt (NYSE: LEG), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) are three dividend stocks worth buying now."", 'Lee Samaha (Whirlpool): The home appliance maker has had a difficult year. Rising interest rates have hit the housing market and consumer spending in general. In addition, ongoing cost pressures have eroded profit margin performance. As such, its earnings per share are set to decline by nearly 20% to $15.71, according to Wall Street estimates.', 'The bad news is out of the way; it\'s time to focus on the stock\'s value proposition. In response to weakening market conditions, management is cutting costs and is on track to deliver $800 million in cost cuts in 2023. Management believes there will be some ""carryover"" in the cost-cutting into 2024.', ""In addition, Whirlpool is set to sell its European domestic appliance business next year, removing itself from a market it's struggled in."", ""While all these operational improvements are taking place, the U.S. housing market looks likely to improve year over year in 2024, not least with the prospect of lower interest rates. Whirlpool's management is targeting $500 million in free cash flow\xa0in 2023, and that will easily cover its $385 million dividend payout. Throw in some margin recovery in 2024 due to costs, exiting unfavorable markets, and the possibility of lower raw material costs, and Whirlpool's dividend looks sustainable."", ""Scott Levine (Leggett & Platt): It's not often that investors can find companies on firm financial footing that offer ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are on sale. But that's exactly the opportunity that Leggett & Platt stock, along with its forward yield of 6.8%, offers income investors right now. Those looking to prosper from a passive income powerhouse in 2024 -- and for many years beyond -- would be wise to add Leggett & Platt to their must-buy list."", ""In addition to its impressive 140-year history, Leggett & Platt, a manufacturer of bedding components and automotive seating, distinguishes itself as a Dividend King, having hiked its dividend for 52 consecutive years. Achieving this rank is no easy feat, and it suggests that the company's dedication to rewarding shareholders is embedded in its ethos -- a valued quality for investors who intend to buy and hold for the long term."", ""Understandably, circumspect investors may balk at the stock's ultra-high yield, fearing that the payout isn't sustainable. But this concern is quickly allayed when checking in with the company's payout ratio. Over the past 10 years, Leggett & Platt has averaged a conservative 68% payout ratio. Additionally, the company's strong free cash flow often exceeds that which the company returns to shareholders in dividends."", 'With shares of Leggett & Platt currently valued at 6.1 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 11.3, now seems like a great time for investors to procure some prodigious passive income with Leggett & Platt stock.', ""Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): When considering no-brainer dividend stocks for next year, you want to choose a company that blends a track record of dividend raises, upside potential, value, and growth. It's hard to find all those attributes from a single company -- let alone two or three. But Starbucks has them all."", 'Over the last month, Starbucks stock is down 7.5% compared to a 5.6% gain in the S&P 500.', ""At first, Starbucks enjoyed a nice spike from blowout results, including record-high quarterly revenue. However, sentiment shifted, and Starbucks stock began stagnating or going down despite the market's best period of the year."", ""So why the underperformance? The short-term reason is that Starbucks is facing some internal struggles -- namely, ongoing labor-related differences with its employees. Starbucks released a memo to its partners, customers, and stakeholders on Dec. 11 that expressed some of these concerns. Starbucks is trying to improve its relationship with its employees through opportunities and higher pay. Some may doubt Starbucks' ability to raise wages and sustain its growth without impacting its margins. But Starbucks depends heavily on its workers, and its future depends on the efficiency of its stores."", ""After all, Starbucks' master plan is to grow its rewards membership, boost mobile ordering, increase ticket volumes, and process more orders -- all of which rely heavily on its employees being able to make more drinks (and process more complicated orders) faster. So, paying its employees more should be the right long-term move."", ""As for stock's valuation, Starbucks trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.3, which isn't cheap, but it's a reasonable price for a high-quality business like Starbucks -- especially if it sustains its growth in the years to come."", 'Starbucks is also an underrated dividend stock, having raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years. The raises are sizable, too, and they have helped the company grow into an ultra-reliable dividend stock that currently sports a 2.3% yield.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Whirlpool wasn't one of them.

Authenticity has become a central moral framework in society–the subtle yet pervasive value that animates and adjudicates our media, culture, and politics. Merriam-Webster recently announced that “authentic” was its 2023 word of the year, thanks to a surge in online search queries.', 'Consumers have long sought authenticity, as it gets stamped on a range of goods and experiences made attractive largely because they appear to lack marketplace motives. The mom-and-pop diner; the vinyl record shop–the local and uncommercialized. Think dive bars, farmers markets, and indie cinemas.', 'Studies find that consumers rate independent, family-run outposts more authentic than chains–and even shrug off hygiene code violations if a hole-in-the-wall seems sufficiently off the beaten path. Authenticity also beckons tourists, pointing toward paths less traveled such as Cuba, Bhutan, or Burning Man.', 'Scholarly articles about authenticity more than doubled in the 2010s and leading pollster John Zogby found that it topped the list of Americans’ cultural yearnings.', '“You have aspirational positioning from every brand out there to want to make their offering feel bespoke and handcrafted and unique,” one marketing COO quips. “The fact of the matter is that there’s tens of thousands of others of that [product] pumping out every single week.”', 'That quest for authenticity is, in short, a quest for uniqueness amidst homogenous mass production. Today’s consumers seek what one philosopher-critic called “aura”–a singular product relative to the readily replicable. Social theorist Andreas Reckwitz diagnoses consumers as in thrall to “singularities”–distinctive objects, spaces, and experiences that fulfill cultural desires rather than functional needs that assembly lines once simply satisfied.', 'Franchising, in particular, embodies McWorld alienation as corporations implement formulaic operations that erode local character: nondescript office parks, suburban tract homes, and casual dining chains. Most can’t preserve nuance at the massive scale that profit demands.', 'The more sameness is offered, the more consumers go searching for something real to grab onto and discover themselves within. Call this the identity politics of the shopping cart.', 'As a concept, authenticity hatched in response to 18th- and 19th-century industrialization. Humanity’s relationship with machines became disenchanted, not just at work–where efficiency, automation, and quantity dominated values–but also with this logic spilling into consumer experiences.', 'Although authenticity cannot be found in Victorian-era vocabulary about merchandise, by 1908 Coca-Cola was already pitching itself as “genuine”–part of manufacturers’ efforts to persuade that their brand was more natural and traditional than fellow factory-line products filling home shelves. This rhetoric intensified in recent years.', 'Take Starbucks, which has long tried to reproduce the “aura” of that cute, little indie coffee shop in your neighborhood–some 55,000 times over. Its brand guidebook reportedly mandates five ideals that had to apply to every design choice: handcrafted; artistic; sophisticated; human; and enduring. These seek to convince you that this Starbucks is truly unique and special, unlike the (same) one a block away.', 'Hence, the interiors’ aesthetic accentuation–earth hues, wicker baskets, curvy motifs, stained woods, unfinished metals–all to contrast the prepackaged synthetics that envelop fast food. Hence, too, the customer’s name read aloud rather than an automated receipt number–simulating rituals of familiarity and tradition.', 'Starbucks doesn’t become globally ubiquitous if it can’t fake authenticity in this fashion, even if being globally ubiquitous inherently invalidates that.', 'The authenticity ideal is artisanal craft, romantically conjuring premodern labor untainted by massive machinery. Goods that are “handmade” in “small-batch” as opposed to cash-grab; shelves that are curated, not commercialized.', ""Origin stories also authenticate, seeking to make a company genealogically trustworthy by emphasizing a point or person of provenance. Think Ben & Jerry's here, or the naïve moral authenticity of any amateur startup tinkering in a garage for love rather than money."", 'Research suggests that a company’s founding intent matters a great deal to consumers: If seen as “self-transcendent” (i.e., for society or community) rather than for “self-enhancement” (wealth or status), the brand scans authentic. Greed, for lack of a better word, isn’t good at conveying that.', 'Authenticity also explains a recent swing toward vintage aesthetics–campaigns, slogans, and logos from yesteryear dusted off and trotted out, from Pizza Hut’s red roof icon to Miller Lite’s throwback font: “Brands want to say, ‘We’re still that same company with humble roots,’” one brand strategist explained. “So [they] reverse-engineer that value to an audience that may not be privy to a backstory.”', 'This, then, is the ultimate contrivance: For a century, \xa0corporations have tried to sell us they have a “soul.” As one advertising creative director rhapsodizes, “Brands have to have a voice; they have to have character; they have to have morals.”', 'To that end, Dunkin’ Donuts shortened the name on its (11,000-plus) outlets to just “Dunkin’” to “highlight how the brand was now on a first-name basis with fans,” even giving away “handmade friendship bracelets” to commemorate the copyright registry.', 'To be sure, there is something understandable, yet lamentable, in that notion. You can’t be friends with an LLC, yet anthropomorphism remains the central delusion of branding. Authenticity is, after all, a nostalgic reflex. We yearn for it most in times of rapid change. Much as industrialization generated a longing for agrarian simplicity a century ago, today’s high-tech landscape–one of AI chatbots and digital deepfakes–generates much the same wistfulness for a world being lost.', 'Michael Serazio is an associate professor of communication at Boston College and the author of, most recently, The Authenticity Industries: Keeping it ‘Real’ in Media, Culture & Politics.', 'Economic pessimists’ bet on a 2023 recession failed. Why are they\xa0doubling down in 2024?', 'COVID-19 v.

Essentially, we’re talking about comfortable wagers on profitable, well-established enterprises. They’re not going to make you rich but they probably won’t put you on the streets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With that, below are intriguing dividend stocks for passive income to consider.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: A multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) deserves consideration as one of the dividend stocks to buy for its critical business model. Per its public profile, Archer Daniels operates hundreds of plants and crop procurement facilities worldwide. While ADM is an integral component of the global food supply chain, various geopolitical and economic headwinds have pushed shares down sharply this year.', 'Relevance: As a food-processing firm, the relevance of ADM is obvious. Humans need to eat and bad things happen when we don’t. In terms of hard data, the global food processing market reached a valuation of $169.39 billion last year. Further, experts project that the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% by 2031. At the forecast culmination point, the industry could clock in at slightly over $301 billion.', 'Pros: Right now, analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $92.13 price target, implying over 27% upside. Also, the company provides a forward dividend yield of 2.49%, backed by 50 years of consecutive payout increases.', 'Cons: As stated earlier, ADM is volatile so investors should be prepared for downside risk.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that truly needs no introduction, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a stalwart in the soft drinks space. While the company suffered a sizable hit during the Covid-19 crisis, since 2020, Coca-Cola has steadily expanded the top line. Further, it has been consistently profitable, making KO a solid idea for dividend stocks for passive income.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, Coca-Cola should benefit from the trade-down effect if economic conditions remain challenged. Rather than opt for expensive caffeinated beverages at trendy coffeeshops, more consumers will be trading down to the local grocery store for their quick pick-me-ups. That should help lift KO as Coca-Cola products compete favorably in terms of brand awareness and price point.', 'Pros: At the moment, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 3.12%, beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the company enjoys 61 years of consecutive payout increases, a status management won’t want to give up on. Thus, it’s one of the top dividend stocks to buy.', 'Cons: Priced at a forward earnings multiple of 21x, investors will be paying a premium for KO.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Another well-known enterprise, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies. Per its public profile, Exxon Mobil is the largest direct descendent of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Maybe you should keep that factoid in mind the next time you’re on a quiz show. Since the start of the year, XOM dipped about 5%.', 'Relevance: Although XOM is down below parity as we approach the end of 2023, it offers a compelling argument for top dividend stocks to buy. Yes, I understand the whole argument about society’s pivot toward clean and renewable energy sources. However, you can’t beat the science. Specifically, fossil fuels remain relevant because of their incredible energy density.', 'Pros: Currently, Exxon Mobil carries a forward yield of 3.74%. Admittedly, that’s a bit lower than the sector average 4.24%. However, Exxon commands 41 years of consecutive dividend increase. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at just under 40%.', 'Cons: Geopolitical factors combined with reduced demand has led to volatility in recent months.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

37,c63a630c-09d6-30dd-824f-7a27c645eb13,PM,2023-12-26,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy if the Fed Cuts Rates,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-140032677.html,1702994432,STORY,"['KHC', 'IBM', 'HIMX', 'VZ', 'PSA']","['With speculation about interest rate cuts seemingly reaching a fever pitch, it’s naturally time to consider high-yield dividend stocks. To be sure, this segment has lost some of its attractiveness over roughly the past two years as the Federal Reserve began earnestly hiking borrowing costs. But with that narrative possibly shifting, it may be time to pivot our portfolio as well.', 'While it’s not a perfect correlation – nothing ever is in the equities sector – higher borrowing costs tend to cloud passive-income providers, especially high-yield dividend stocks. Basically, when investors seek higher dividend rewards, they usually must absorb higher risks. However, if the yield on U.S. government bonds start rising, a competition effect occurs.', 'Basically, the government competes with the capital market and let’s face it: for stability, you can’t beat Uncle Sam. But if this narrative will fade due to interest rate cuts, then high-yield dividend stocks should regain relevance.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Of course, we just don’t know what will actually materialize. However, if you’re convinced about dovishness next year, these might be the high-yield dividend stocks that will benefit the most.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'What it is: A juggernaut in the technology and innovation fields, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is no stranger to most investors. However, over the past several years, the enterprise known as “Big Blue” faded against younger competitors. Still, that circumstance appears to be shifting as IBM witnessed a (relatively) impressive rise this year, gaining almost 18% in the trailing half-year period.', 'Relevance: While the company may have been overshadowed, it still levers considerable acumen in the fields of AI and machine learning. As well, it researches and develops applications leveraging blockchain technology. That could be a surprisingly niche growth sector. Per MarketsandMarkets, the segment reached a valuation of $7.4 billion in 2022. By end of 2027, it could generate revenue over $94 billion.', 'Pros: Right now, IBM offers a forward dividend yield of 4.09%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company commands 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, something that management won’t want to give up.', 'Cons: While an attractive example of high-yield dividend stocks, IBM has a history of disappointing investors.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An international self-storage company, the easy-to-recognize brand Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Per its public profile, the company is the largest brand of self-storage services in the U.S. While the share price has been choppy this year, PSA managed to gain about 6% since the January opener. It currently carries a market capitalization of $51 billion.', 'Relevance: With the unique dynamics tied to the Covid-19 crisis, self-storage units may see increased demand in the years ahead as they facilitate downsizing. Essentially, customers can live in smaller residences while storing their bulky possessions in the underlying facilities. According to Mordor Intelligence, the sector should see slow and steady expansion (a compound annual growth rate of 4.37%) from 2022 to 2028.', 'Pros: Public Storage offers a forward yield of 4.14%. Now, the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 107.97%, though it’s important to remember it’s a REIT. Financially, Public Storage benefits from strong revenue growth and consistent profitability.', 'Cons: Analysts don’t seem particularly enthused about PSA, seeing a slight decrease in the share price.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Leveraging a recognizable brand in the broader food and beverage ecosystem, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America, per its public profile. It’s also the fifth largest in the world, thus benefiting from a massive footprint. In terms of perceived safety ahead of interest rate cuts, KHC makes a strong case for high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, KHC ranks highly in part because it’s one of legendary investor Warren Buffet’s favorites. In November, I stated that shares were undervalued. At the time, KHC traded hands at a forward earnings multiple of 11.34X. Recently, that stat has increased some to 12.33x. The good news? Relative to the median sector value of 15.2x, Kraft Heinz is, at least on paper, a discounted opportunity among high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Pros: Presently, Kraft Heinz carries a forward dividend yield of 4.37%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 52.8%. The Oracle is doing Oracle things.', 'Cons: If you’re looking for a yield-and-capital-gains combo, don’t. Analysts only see 2% upside.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A “sinful” example of high-yield dividend stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) understandably carries a controversial profile. As a tobacco giant, there’s no amount of bovine scatology that it can distribute to ameliorate criticism. Hey, if you want brainwashing, you have to go to the best: the Kremlin’s disinformation unit. However, it’s surprisingly relevant.', 'Relevance: Relevant, really? Haven’t global smoking prevalence declined significantly over the past several years? You’re absolutely correct but as Tobacco Atlas points out, in many countries, prevalence did not change. Worse yet from an anti-tobacco advocacy standpoint, prevalence increased. Another factor that benefits PM as one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy is the vaping industry. That has skyrocketed in popularity.', 'Pros: Currently, Philip Morris carries a forward yield of 5.5%, well above the consumer staples sector as mentioned above. Also, the company features 16 years of consecutive dividend increases, a stat management will want to keep increasing.', 'Cons: PM hasn’t gone anywhere since 2021 and that was when interest rate cuts were the norm.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational telecommunications conglomerate, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a huge player in the 5G rollout. Thanks to its ownership and operation of an extensive network infrastructure – including a robust wireless network that covers a large portion of the U.S. – Verizon is critical for business in the modern age. It also features a massive market cap of over $157 billion.', 'Relevance: As stated above, Verizon represents a critical cog in the broader telecom ecosystem. Further, many of its individual units enjoy a burgeoning total addressable market. For example, the 5G services sector may hit a valuation of $121.8 billion by the end of this year. By 2028, this segment could soar to over $1 trillion. That comes out to a stunning CAGR of 52.4%, per MarketsandMarkets.', 'Pros: At the moment, Verizon offers a forward yield of 7.12%, making it one of the enticing high-yield dividend stocks. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable given the generous yield at 57.38%.', 'Cons: Again, if you’re looking for a yield-and-gains combo, don’t. Analysts on average see upside potential of only 5.5%.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Canada, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) specializes in the midstream component of the hydrocarbon energy value chain. This segment involves storage and transportation, thus representing the link between the upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing) components. Given its vast network of pipelines that cover thousands of miles across Canada and several U.S. states, it’s an integral part of the North American economy.', 'Relevance: While there’s much talk about electric vehicles and alternative energy sources, the world continues to run on oil. Without getting into conspiratorial realms, the reality is that much (if not most) of the conflicts in the modern age have at least tangentially been related to oil. Cynically, this harsh framework implies that oil will be with us for longer than expected.', 'Pros: Companies like Enbridge form part of the backbone of the economy. Thus, it makes a credible case for high-yield dividend stocks. To be sure, Enbridge commands a forward yield of 7.5%. Still, watch out for that ultra-high payout ratio of 130.52%.', 'Cons: Analysts aren’t particularly convinced with ENB, pegging it a consensus hold.', 'Source: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Headquartered in Tainan City, Taiwan, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading supplier and fabless manufacturer. While it might not be a household name on this side of the Pacific, Himax manufactures display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers. These products are vital for television sets, laptops, monitors and mobile phones.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where people no longer watch TV nor use laptops nor mobile phones, Himax is relevant. More than likely, it’s permanently so. If you want to put some numbers to it, Statista points out that the IC market in total will generate revenue of $443.3 billion by the end of this year. Further, the sector will continue to expand at a CAGR of 7.87% to 2027.', 'Pros: Himax offers a forward yield of 7.89%, which is massive. It’s also undervalued, carrying a forward earnings multiple of only 9.77x.', 'Cons: HIMX suffers from recent disappointing performances. That might change if interest rate cuts become a reality but it’s still a speculative proposition.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But over time, quality dividend stocks rarely lose their luster -- especially when a company has what it takes to grow earnings and the dividend over time. Earnings growth, paired with dividend growth, can boost the investment thesis, which can open the door to capital gains on top of dividend income.', ""Here's why Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Leggett & Platt (NYSE: LEG), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) are three dividend stocks worth buying now."", 'Lee Samaha (Whirlpool): The home appliance maker has had a difficult year. Rising interest rates have hit the housing market and consumer spending in general. In addition, ongoing cost pressures have eroded profit margin performance. As such, its earnings per share are set to decline by nearly 20% to $15.71, according to Wall Street estimates.', 'The bad news is out of the way; it\'s time to focus on the stock\'s value proposition. In response to weakening market conditions, management is cutting costs and is on track to deliver $800 million in cost cuts in 2023. Management believes there will be some ""carryover"" in the cost-cutting into 2024.', ""In addition, Whirlpool is set to sell its European domestic appliance business next year, removing itself from a market it's struggled in."", ""While all these operational improvements are taking place, the U.S. housing market looks likely to improve year over year in 2024, not least with the prospect of lower interest rates. Whirlpool's management is targeting $500 million in free cash flow\xa0in 2023, and that will easily cover its $385 million dividend payout. Throw in some margin recovery in 2024 due to costs, exiting unfavorable markets, and the possibility of lower raw material costs, and Whirlpool's dividend looks sustainable."", ""Scott Levine (Leggett & Platt): It's not often that investors can find companies on firm financial footing that offer ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are on sale. But that's exactly the opportunity that Leggett & Platt stock, along with its forward yield of 6.8%, offers income investors right now. Those looking to prosper from a passive income powerhouse in 2024 -- and for many years beyond -- would be wise to add Leggett & Platt to their must-buy list."", ""In addition to its impressive 140-year history, Leggett & Platt, a manufacturer of bedding components and automotive seating, distinguishes itself as a Dividend King, having hiked its dividend for 52 consecutive years. Achieving this rank is no easy feat, and it suggests that the company's dedication to rewarding shareholders is embedded in its ethos -- a valued quality for investors who intend to buy and hold for the long term."", ""Understandably, circumspect investors may balk at the stock's ultra-high yield, fearing that the payout isn't sustainable. But this concern is quickly allayed when checking in with the company's payout ratio. Over the past 10 years, Leggett & Platt has averaged a conservative 68% payout ratio. Additionally, the company's strong free cash flow often exceeds that which the company returns to shareholders in dividends."", 'With shares of Leggett & Platt currently valued at 6.1 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 11.3, now seems like a great time for investors to procure some prodigious passive income with Leggett & Platt stock.', ""Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): When considering no-brainer dividend stocks for next year, you want to choose a company that blends a track record of dividend raises, upside potential, value, and growth. It's hard to find all those attributes from a single company -- let alone two or three. But Starbucks has them all."", 'Over the last month, Starbucks stock is down 7.5% compared to a 5.6% gain in the S&P 500.', ""At first, Starbucks enjoyed a nice spike from blowout results, including record-high quarterly revenue. However, sentiment shifted, and Starbucks stock began stagnating or going down despite the market's best period of the year."", ""So why the underperformance? The short-term reason is that Starbucks is facing some internal struggles -- namely, ongoing labor-related differences with its employees. Starbucks released a memo to its partners, customers, and stakeholders on Dec. 11 that expressed some of these concerns. Starbucks is trying to improve its relationship with its employees through opportunities and higher pay. Some may doubt Starbucks' ability to raise wages and sustain its growth without impacting its margins. But Starbucks depends heavily on its workers, and its future depends on the efficiency of its stores."", ""After all, Starbucks' master plan is to grow its rewards membership, boost mobile ordering, increase ticket volumes, and process more orders -- all of which rely heavily on its employees being able to make more drinks (and process more complicated orders) faster. So, paying its employees more should be the right long-term move."", ""As for stock's valuation, Starbucks trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.3, which isn't cheap, but it's a reasonable price for a high-quality business like Starbucks -- especially if it sustains its growth in the years to come."", 'Starbucks is also an underrated dividend stock, having raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years. The raises are sizable, too, and they have helped the company grow into an ultra-reliable dividend stock that currently sports a 2.3% yield.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Whirlpool wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Value investing is the surest way of beating the markets on a consistent basis. Of course, being under the radar might imply that investors need to buy and patiently wait for the rally. However, when the upside comes, it compensates for the time and price corrections.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Therefore, let’s discuss three breakout stocks likely to surprise in the next 12 to 24 months.', 'Source: shutterstock.com', 'Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stock has been subdued with a correction of 6% in the last 12 months. APTV looks attractive at a forward P/E ratio of 18.6.', 'Aptiv PLC is an automotive technology company that claims to be the leader in vehicle architecture. For Q3 of 2023, APTV reported revenue of $5.1 billion, which was higher by 7% on a year-on-year (YOY) basis. For the same period, the company reported operating cash flow of $746 million. Hence, this implies an annualized OCF potential of $3 billion.', 'Indeed, the operating and free cash flows may swell in the coming years. For 2024, Aptiv PLC has already guided for significant margin expansion that’s “driven by alignment to safe, green and connected megatrends.” This is a key catalyst for APTV stock upside.', 'And, for the last financial year, the company reported order booking of $32 billion. For the first nine months of 2023, order booking stands at $27 billion. Also, an increase in order intake indicates potential growth acceleration.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/zedspider', 'Amcor PLC (NYSE:AMCR) is trading at a valuation gap. Besides the forward price-earnings ratio of 14, AMCR stock offers a dividend yield of 5.2%. After a correction of 18% for year to date (YTD), I expect this undervalued stock to trend higher and deliver healthy total returns.', 'Amcor PLC sells packaging products in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. For Q1 of 2024, the company reported a 6% decline in sales to $3.4 billion. However, it has already guided for return to growth in the year’s second half.', 'Additionally, AMCR is focusing on higher value product categories, which will also boost margins. Further, the company expects presence in 25 emerging markets to drive growth. Impressively, Amcor PLC invests $100 million annually in research and development. Introduction of innovative packaging products (sustainable packaging) is likely to be another growth catalyst. With these long-term tailwinds, it’s easy to be bullish on AMCR stock at current valuations.', 'Source: Nesterenko Maxym / Shutterstock.com', 'Lastly, Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is largely unnoticed but it could be a multibagger in the making.', 'The first reason to be bullish is that the company is in the defense sector. Specifically, Leonardo DRS has a differentiated product offering, providing defense electronic products and systems. Therefore, positive industry tailwinds will sustain through the decade.', 'Notably, DRS reported an order backlog off $4.7 billion for Q3 of 2023, with a swelling backlog of 50% YOY.

41,5c6761ae-79f3-3206-a882-b42862ff203d,PEG,2023-12-26,7 ‘Bulletproof’ Stocks to Buy Ahead of a Wild New Year,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bulletproof-stocks-buy-ahead-235424998.html,1703030064,STORY,"['ABBV', 'V', 'KR', 'MSFT', 'PEG']","['Although a new year tends to bring optimism in the market, current vagaries warrant a discussion about bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. To be fair, even the most influential voices in government are hinting at a positive outcome. Nevertheless, nothing is guaranteed.', 'For example, Wall Street has responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s apparent willingness to shift monetary policy. After roughly two years of aggressive interest rate hikes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees the possibility of lowering borrowing costs next year. On paper, that doesn’t sound like the most ideal time to consider stable stocks. Rather, investors may want to consider higher-risk growth opportunities.', 'Still, let’s consider the context. With the U.S. jobs market continuing to print robust numbers, the idea of rate cuts seems premature. After all, that would imply expanding the inflation problem, not addressing it. As well, a global recession – which is a non-zero probability – would hurt risk-on assets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With so many questions, investors should at least consider these bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR', 'What it is: Presenting about as self-explanatory of a company name as you can get, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) easily qualifies as one of the bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. After all, the underlying business is a dirty job but someone has to do it. It’s not particularly sexy but WM doesn’t leave investors stranded for too long. Since the January opener, shares gained over 13%.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where humans don’t produce trash, WM should belong on your list of stable stocks. Again, it’s not a sexy growth opportunity. But what WM does is to provide confidence heading into an uncertain future. In particular, the company benefits from slow-and-steady revenue growth. Also, its gross margin comes in at around 37% to 38%, in line with historical norms.', 'Pros: Analysts appreciate the reliability of WM, rating it a moderate buy with a $182.44 price target. It also offers a modest dividend yield of 1.6%.', 'Cons: Basically, WM is the investment market’s equivalent of a prevent defense. You buy it to secure the win, not necessarily to score a 70-yard bomb.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. Its biggest subsidiary is the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, a regulated gas and electric utility firm. Fundamentally, PEG should benefit from the natural monopoly effect. Essentially, utilities are too deeply entrenched in their chosen markets to be displaced.', 'Relevance: If you’re looking for bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024, it’s difficult to overlook the utility space. According to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, experts project that next year, electricity prices will remain steady. Further, sales should rise about 2%. We’re not talking about groundbreaking stuff here. Instead, it’s all about the consistent and predictable demand profile.', 'Pros: For bargain-hunting investors, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.98X. That’s conspicuously lower than the sector median of 14.44x. Also, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $64.90 price target.', 'Cons: The long-term chart performance of PEG has been slow indeed so it’s good if you’re literally seeking stable stocks.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A financial services giant, Visa (NYSE:V) of course is known universally as a payment card provider. Per its public profile, the company facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. While the sector presents risks, V has performed well, basically matching the performance of the S&P 500 this year.', 'Relevance: If borrowing costs decline as the Fed seems to be hoping for, then Visa could rise on boosted consumer sentiment. Under any inflationary cycle (“regular” inflation up to hyperinflation), money today is worth more than money tomorrow. So, an incentive exists to spend that money today. However, if we fall into rough waters, cynically, consumers will turn to credit cards to make ends meet. That’s already happening, actually.', 'Pros: Visa enjoys steady revenue growth and is consistently profitable thanks to its robust margins. Analysts also rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $281.74 price target.', 'Cons: With U.S. credit card debt collectively topping $1 trillion, a fundamental question exists about the viability of Visa as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that truly needs no introduction, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the fast-food industry. Indeed, I would argue that it’s a cultural icon representing American-style capitalism at its finest. After all, the brand’s debut in the Soviet Union likely helped thaw the Cold War. Now, the company is seeking to reboot itself with its CosMc’s spinoff.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, I believe McDonald’s makes a great case as one of the stable stocks that could rise amid the challenges. With CosMc’s, the Golden Arches is putting Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) right in its crosshairs. By offering the customization options that consumers of Generation Z crave at a lower price point, MCD almost seems a no-brainer. I don’t want to get ahead of myself but the new initiative is exciting.', 'Pros: Ironically, MCD isn’t much of a discount in terms of valuation. However, the company enjoys solid revenue growth and consistent profitability via excellent margins. And who knows? MCD could be undervalued based on the future potential of CosMc’s. Thus, it’s one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Cons: Despite the excitement over the spinoff, it will be tough to displace Starbucks.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An American pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a range of compelling therapeutics. Per its public profile, the company’s primary product is Humira, which is approved to treat various autoimmune diseases. Further, thanks to its purchase of Allergan, AbbVie now controls Botox, which should be a big winner over the long run. Thus, it’s one of the stable stocks to consider.', 'Relevance: Generally speaking, blue-chip pharmaceuticals offer a level of economic insulation. Cynically, when people suffer from critical conditions, they often do whatever it takes to get better. For ABBV specifically, the global botulinum toxin – which is what Botox is – will reach a valuation of $11.1 billion at year’s end. Further, the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, boding well for AbbVie.', 'Pros: Thanks to its robust profitability metrics, AbbVie offers a solid dividend yield of 3.84%. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $172.50 price target.', 'Cons: Admittedly, ABBV hasn’t had the best performance this year as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Another company that needs no introduction, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a computer software and hardware giant. While the company over the years has seen its dominance challenged from enterprises like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the reality is that Microsoft owns the professional office application ecosystem. After all, when was the last time you forwarded a Numbers spreadsheet rather than an Excel file?', 'Relevance: Again, while Microsoft has seen challenges to its digital hegemony, it still dominates in key areas. For example, in terms of desktop operating systems, Microsoft Windows commands a nearly 69% market share. In other words, the brand is practically ingrained in the broader digital space. Also, with Microsoft Office, the company enjoys consistent and predictable revenue growth.', 'Pros: While not the most exciting idea among bulletproof stocks, Microsoft brings to the table strong revenue growth and consistent profitability. As well, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $422.70 average price target.', 'Cons: MSFT already enjoyed a strong year in 2023 thanks to its initiatives in artificial intelligence. Therefore, it’s questionable how much it can rise in 2024.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A supermarket and multi-department store operator, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a stalwart in the grocery store industry. Fundamentally, KR attracts investors because of its everyday demand. Unless humans find a way to survive and thrive without convenient access to food and water, Kroger should rank among the stable stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Relevance: While I don’t expect meme traders to clamor over Kroger, the company should benefit no matter what happens with the economy. Let’s say we enter a decisive bull market. Fine, people will still need to eat. If instead, we fall into a recession, Kroger should benefit from the trade-down effect. That is, households will likely eschew eating out at restaurants and cook at home, saving money.', 'Pros: One of the main factors favoring KR as one of the bulletproof stocks is the valuation. Trading at 10.14x forward earnings, it’s well below the sector median of 15.4x. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $51.36 price target.', 'Cons: Since June of last year, KR hasn’t moved much so expectations need to be kept in check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The relation between gold and stocks is essentially zero.', 'Recognized and accepted globally, and not tied to any specific country, gold is a universal store of value that can be easily traded or converted into other assets. NPR calls gold an “old-school investment.” But global demand for the precious metal increased 20% last year and its value sits at a decade high.', 'With the supply of gold being relatively limited and new discoveries becoming rarer, this scarcity can contribute to maintaining its value over time.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study NOV's  ROE in this article."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' View our latest analysis for NOV ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NOV is:', '8.8% = US$489m ÷ US$5.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""On the face of it, NOV's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that NOV grew its net income at a significant rate of 48% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently."", ""As a next step, we compared NOV's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 23%."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""NOV's ' LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio is on the lower side at 16% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (84%) of its profits. So it looks like NOV is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", ""Moreover, NOV is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 10.0% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 11%, over the same period."", ""On the whole, we do feel that NOV has some positive attributes.

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital."", ' See our latest analysis for Zoetis ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:', '45% = US$2.3b ÷ US$5.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.45 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Zoetis has a superior ROE than the average (11%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.', ""That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", 'Zoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality.

If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Looking back further, the stock price is 41% higher than it was three years ago."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' See our latest analysis for NRG Energy ', ""Because NRG Energy made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size."", 'NRG Energy actually shrunk its revenue over the last year, with a reduction of 2.8%. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned a solid 55% the last twelve months. We can correlate the share price rise with revenue or profit growth, but it seems the market had previously expected weaker results, and sentiment around the stock is improving.', 'The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested.

As it happens, NRG Energy's TSR for the last 1 year was 62%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""It's good to see that NRG Energy has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 62% in the last twelve months.

Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

The Spirit Realty acquisition and those future deals should enable Realty Income to achieve its long-term growth target (4% to 5% annually) without issuing any equity. "", ""Meanwhile, the main headwind weighing on its stock over the past year (rising interest rates) should fade in 2024, given the Federal Reserve's forecast of three rate cuts in the coming year. That should lift the weight off its stock, potentially setting the stage for Realty Income to produce a strong total return from here."", 'Shares of apartment REIT MAA have slumped about 15% this year. That sell-off has pushed its dividend yield up to 4.4%.', 'Despite what its slumping stock price might suggest, MAA is having a solid year. Its core FFO rose by nearly 11% per share through the third quarter. The REIT has benefited from solid rent growth, strong occupancy levels, and investments to enhance its portfolio. ', ""While rent growth has been decent (4.5% in the third quarter), it's slower than in recent years because of increased apartment supply in its markets. However, that headwind has started to fade as its markets have absorbed the new supply. That drives the REIT's view that it should start seeing higher rent growth in late 2024. Meanwhile, the company should continue benefiting from its development and redevelopment investments. It has a couple of communities in the lease-up phase and three more that it should complete next year. The company is also renovating lots of older units, which are capturing much higher lease rates upon renovation. These catalysts position the company to continue growing its FFO at a decent clip. That's allowing it to steadily raise its dividend (it recently boosted the payout by 5%, its 14th straight year of dividend growth). "", 'Shares of communications infrastructure REIT Crown Castle have also lost about 15% this year. That has driven its dividend yield up to 5.4%.', 'The tower owner is battling a few headwinds, including higher interest rates, lower capital spending by mobile carriers, and the merger of two key customers. These issues have slowed it down. Crown Castle expects its adjusted FFO to grow by only 2% this year, while it anticipates an 8% decline in 2024. The company has had to press pause on increasing its dividend through at least 2025 while it waits for growth to reaccelerate. ', 'However, the company has a notable potential upside catalyst that could drive shares higher in 2024. It recently unveiled plans to conduct a comprehensive review of its fiber business following pressure from an activist investor. Analysts believe the business could be worth $11 billion to $15 billion in a potential sale. A sale could unlock the value of those assets while giving Crown Castle the cash to repay debt and fund higher-returning tower and small cell investments. That could boost its stock price. ', 'While the S&P 500 appears to be on the cusp of beginning a new bull market, not all stocks have participated in the rally. Many REITs have remained under pressure because of higher interest rates and other headwinds. However, those headwinds could fade next year, setting Realty Income, MAA, and Crown Castle up to potentially go on their own bull runs in 2024 and beyond.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

To be fair, even the most influential voices in government are hinting at a positive outcome. Nevertheless, nothing is guaranteed.', 'For example, Wall Street has responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s apparent willingness to shift monetary policy. After roughly two years of aggressive interest rate hikes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees the possibility of lowering borrowing costs next year. On paper, that doesn’t sound like the most ideal time to consider stable stocks. Rather, investors may want to consider higher-risk growth opportunities.', 'Still, let’s consider the context. With the U.S. jobs market continuing to print robust numbers, the idea of rate cuts seems premature. After all, that would imply expanding the inflation problem, not addressing it. As well, a global recession – which is a non-zero probability – would hurt risk-on assets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With so many questions, investors should at least consider these bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR', 'What it is: Presenting about as self-explanatory of a company name as you can get, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) easily qualifies as one of the bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. After all, the underlying business is a dirty job but someone has to do it. It’s not particularly sexy but WM doesn’t leave investors stranded for too long. Since the January opener, shares gained over 13%.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where humans don’t produce trash, WM should belong on your list of stable stocks. Again, it’s not a sexy growth opportunity. But what WM does is to provide confidence heading into an uncertain future. In particular, the company benefits from slow-and-steady revenue growth. Also, its gross margin comes in at around 37% to 38%, in line with historical norms.', 'Pros: Analysts appreciate the reliability of WM, rating it a moderate buy with a $182.44 price target. It also offers a modest dividend yield of 1.6%.', 'Cons: Basically, WM is the investment market’s equivalent of a prevent defense. You buy it to secure the win, not necessarily to score a 70-yard bomb.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. Its biggest subsidiary is the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, a regulated gas and electric utility firm. Fundamentally, PEG should benefit from the natural monopoly effect. Essentially, utilities are too deeply entrenched in their chosen markets to be displaced.', 'Relevance: If you’re looking for bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024, it’s difficult to overlook the utility space. According to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, experts project that next year, electricity prices will remain steady. Further, sales should rise about 2%. We’re not talking about groundbreaking stuff here. Instead, it’s all about the consistent and predictable demand profile.', 'Pros: For bargain-hunting investors, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.98X. That’s conspicuously lower than the sector median of 14.44x. Also, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $64.90 price target.', 'Cons: The long-term chart performance of PEG has been slow indeed so it’s good if you’re literally seeking stable stocks.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A financial services giant, Visa (NYSE:V) of course is known universally as a payment card provider. Per its public profile, the company facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. While the sector presents risks, V has performed well, basically matching the performance of the S&P 500 this year.', 'Relevance: If borrowing costs decline as the Fed seems to be hoping for, then Visa could rise on boosted consumer sentiment. Under any inflationary cycle (“regular” inflation up to hyperinflation), money today is worth more than money tomorrow. So, an incentive exists to spend that money today. However, if we fall into rough waters, cynically, consumers will turn to credit cards to make ends meet. That’s already happening, actually.', 'Pros: Visa enjoys steady revenue growth and is consistently profitable thanks to its robust margins. Analysts also rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $281.74 price target.', 'Cons: With U.S. credit card debt collectively topping $1 trillion, a fundamental question exists about the viability of Visa as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that truly needs no introduction, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the fast-food industry. Indeed, I would argue that it’s a cultural icon representing American-style capitalism at its finest. After all, the brand’s debut in the Soviet Union likely helped thaw the Cold War. Now, the company is seeking to reboot itself with its CosMc’s spinoff.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, I believe McDonald’s makes a great case as one of the stable stocks that could rise amid the challenges. With CosMc’s, the Golden Arches is putting Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) right in its crosshairs. By offering the customization options that consumers of Generation Z crave at a lower price point, MCD almost seems a no-brainer. I don’t want to get ahead of myself but the new initiative is exciting.', 'Pros: Ironically, MCD isn’t much of a discount in terms of valuation. However, the company enjoys solid revenue growth and consistent profitability via excellent margins. And who knows? MCD could be undervalued based on the future potential of CosMc’s. Thus, it’s one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Cons: Despite the excitement over the spinoff, it will be tough to displace Starbucks.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An American pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a range of compelling therapeutics. Per its public profile, the company’s primary product is Humira, which is approved to treat various autoimmune diseases. Further, thanks to its purchase of Allergan, AbbVie now controls Botox, which should be a big winner over the long run. Thus, it’s one of the stable stocks to consider.', 'Relevance: Generally speaking, blue-chip pharmaceuticals offer a level of economic insulation. Cynically, when people suffer from critical conditions, they often do whatever it takes to get better. For ABBV specifically, the global botulinum toxin – which is what Botox is – will reach a valuation of $11.1 billion at year’s end. Further, the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, boding well for AbbVie.', 'Pros: Thanks to its robust profitability metrics, AbbVie offers a solid dividend yield of 3.84%. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $172.50 price target.', 'Cons: Admittedly, ABBV hasn’t had the best performance this year as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Another company that needs no introduction, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a computer software and hardware giant. While the company over the years has seen its dominance challenged from enterprises like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the reality is that Microsoft owns the professional office application ecosystem. After all, when was the last time you forwarded a Numbers spreadsheet rather than an Excel file?', 'Relevance: Again, while Microsoft has seen challenges to its digital hegemony, it still dominates in key areas. For example, in terms of desktop operating systems, Microsoft Windows commands a nearly 69% market share. In other words, the brand is practically ingrained in the broader digital space. Also, with Microsoft Office, the company enjoys consistent and predictable revenue growth.', 'Pros: While not the most exciting idea among bulletproof stocks, Microsoft brings to the table strong revenue growth and consistent profitability. As well, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $422.70 average price target.', 'Cons: MSFT already enjoyed a strong year in 2023 thanks to its initiatives in artificial intelligence. Therefore, it’s questionable how much it can rise in 2024.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A supermarket and multi-department store operator, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a stalwart in the grocery store industry. Fundamentally, KR attracts investors because of its everyday demand. Unless humans find a way to survive and thrive without convenient access to food and water, Kroger should rank among the stable stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Relevance: While I don’t expect meme traders to clamor over Kroger, the company should benefit no matter what happens with the economy. Let’s say we enter a decisive bull market. Fine, people will still need to eat. If instead, we fall into a recession, Kroger should benefit from the trade-down effect. That is, households will likely eschew eating out at restaurants and cook at home, saving money.', 'Pros: One of the main factors favoring KR as one of the bulletproof stocks is the valuation. Trading at 10.14x forward earnings, it’s well below the sector median of 15.4x. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $51.36 price target.', 'Cons: Since June of last year, KR hasn’t moved much so expectations need to be kept in check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Gold is in hot demand as an investment, a status symbol and a key component in many electronic products.', '“When inflation rates rise, gold prices often increase as well,” Gold IRA Guide analyst Liam Hunt tells MarketWatch. “If current trends of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures continue, there could be upward pressure on gold prices.”', 'Almost everyone is hedging that gold will rise next year, with some analysts predicting values to reach a bullish $2,300 per ounce (it’s selling at around $2,035 today), says CBS News.

During periods of rising prices, the value of fiat currencies (those not backed by a commodity, like gold or silver) may decline.

Each time a downturn happens, you need that one asset that will keep you buoyant while you wait for the rest of your portfolio to recover.”', 'The value of gold has been on an upward trajectory over the last century. As the United States Gold Bureau notes, in contrast to the declining value of the U.S. dollar over time, gold’s value has “exploded.” Throughout history, gold has retained its purchasing power, making it a reliable asset during economic uncertainties.', 'Think of gold as the outsider in your portfolio. The whole point of diversification is to include assets from different classes that aren’t correlated to help reduce overall risk. The relation between gold and stocks is essentially zero.', 'Recognized and accepted globally, and not tied to any specific country, gold is a universal store of value that can be easily traded or converted into other assets. NPR calls gold an “old-school investment.” But global demand for the precious metal increased 20% last year and its value sits at a decade high.', 'With the supply of gold being relatively limited and new discoveries becoming rarer, this scarcity can contribute to maintaining its value over time. In 2020, the BBC reported that we might have already reached peak gold — “the point when gold production is no longer growing, and the mining industry cannot meet rising demand,” per Forbes.

These two are leading the charge in different areas and represent logical companies to invest in if trying to take advantage of the AI race.', ""But of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out."", ""First, let's discuss how these two tackle different areas of AI."", ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used in AI supercomputers because they have created an optimized system for processing data. The demand explosion caused by the generative AI development race created unprecedented demand for its GPUs, causing Nvidia's stock to rise an incredible 234% in 2023."", ""Alphabet's AI investment case is a bit wider. Its generative AI model, Gemini AI, beats most competitors (including OpenAI's GPT-4) in head-to-head competitions. It also has a cloud computing division, which allows clients to rent out computing power and data storage for many uses, including AI. Lastly, the company recently announced a reorganization in its advertising division to focus on further integrating AI."", ""Overall, Nvidia is a one-trick pony, but its one trick has been incredible. Alphabet is a much wider AI investment, making it a more conservative investment. There's no winner here, as the two represent different ways to invest in AI."", 'Call it a tie.', ""As mentioned above, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been unbelievable. In the 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29), its revenue rose 206% year over year to $18.1 million. It also guided for $20 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, so this wasn't just a single quarter of strength."", ""Alphabet's revenue growth was respectable at 11%, but it's not even in the same world as Nvidia."", 'Winner: Nvidia.', ""One part of the Nvidia investment thesis that's often overlooked is how sustainable these revenue levels are. It isn't a subscription company (for the most part); once it sells its GPUs, its client likely won't need to build another system for a while. This could create a problem in the future, as demand for GPUs might (or might not) disappear."", ""Should Nvidia's revenue fall off a cliff, the stock will follow suit, as it's priced like its growth is permanent (even though it's cyclical)."", ""Alphabet's products are mostly subscription-based or must be purchased regularly (like ads). This makes Alphabet's gains much more permanent than Nviida's."", 'Winner: Alphabet.', ""Valuing Nvidia on a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) basis can only be done with a caveat. It hasn't lapped its substantial growth yet, so it still has a few quarters that didn't produce the same earnings as its most recent ones."", ""But if Nvidia's sales decline after the sales boom cools, it would give investors an idea of how expensive the stock would be valued."", ""Using either metric, Nvidia is quite expensive. On the other hand, Alphabet's stock is much cheaper."", 'So, on this basis, Alphabet looks like a much better buy.', 'Winner: Alphabet.', ""The demand for Nvidia's GPUs right now is insatiable, but how long that demand lasts is unknown. It could be two quarters, two years, or two decades. As a result, the company's upside is unknown."", ""Alphabet likely won't grow much faster than 15% each year, but it should post revenue growth nearly every quarter."", 'So, depending on your risk tolerance, Nvidia could be a better buy if you want absolute upside, while Alphabet is better for consistent, long-term growth.', 'This one is another tie.', ""Choosing a winner here is really a matter of preference. The two stocks represent different investment philosophies. I'm more partial to Alphabet, as I would rather have a slower, more guaranteed upside than Nvidia's boom or bust."", ""I'm still concerned with what will happen with Nvidia's stock when the AI supercomputer demand is satisfied, and that is enough to keep me from investing in it (which could be a huge mistake on my part)."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average recently reached a new all-time high. Meanwhile, the broad-based S&P 500 and growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite are higher by 24% and 43% year to date, respectively, as of the closing bell on Dec. 22."", ""Although bull markets are collectively viewed with wide-eyed optimism by investors, it's important to recognize that not every stock will be taken along for the ride. As we prepare to push forward into a new year, five widely owned and exceptionally popular stocks stand out for all the wrong reasons. Despite their phenomenally strong performances in 2023, they're all stocks I'd sell right now."", ""The first stock I'd suggest cutting ties with is semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Though the company has been the top-performing megacap stock in 2023, its road to a repeat in 2024 is filled with a number of headwinds."", ""Nvidia's gains this year were driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are currently staples in high-compute data centers. Since production capacity for GPUs is limited, Nvidia has been able to command exceptional pricing power. Higher pricing on scarce A100 and H100 chips have driven almost the entirety of the company's data center segment sales growth."", ""However, things will be changing in the new year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has increased its chip on wafer on substrate capacity, which will allow Nvidia to sell more of its AI-driven GPUs. Additionally, Advanced Micro Devices will be increasing the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is a direct competitor to Nvidia. Less scarcity for GPUs in AI-accelerated data centers should quickly deflate Nvidia's pricing power (and its gross margin)."", ""U.S. regulators are also placing a ceiling on Nvidia's growth potential. Regulators have, on two occasions, placed limitations on high-powered GPU exports to China. These limitations could result in billions of dollars of lost revenue per quarter."", ""Furthermore, every next-big-thing investment trend over the past three decades has gone through an initial bubble phase, and I highly doubt AI is going to be the exception. As businesses take a step back and analyze their needs, it wouldn't be surprising if demand for Nvidia's GPUs failed to meet lofty expectations."", 'A second ultra-popular stock I believe is worth selling right now is warehouse club Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST).', ""Considering that Costco stock has produced only three years of negative total returns over the past 22 years, the thought of selling shares probably sounds preposterous. Costco's membership model tends to generate plenty of additional revenue each year that the company is able to use to undercut competitors on price and keep paying members loyal to its ecosystem of products and services. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the company's operating model."", ""Nevertheless, there are two reasons I'd shy away from this superstar stock in the new year."", ""First, there's the genuine possibility the U.S. could dip into a recession in 2024. A couple of money-based metrics with phenomenal track records suggest a downturn is likely."", 'Even though Costco provides basic-need goods that are going to draw members into its stores in any economic climate, discretionary spending typically declines during economic slowdowns and contractions. Costco relies on discretionary purchases to boost its razor-thin margins.', ""That leads to the more important second headwind: Costco's valuation. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 3, 2023), the company's sales grew by 5.2%, excluding changes in gasoline prices and foreign currency. Investors are paying 39x forward-year earnings for sales growth that only marginally exceeded the prevailing rate of inflation. This is the priciest Costco stock has been in a long time, which makes it an easy one to avoid in 2024."", ""The third ultra-popular stock to give the heave-ho to for the new year is none other than the world's largest automaker by market cap, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Though Tesla has a lengthy history of proving naysayers wrong -- it's working on its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit -- it's becoming increasingly harder to overlook the company's glaring flaws."", ""The first sign of trouble is Tesla's pricing strategy. During Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in May, CEO Elon Musk noted in response to a question from an investor that his company's pricing strategy is dictated by demand."", ""While there had been some hope that Tesla's wide-ranging price cuts across Models 3, S, X, and Y were due to production efficiencies, the truth appears to be that weaker demand, growing competition, and rising inventory levels are pushing Tesla to get more aggressive with its pricing. Over the trailing year ended Sept. 30, the company's operating margin has been more than halved to 7.6% from 17.2%."", 'Tesla has also struggled to differentiate itself from being ""just a car company."" Despite netting a gross profit from its energy generation, storage, and services segments, these are generally low-margin operating divisions. Tesla\'s profitability is reliant on the company selling and leasing EVs. At the moment, inventory levels are rising, and a significant portion of the company\'s pre-tax income is dependent on potentially unsustainable sources.', ""The final straw is Tesla's CEO. Elon Musk has found himself in the spotlight of securities regulators on a couple of occasions. What's more, he has an awful habit of overpromising and underdelivering when it comes to new innovations and EVs. It's not an enticing combination of attributes for an auto stock trading at 66x forward earnings, which is approximately 10x higher than the industry average."", ""A fourth widely owned stock I'd suggest kicking to the curb right now is leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)."", ""Like the other companies on this list, Coinbase has enjoyed a phenomenal year. A more-than-doubling in Bitcoin, coupled with higher interest rates, which have fueled subscription revenue for the company's stablecoin segment, have sent Coinbase shares higher by 395% in 2023. I repeat, not a typo: three hundred ninety-five percent! But expecting a repeat performance in the upcoming year would be a mistake."", ""To begin with, Coinbase was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in June. Regulators have alleged that Coinbase's crypto trading platform is an unregistered national securities exchange. While there's plenty of gray area regarding the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities, this lawsuit threatens the very fabric of Coinbase's operations. Though these legal problems could take years to play out in federal court, I wouldn't feel comfortable as an investor having this much legal overhang."", 'Another front-and-center problem for Coinbase is that its business is driven more by sentiment and FOMO (that\'s the ""fear of missing out"") than by fundamentals. History shows that crypto exchanges struggle when the most-important underlying tokens -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- aren\'t moving notably higher. Coinbase is far more reliant on consumer sentiment than it is on innovation, which is a dangerous formula.', ""Lastly, changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy could be deleterious to the company's rapid growth in stablecoin subscriptions. With the nation's central bank now projecting multiple rate cuts in 2024, yields from stablecoins could meaningfully decline."", ""The fifth and final ultra-popular stock I'd sell right now is the largest publicly traded company by market cap: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Please, no one send this to Warren Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway, has nearly 48% ($177.3 billion) of its invested assets tied up in Apple stock."", ""Similar to Costco, it's hard to say anything bad about the operating model of a company that's historically delivered for its customers and shareholders. Apple has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-recognized and trusted brand, and is enjoying plenty of success as it steadily transitions to a subscription-driven future. And yet, there are still red flags."", ""Apple's fiscal 2023, which wrapped up on Sept. 30, featured an $11 billion decline (roughly 3%) in year-over-year sales. All of the company's physical product categories -- iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Wearables -- produced lower sales from the prior-year period. While some of this decline can be attributed to moving past the worst of the pandemic (i.e., the 27% year-over-year drop in Mac sales), a $4.9 billion drop off in iPhone sales suggests Apple's iPhone 14 missed the mark on the innovation front."", ""What makes Apple's sales decline even more egregious is that it came with an above-average inflation rate as a tailwind. In other words, even with strong branding and the ability to increase its prices, Apple still wasn't able to grow its sales from the prior fiscal year. Net income also fell by $2.8 billion from the prior-year period, and share repurchases were the only thing that saved Apple from an earnings per share (EPS) decline."", ""The nail in the coffin is Apple's multiple of nearly 30x consensus EPS in fiscal 2024. Paying an aggressive multiple on Apple would be fine if the company were growing at a double-digit rate. However, with its growth engine stalled, Apple's valuation is in nosebleed territory."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

But you can chalk up their momentary fellowship to America\'s copyright laws, under which both are entering the public domain on Jan. 1.', ""That's because both Mickey and Mellors, the Chatterley estate gamekeeper, made their first published appearance in 1928. The applicable law afforded them copyright protection for 95 years, a term expiring with the arrival of 2024."", ""Thousands of other works — literary, dramatic and musical — are entering the copyright-free period of their lives, according to the annual select list compiled by Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain."", 'There are books that were banned for obscenity, a critique of the inhumanity of capitalist society, works from the Harlem Renaissance and a reminder of the lingering trauma from World War I.', 'Jennifer Jenkins, Duke University', 'Among the new entrants are Bertolt Brecht\'s ""The Threepenny Opera,"" Virginia Woolf\'s ""Orlando"" and W.E.B. Du Bois\' ""Dark Princess."" Also Evelyn Waugh\'s first published novel, ""Decline and Fall,"" and A.A. Milne\'s ""House at Pooh Corner,"" which introduced the character of Tigger. (A full list of works shedding their copyright protections on New Year\'s Day can be found at the government\'s Catalogue of Copyright Entries.)', 'All this will inspire new rounds of creativity, as artists acquire the unrestricted right to incorporate elements of previous works in their own creations and publishers gain the right to distribute older works more broadly. The economics favor the transition to the public domain — the expiration of copyright has virtually no effect on the income of creators of these works or their incentive to create, but it does help to inspire future creators.', 'Jenkins points to an explosion of creative glosses on ""The Great Gatsby"" after Fitzgerald\'s novel entered the public domain in 2021: ""New works such as Michael Farris Smith’s prequel \'Nick,\' which tells the backstory of Nick Carraway, \'Self-Made Boys,\' a young-adult \'Great Gatsby remix\' centering on trans love, \'The Gay Gatsby\' and \'The Great Gatsby Undead\' (the zombie edition).""', 'As is the case every year, the list offers ""a snapshot of the cultural struggles of the time, some of which seem decidedly relevant today,"" Jenkins observes.

In the former case, compositions created in 1928 are entering the public domain. These include ""Mack the Knife"" (Brecht and Kurt Weill, from ""The Threepenny Opera""), ""Sonny Boy"" (made famous by Al Jolson) and ""I Wanna Be Loved by You"" (Bert Kalmar, Herbert Stothart and Harry Ruby, made famous by Marilyn Monroe\'s unforgettable rendition in Billy Wilder\'s ""Some Like it Hot."")', ""Read more: Column: AI investors say they'll go broke if they have to pay for copyrighted works.

We Have No Bananas"" (Eddie Cantor and the Sam Lanin Orchestra) and Paul Whiteman\'s version of that all-time earworm, ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers."" As Jenkins cautions, only those specific recordings are freed from copyright; later versions of the same songs might still be protected.', 'Over the centuries, Congress has repeatedly revised copyright law, producing a labyrinthine code difficult even for experts to navigate on behalf of anyone hoping to use creative works. Key revisions tend to lengthen the copyright term, the lawmakers having the mistaken impression that longer terms benefit creators as well as society.', 'The initial copyright act, passed in 1790, provided for a term of 28 years including a 14-year renewal. In 1909, that was extended to 56 years including a 28-year renewal.', ""In 1976, the term was changed to the creator's life plus 50 years. In 1998, Congress passed the Copyright Term Extension Act, which is known as the Sonny Bono Act after its chief promoter on Capitol Hill. That law extended the basic term to life plus 70 years; works for hire (in which a third party owns the rights to a creative work), pseudonymous and anonymous works were protected for 95 years from first publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter."", 'Along the way, Congress extended copyright protection from written works to movies, recordings, performances and ultimately to almost all works, both published and unpublished.', ""The fundamental error in this timeline is the notion that ever-longer protection is a good thing. It's wrong on several counts. To some extent it's based on the theory that creators (or their heirs) should be entitled to income from a work well into the distant future in order to incentivize creative artists to create."", 'But the truth is that the income stream from all but a tiny minority of published works largely evaporates after the first few years, and what does arrive decades in the future has a minuscule present value at the time of creation. The 20-year extension in the 1998 law, as 17 economists (including five Nobel laureates) wrote in a 2002 Supreme Court brief, provided ""no significant incentive to create new works"" and arguably less for existing works.', 'In fact, constraining entry into the public domain is a drag on creativity.', 'Read more: Column: These historic works are coming free from copyright. Why did it take so long? ', 'Once a work enters the public domain, Jenkins says, ""community theaters can screen the films. Youth orchestras can perform the music publicly, without paying licensing fees. Online repositories such as the Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Google Books, and the New York Public Library can make works fully available online. This helps enable access to cultural materials that might otherwise be lost to history. ... Anyone can rescue them from obscurity and make them available, where we can all discover, enjoy, and breathe new life into them.""', 'In some cases, extended copyright seems to work against the public interest. Consider the stringent control exercised by the estate of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — mostly his children — over his speeches and writings such as the “I Have a Dream” speech he delivered in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 28, 1963.', 'On the day it was delivered, the speech was eligible for copyright protection through 2019. Congressional revisions extended the speech\'s copyright until 2058, nearly a century after King delivered it to a massive crowd at the Lincoln Memorial and untold more viewers on television. Filmmaker Ava DuVernay had to put rewritten and paraphrased lines into the mouth of the actor portraying King in her film “Selma,"" about the 1965 protests in support of the Voting Rights Act.', ""DuVernay's options were limited because the King estate had sold the film rights to Steven Spielberg for a still-unproduced project. Even had she acquired the rights, she said, that might have required giving the family a voice in how King was portrayed, constraining her own artistic choices."", 'As I observed a year ago, if it was vanishingly unlikely that the posthumous 95-year term in the Sonny Bono Act would be an incentive to any living artist or writer, it was a boon for the Walt Disney Co.', 'At the time, Disney was facing the expiration of rights to the earliest films featuring Mickey Mouse and the looming cutoff of the royalty spigot, so it placed its considerable political and financial weight behind the extension and got what it wanted.', 'The irony of the term extension is that Disney, which pushed so hard to keep its own creations out of the public domain, is perhaps our most assiduous exploiter of, yes, the public domain.', ""Read more: Column: 'Winnie-the-Pooh' (born 1926) is finally in the public domain, a reminder that our copyright system is absurd"", 'The core material of some of its most successful and profitable movies comes from Hans Christian Andersen, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll and Charles Perrault — often freely reimagined and rewritten by Disney artists and writers.', 'Disney\'s ""Fantasia"" mined musical history for compositions by Bach and Beethoven, but if the copyright terms Disney pushed for in 1998 were in place when the film was made in 1940, the compositions used in the film by Ponchielli, Dukas, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky would still be under copyright protection. Disney did license ""The Rite of Spring"" from Igor Stravinsky—for $6,000—because it was then still under copyright overseas. But if Disney had to pay licensing fees to those other composers, the film probably could not have been made.', 'That brings us back to Mickey. The work entering the public domain is ""Steamboat Willie,"" the Disney short in which he made his first public appearance. It\'s proper to note that only the version of Mickey in that film is making the transition to the public domain. Features added to the mouse in his long evolution are still copyrighted. Those include his white gloves (added in 1929) and possibly some artifacts of colorized versions, such as his red shorts. Creators using Mickey Mouse may be well advised to stick with the ur-Mickey in ""Steamboat Willie.""', ""Another caution involves Disney's ownership of Mickey as a trademark. Any use of Mickey that might confuse consumers into thinking it's endorsed or produced by Disney is a violation. Trademarks don't automatically expire."", 'In other words, celebrate the liberation of Mickey Mouse into the public domain if you wish.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Colgate-Palmolive had US$8.72b of debt, an increase on US$8.25b, over one year. However, it does have US$1.20b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$7.53b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.60b due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.0b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.20b and US$1.58b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$12.9b.', ""Of course, Colgate-Palmolive has a titanic market capitalization of US$64.6b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Colgate-Palmolive's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.8 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 15.6 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive saw its EBIT slide 2.1% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Colgate-Palmolive recorded free cash flow worth 69% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""Colgate-Palmolive's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. All these things considered, it appears that Colgate-Palmolive can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you should know about."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Today we will analyse the most recent data on United Rentals’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals ', 'The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 5.83% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Rentals today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $539.07, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because United Rentals’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market.

To be sure, this segment has lost some of its attractiveness over roughly the past two years as the Federal Reserve began earnestly hiking borrowing costs. But with that narrative possibly shifting, it may be time to pivot our portfolio as well.', 'While it’s not a perfect correlation – nothing ever is in the equities sector – higher borrowing costs tend to cloud passive-income providers, especially high-yield dividend stocks. Basically, when investors seek higher dividend rewards, they usually must absorb higher risks. However, if the yield on U.S. government bonds start rising, a competition effect occurs.', 'Basically, the government competes with the capital market and let’s face it: for stability, you can’t beat Uncle Sam. But if this narrative will fade due to interest rate cuts, then high-yield dividend stocks should regain relevance.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Of course, we just don’t know what will actually materialize. However, if you’re convinced about dovishness next year, these might be the high-yield dividend stocks that will benefit the most.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'What it is: A juggernaut in the technology and innovation fields, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is no stranger to most investors. However, over the past several years, the enterprise known as “Big Blue” faded against younger competitors. Still, that circumstance appears to be shifting as IBM witnessed a (relatively) impressive rise this year, gaining almost 18% in the trailing half-year period.', 'Relevance: While the company may have been overshadowed, it still levers considerable acumen in the fields of AI and machine learning. As well, it researches and develops applications leveraging blockchain technology. That could be a surprisingly niche growth sector. Per MarketsandMarkets, the segment reached a valuation of $7.4 billion in 2022. By end of 2027, it could generate revenue over $94 billion.', 'Pros: Right now, IBM offers a forward dividend yield of 4.09%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the company commands 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, something that management won’t want to give up.', 'Cons: While an attractive example of high-yield dividend stocks, IBM has a history of disappointing investors.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An international self-storage company, the easy-to-recognize brand Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Per its public profile, the company is the largest brand of self-storage services in the U.S. While the share price has been choppy this year, PSA managed to gain about 6% since the January opener. It currently carries a market capitalization of $51 billion.', 'Relevance: With the unique dynamics tied to the Covid-19 crisis, self-storage units may see increased demand in the years ahead as they facilitate downsizing. Essentially, customers can live in smaller residences while storing their bulky possessions in the underlying facilities. According to Mordor Intelligence, the sector should see slow and steady expansion (a compound annual growth rate of 4.37%) from 2022 to 2028.', 'Pros: Public Storage offers a forward yield of 4.14%. Now, the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 107.97%, though it’s important to remember it’s a REIT. Financially, Public Storage benefits from strong revenue growth and consistent profitability.', 'Cons: Analysts don’t seem particularly enthused about PSA, seeing a slight decrease in the share price.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Leveraging a recognizable brand in the broader food and beverage ecosystem, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America, per its public profile. It’s also the fifth largest in the world, thus benefiting from a massive footprint. In terms of perceived safety ahead of interest rate cuts, KHC makes a strong case for high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, KHC ranks highly in part because it’s one of legendary investor Warren Buffet’s favorites. In November, I stated that shares were undervalued. At the time, KHC traded hands at a forward earnings multiple of 11.34X. Recently, that stat has increased some to 12.33x. The good news? Relative to the median sector value of 15.2x, Kraft Heinz is, at least on paper, a discounted opportunity among high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Pros: Presently, Kraft Heinz carries a forward dividend yield of 4.37%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 52.8%. The Oracle is doing Oracle things.', 'Cons: If you’re looking for a yield-and-capital-gains combo, don’t. Analysts only see 2% upside.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A “sinful” example of high-yield dividend stocks, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) understandably carries a controversial profile. As a tobacco giant, there’s no amount of bovine scatology that it can distribute to ameliorate criticism. Hey, if you want brainwashing, you have to go to the best: the Kremlin’s disinformation unit. However, it’s surprisingly relevant.', 'Relevance: Relevant, really? Haven’t global smoking prevalence declined significantly over the past several years? You’re absolutely correct but as Tobacco Atlas points out, in many countries, prevalence did not change. Worse yet from an anti-tobacco advocacy standpoint, prevalence increased. Another factor that benefits PM as one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy is the vaping industry. That has skyrocketed in popularity.', 'Pros: Currently, Philip Morris carries a forward yield of 5.5%, well above the consumer staples sector as mentioned above. Also, the company features 16 years of consecutive dividend increases, a stat management will want to keep increasing.', 'Cons: PM hasn’t gone anywhere since 2021 and that was when interest rate cuts were the norm.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A multinational telecommunications conglomerate, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a huge player in the 5G rollout. Thanks to its ownership and operation of an extensive network infrastructure – including a robust wireless network that covers a large portion of the U.S. – Verizon is critical for business in the modern age. It also features a massive market cap of over $157 billion.', 'Relevance: As stated above, Verizon represents a critical cog in the broader telecom ecosystem. Further, many of its individual units enjoy a burgeoning total addressable market. For example, the 5G services sector may hit a valuation of $121.8 billion by the end of this year. By 2028, this segment could soar to over $1 trillion. That comes out to a stunning CAGR of 52.4%, per MarketsandMarkets.', 'Pros: At the moment, Verizon offers a forward yield of 7.12%, making it one of the enticing high-yield dividend stocks. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable given the generous yield at 57.38%.', 'Cons: Again, if you’re looking for a yield-and-gains combo, don’t. Analysts on average see upside potential of only 5.5%.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Canada, Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) specializes in the midstream component of the hydrocarbon energy value chain. This segment involves storage and transportation, thus representing the link between the upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing) components. Given its vast network of pipelines that cover thousands of miles across Canada and several U.S. states, it’s an integral part of the North American economy.', 'Relevance: While there’s much talk about electric vehicles and alternative energy sources, the world continues to run on oil. Without getting into conspiratorial realms, the reality is that much (if not most) of the conflicts in the modern age have at least tangentially been related to oil. Cynically, this harsh framework implies that oil will be with us for longer than expected.', 'Pros: Companies like Enbridge form part of the backbone of the economy. Thus, it makes a credible case for high-yield dividend stocks. To be sure, Enbridge commands a forward yield of 7.5%. Still, watch out for that ultra-high payout ratio of 130.52%.', 'Cons: Analysts aren’t particularly convinced with ENB, pegging it a consensus hold.', 'Source: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Headquartered in Tainan City, Taiwan, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading supplier and fabless manufacturer. While it might not be a household name on this side of the Pacific, Himax manufactures display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers. These products are vital for television sets, laptops, monitors and mobile phones.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where people no longer watch TV nor use laptops nor mobile phones, Himax is relevant. More than likely, it’s permanently so. If you want to put some numbers to it, Statista points out that the IC market in total will generate revenue of $443.3 billion by the end of this year. Further, the sector will continue to expand at a CAGR of 7.87% to 2027.', 'Pros: Himax offers a forward yield of 7.89%, which is massive. It’s also undervalued, carrying a forward earnings multiple of only 9.77x.', 'Cons: HIMX suffers from recent disappointing performances.

Perhaps Munger's biggest legacy? Spurring Buffett to switch from investing in very cheap stocks to investing in high-quality businesses at reasonable prices."", ""That's because whatever a stock may do in the near term or whatever its current valuation multiple, Munger taught us that over a long time period, stocks tend to return close to the return on capital of the underlying business."", 'In a 1995 speech, Munger said:', ""Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6% return -- even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result."", ""That's why for investors truly looking at the long term, a focus on quality, competitive advantage, and a high return on invested capital (ROIC) is crucial to success. And it's also why the following three tech stocks should be targets for your new investment dollars today, even after impressive year-to-date runs."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may be the second largest stock in the world, but that doesn't mean Microsoft can't continue rewarding shareholders. After all, Microsoft was the largest company in the world in the year 2000. Despite massive gains since then, it's only the second-largest today. So... lots of room to grow."", 'Over the past 25 years, Microsoft has always had a very high return on capital by virtue of its dominant position in Windows operating systems, the Office enterprise software suite, and the Dynamics enterprise resource planning system. But over the past decade, the company has had a renaissance under CEO Satya Nadella, who took over as CEO almost exactly 10 years ago.', 'Under Nadella, Microsoft has muscled its way into a strong No. 2 position in the all-important cloud computing infrastructure market, with some analysts saying it could become the No. 1 cloud infrastructure-as-a-service vendor by the end of this decade.', ""That would probably come about through Microsoft's savvy investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. That foresight has catapulted Microsoft to the lead in the artificial-intelligence race. And despite some recent turmoil at OpenAI, it's still regarded as the AI leader. Given that we're still in the early innings of the AI races, there should be a lot of growth ahead for both OpenAI and Microsoft together."", ""While AI and cloud get the lion's share of attention, investors also shouldn't overlook Microsoft's other acquisitions during Nadella's tenure, such as the 2016 purchase of LinkedIn, or this year's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The fact that Microsoft was still able to acquire such a large company despite its already massive size speaks volumes about Microsoft's still-hungry attitude despite its historical success."", ""The best part? Every one of Microsoft's businesses is insanely profitable. In fact, Microsoft's overall operating margin stands at a ridiculously high 47.6% over the past 12 months, with a return on equity of 39.1%. And keep in mind, this is during a somewhat soft year for enterprise software spending."", ""No wonder Microsoft has a higher credit rating than even the U.S. government. While that doesn't mean Microsoft stock is totally risk-free, it's probably the closest thing to it in the stock market today."", ""Unlike Microsoft, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is not reliably profitable. In fact, over the past 12 months, the company has generated an operating loss of $6.2 billion. That's because the memory industry is in a severe bust following the pandemic -- its worst since the Great Financial Crisis."", 'So why is Micron a tech stock to buy and hold for the long term? It comes down to scarcity. Since the memory industry is so challenging, with severe boom-and-bust cycles, the global memory industry has consolidated to just three large DRAM companies and six large NAND flash companies.', ""Micron plays in both types of memory, but it has nearly three-quarters of its revenue coming from DRAM. And while DRAM is the most consolidated of the two types of memory, it's also the one that's likely to benefit the most from artificial intelligence."", ""That's because AI training systems need massive amounts of volatile data to process in order to train algorithms. That requires a very premium and high-intensity type of DRAM called high-bandwidth memory. Micron will be ramping up its cutting-edge HM3E generation in early 2024, which management boasts will have 10% better performance and 30% lower power consumption compared with the best solutions on the market today."", 'Meanwhile, the industry appears to be turning up. All three major DRAM players have cut back on their spending and reallocated equipment toward leading technology nodes. That supply cut, along with AI-driven demand, is allowing prices to rise again.', 'Micron reported fiscal first quarter earnings last week, with revenue up 18% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of expectations. While that was impressive, Micron guided for another 12% quarter-over-quarter growth in the current quarter, with profitability inflecting upward.', 'So while Micron is inking losses today, it appears the industrywide supply cutbacks and AI-fueled demand are sowing the seed of the next ""boom."" Keep in mind, during the 2018 memory boom, Micron\'s ROIC reached as high as 40%.', 'Given we are at the early stages of the next upturn and the industry is unlikely to see a demand blowup like the post-pandemic downturn, competitively advantaged Micron is another stock to which one can allocate long-term dollars today.', 'Of the three mentioned stocks here, ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) has the highest efficiency, with a stunning 76.3% return on equity over the past 12 months.', 'One can think of ASML as a key ""pick and shovel"" player in the AI gold rush. In fact, all leading-edge semiconductors manufactured on nodes 7nm and lower need ASML\'s extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. What\'s so attractive about ASML is that it has a monopoly on EUV, as the technology is insanely difficult to pull off. In fact, EUV development took over 20 years and billions of dollars in research and development, with partner contributions, to bring it to market in the first place.', ""EUV is required for all of the latest AI chips, including Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market-leading H100. Meanwhile, the upcoming H200 and B100 slated for 2024 will also need plenty of EUV machines.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the RTD market in America, the demand for lower tax rates on canned cocktails, and the new RTD cocktail in the market, and go directly to 5 Most Popular RTDs in America.\xa0', 'As the name suggests, RTD or ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages are premixed drinks that are ready to be consumed immediately and typically have a lower alcoholic content compared to traditional liquors and spirits, and even some beers. Aside from being super convenient, one of the major factors contributing to the rise of RTDs is the variety of flavors and options they offer. Various brands have stepped up over the years, responding to consumer demand for a wider range of flavors and ingredients, and have introduced a variety of options, including pre-mixed cocktails, hard seltzers, and spiked sodas. RTDs are amongst the most innovative and creative drinks in the market, forever changing, adapting, and growing the potential for a category.', 'The United States is by far the largest market for RTDs in the world. According to IWSR, the country sold the equivalent of 387 million nine-liter cases in 2021, more than double the volumes in second-placed Japan. Although the American RTD market was flat last year, ending a period of rapid volume growth, it rose in value by 6% due to a combination of inflation and premiumization, reaching $18.2 billion. The market is expected to be valued at $21.1 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 1% during the forecast period.\xa0', 'While malt-based RTDs still retain a 91% share by volume in the American RTD market, spirit-based RTDs grew by 51% in 2021, approximately double the growth of the wine-and malt-based categories. As mentioned in our article – 25 Most Popular Spirits in the World –\xa0 the spirits-based RTDs are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% in volume in the U.S. by 2025.\xa0', 'As consumers continue to look for ‘healthier’ alcohol options, spirit RTDs are responding with spirit-based seltzers with natural flavors and fewer calories. Spirit RTDs like Owl’s Brew’s Tea-based Seltzers claim to be alcoholic drinks that are good for health, benefiting from the ‘health halo’ created by ingredients like vitamins, anti-oxidants, and probiotics', 'The spirits industry has an effort underway to lobby states to lower taxes on canned cocktails to more closely mimic those placed on beer and hard seltzer. Since distilled spirits face the stiffest tax rates due to their high alcohol content, canned cocktails are also taxed heavily at every level. However, distillers argue that Ready-to-Drink cocktails have similar alcohol content as beer and hard seltzer and are treated unfairly just because their drinks contain spirits. As we stated in our article – 20 States with the Highest Alcohol and Beer Tax – the U.S. consumption of canned cocktails grew 52.7% in 2020 compared to the previous year, accounting for 6.9% of the total volume in the alcoholic ready-to-drink category. The higher sales have encouraged liquor companies to take the offensive in a fight for tax parity.\xa0', 'As a result, several states have already taken steps to level the field in favor of the canned cocktails, and thus support the country’s burgeoning craft distilling industry. An example of this is Michigan, where in 2021, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed SB 144 – a bill to increase market access to RTD cocktails for adult consumers and reduce the tax on these spirits-based products. Under the new law, the tax rate on RTD cocktails up to 13.5% ABV has decreased from $0.48 to $0.30/liter.', 'A recent new spirit-based RTD offering that popped up in the market is the good ol’ Jack & Coke. Although the classic drink has been a quintessential serve at every bar for a long time, the much-loved cocktail is now also available in the form of a pre-mixed, canned RTD – courtesy of a joint venture between the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).\xa0', 'Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD made its U.S. debut in March this year in 12-oz. cans (7% ABV), and Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also became available in May. Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) took a test-and learn-approach for the initial launch, applying lessons from a single-country rollout in Mexico to a global scaling strategy, bringing the product to 13 countries in 12 months.\xa0', 'Both the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) rank among the Largest Beverage Companies in the World in 2023.\xa0', 'With that said, here are the Most Popular RTDs in the U.S. in 2023.\xa0', 'A close-up on several cans of freshly brewed beer in a commercial brewery.', 'To collect data for this article, we have referred to sources such as Beverage Industry, BevAlc Insights, VinePair, Reddit etc., looking for the Most Popular RTD Brands in the U.S. We picked brands that appeared at least twice in these sources, assigned them a score based on their number of appearances, and ranked them accordingly.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Compared with other RTD beverages on the market, BuzzBallz's products are notably different due to their spherical shape.\xa0"", ""Despite the overtly adult advertising, watchdog groups like Ohio's Drug Free Action Alliance and Alcohol Justice have accused the brand of deliberately marketing to underage drinkers, stating that the cans look like toys, and the color palette is made to target kids."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 3', 'A recent entry in the ready-to-drink category, the Death & Co canned cocktails capture the vibrancy of a freshly made cocktail.

To be fair, even the most influential voices in government are hinting at a positive outcome. Nevertheless, nothing is guaranteed.', 'For example, Wall Street has responded positively to the Federal Reserve’s apparent willingness to shift monetary policy. After roughly two years of aggressive interest rate hikes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees the possibility of lowering borrowing costs next year. On paper, that doesn’t sound like the most ideal time to consider stable stocks. Rather, investors may want to consider higher-risk growth opportunities.', 'Still, let’s consider the context. With the U.S. jobs market continuing to print robust numbers, the idea of rate cuts seems premature. After all, that would imply expanding the inflation problem, not addressing it. As well, a global recession – which is a non-zero probability – would hurt risk-on assets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With so many questions, investors should at least consider these bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR', 'What it is: Presenting about as self-explanatory of a company name as you can get, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) easily qualifies as one of the bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. After all, the underlying business is a dirty job but someone has to do it. It’s not particularly sexy but WM doesn’t leave investors stranded for too long. Since the January opener, shares gained over 13%.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a world where humans don’t produce trash, WM should belong on your list of stable stocks. Again, it’s not a sexy growth opportunity. But what WM does is to provide confidence heading into an uncertain future. In particular, the company benefits from slow-and-steady revenue growth. Also, its gross margin comes in at around 37% to 38%, in line with historical norms.', 'Pros: Analysts appreciate the reliability of WM, rating it a moderate buy with a $182.44 price target. It also offers a modest dividend yield of 1.6%.', 'Cons: Basically, WM is the investment market’s equivalent of a prevent defense. You buy it to secure the win, not necessarily to score a 70-yard bomb.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. Its biggest subsidiary is the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, a regulated gas and electric utility firm. Fundamentally, PEG should benefit from the natural monopoly effect. Essentially, utilities are too deeply entrenched in their chosen markets to be displaced.', 'Relevance: If you’re looking for bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024, it’s difficult to overlook the utility space. According to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, experts project that next year, electricity prices will remain steady. Further, sales should rise about 2%. We’re not talking about groundbreaking stuff here. Instead, it’s all about the consistent and predictable demand profile.', 'Pros: For bargain-hunting investors, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.98X. That’s conspicuously lower than the sector median of 14.44x. Also, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $64.90 price target.', 'Cons: The long-term chart performance of PEG has been slow indeed so it’s good if you’re literally seeking stable stocks.', 'Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A financial services giant, Visa (NYSE:V) of course is known universally as a payment card provider. Per its public profile, the company facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. While the sector presents risks, V has performed well, basically matching the performance of the S&P 500 this year.', 'Relevance: If borrowing costs decline as the Fed seems to be hoping for, then Visa could rise on boosted consumer sentiment. Under any inflationary cycle (“regular” inflation up to hyperinflation), money today is worth more than money tomorrow. So, an incentive exists to spend that money today. However, if we fall into rough waters, cynically, consumers will turn to credit cards to make ends meet. That’s already happening, actually.', 'Pros: Visa enjoys steady revenue growth and is consistently profitable thanks to its robust margins. Analysts also rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $281.74 price target.', 'Cons: With U.S. credit card debt collectively topping $1 trillion, a fundamental question exists about the viability of Visa as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'What it is: A company that truly needs no introduction, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the fast-food industry. Indeed, I would argue that it’s a cultural icon representing American-style capitalism at its finest. After all, the brand’s debut in the Soviet Union likely helped thaw the Cold War. Now, the company is seeking to reboot itself with its CosMc’s spinoff.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, I believe McDonald’s makes a great case as one of the stable stocks that could rise amid the challenges. With CosMc’s, the Golden Arches is putting Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) right in its crosshairs. By offering the customization options that consumers of Generation Z crave at a lower price point, MCD almost seems a no-brainer. I don’t want to get ahead of myself but the new initiative is exciting.', 'Pros: Ironically, MCD isn’t much of a discount in terms of valuation. However, the company enjoys solid revenue growth and consistent profitability via excellent margins. And who knows? MCD could be undervalued based on the future potential of CosMc’s. Thus, it’s one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Cons: Despite the excitement over the spinoff, it will be tough to displace Starbucks.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An American pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a range of compelling therapeutics. Per its public profile, the company’s primary product is Humira, which is approved to treat various autoimmune diseases. Further, thanks to its purchase of Allergan, AbbVie now controls Botox, which should be a big winner over the long run. Thus, it’s one of the stable stocks to consider.', 'Relevance: Generally speaking, blue-chip pharmaceuticals offer a level of economic insulation. Cynically, when people suffer from critical conditions, they often do whatever it takes to get better. For ABBV specifically, the global botulinum toxin – which is what Botox is – will reach a valuation of $11.1 billion at year’s end. Further, the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, boding well for AbbVie.', 'Pros: Thanks to its robust profitability metrics, AbbVie offers a solid dividend yield of 3.84%. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $172.50 price target.', 'Cons: Admittedly, ABBV hasn’t had the best performance this year as one of the bulletproof stocks.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Another company that needs no introduction, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a computer software and hardware giant. While the company over the years has seen its dominance challenged from enterprises like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the reality is that Microsoft owns the professional office application ecosystem. After all, when was the last time you forwarded a Numbers spreadsheet rather than an Excel file?', 'Relevance: Again, while Microsoft has seen challenges to its digital hegemony, it still dominates in key areas. For example, in terms of desktop operating systems, Microsoft Windows commands a nearly 69% market share. In other words, the brand is practically ingrained in the broader digital space. Also, with Microsoft Office, the company enjoys consistent and predictable revenue growth.', 'Pros: While not the most exciting idea among bulletproof stocks, Microsoft brings to the table strong revenue growth and consistent profitability. As well, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $422.70 average price target.', 'Cons: MSFT already enjoyed a strong year in 2023 thanks to its initiatives in artificial intelligence. Therefore, it’s questionable how much it can rise in 2024.', 'Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A supermarket and multi-department store operator, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a stalwart in the grocery store industry. Fundamentally, KR attracts investors because of its everyday demand. Unless humans find a way to survive and thrive without convenient access to food and water, Kroger should rank among the stable stocks to buy for 2024.', 'Relevance: While I don’t expect meme traders to clamor over Kroger, the company should benefit no matter what happens with the economy. Let’s say we enter a decisive bull market. Fine, people will still need to eat. If instead, we fall into a recession, Kroger should benefit from the trade-down effect. That is, households will likely eschew eating out at restaurants and cook at home, saving money.', 'Pros: One of the main factors favoring KR as one of the bulletproof stocks is the valuation. Trading at 10.14x forward earnings, it’s well below the sector median of 15.4x. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $51.36 price target.', 'Cons: Since June of last year, KR hasn’t moved much so expectations need to be kept in check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But over time, quality dividend stocks rarely lose their luster -- especially when a company has what it takes to grow earnings and the dividend over time. Earnings growth, paired with dividend growth, can boost the investment thesis, which can open the door to capital gains on top of dividend income.', ""Here's why Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), Leggett & Platt (NYSE: LEG), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) are three dividend stocks worth buying now."", 'Lee Samaha (Whirlpool): The home appliance maker has had a difficult year. Rising interest rates have hit the housing market and consumer spending in general. In addition, ongoing cost pressures have eroded profit margin performance. As such, its earnings per share are set to decline by nearly 20% to $15.71, according to Wall Street estimates.', 'The bad news is out of the way; it\'s time to focus on the stock\'s value proposition. In response to weakening market conditions, management is cutting costs and is on track to deliver $800 million in cost cuts in 2023. Management believes there will be some ""carryover"" in the cost-cutting into 2024.', ""In addition, Whirlpool is set to sell its European domestic appliance business next year, removing itself from a market it's struggled in."", ""While all these operational improvements are taking place, the U.S. housing market looks likely to improve year over year in 2024, not least with the prospect of lower interest rates. Whirlpool's management is targeting $500 million in free cash flow\xa0in 2023, and that will easily cover its $385 million dividend payout. Throw in some margin recovery in 2024 due to costs, exiting unfavorable markets, and the possibility of lower raw material costs, and Whirlpool's dividend looks sustainable."", ""Scott Levine (Leggett & Platt): It's not often that investors can find companies on firm financial footing that offer ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are on sale. But that's exactly the opportunity that Leggett & Platt stock, along with its forward yield of 6.8%, offers income investors right now. Those looking to prosper from a passive income powerhouse in 2024 -- and for many years beyond -- would be wise to add Leggett & Platt to their must-buy list."", ""In addition to its impressive 140-year history, Leggett & Platt, a manufacturer of bedding components and automotive seating, distinguishes itself as a Dividend King, having hiked its dividend for 52 consecutive years. Achieving this rank is no easy feat, and it suggests that the company's dedication to rewarding shareholders is embedded in its ethos -- a valued quality for investors who intend to buy and hold for the long term."", ""Understandably, circumspect investors may balk at the stock's ultra-high yield, fearing that the payout isn't sustainable. But this concern is quickly allayed when checking in with the company's payout ratio. Over the past 10 years, Leggett & Platt has averaged a conservative 68% payout ratio. Additionally, the company's strong free cash flow often exceeds that which the company returns to shareholders in dividends."", 'With shares of Leggett & Platt currently valued at 6.1 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 11.3, now seems like a great time for investors to procure some prodigious passive income with Leggett & Platt stock.', ""Daniel Foelber (Starbucks): When considering no-brainer dividend stocks for next year, you want to choose a company that blends a track record of dividend raises, upside potential, value, and growth. It's hard to find all those attributes from a single company -- let alone two or three. But Starbucks has them all."", 'Over the last month, Starbucks stock is down 7.5% compared to a 5.6% gain in the S&P 500.', ""At first, Starbucks enjoyed a nice spike from blowout results, including record-high quarterly revenue. However, sentiment shifted, and Starbucks stock began stagnating or going down despite the market's best period of the year."", ""So why the underperformance? The short-term reason is that Starbucks is facing some internal struggles -- namely, ongoing labor-related differences with its employees. Starbucks released a memo to its partners, customers, and stakeholders on Dec. 11 that expressed some of these concerns. Starbucks is trying to improve its relationship with its employees through opportunities and higher pay. Some may doubt Starbucks' ability to raise wages and sustain its growth without impacting its margins. But Starbucks depends heavily on its workers, and its future depends on the efficiency of its stores."", ""After all, Starbucks' master plan is to grow its rewards membership, boost mobile ordering, increase ticket volumes, and process more orders -- all of which rely heavily on its employees being able to make more drinks (and process more complicated orders) faster. So, paying its employees more should be the right long-term move."", ""As for stock's valuation, Starbucks trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.3, which isn't cheap, but it's a reasonable price for a high-quality business like Starbucks -- especially if it sustains its growth in the years to come."", 'Starbucks is also an underrated dividend stock, having raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years. The raises are sizable, too, and they have helped the company grow into an ultra-reliable dividend stock that currently sports a 2.3% yield.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Whirlpool wasn't one of them.
