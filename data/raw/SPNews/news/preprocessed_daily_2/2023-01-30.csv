This investment will take place over the next five years. The company will add capacity at its existing facility in Pampa, TX, focusing on expanding CBT’s CCA production in the United States.This investment is expected to enhance CBT’s leadership position in the market and support the transition to EVs. The first phase of the project will include an investment of about $75-$90 million and is likely to add about 15,000 metric tons of annual CCA capacity in Texas.The decarbonization of economies and the U.S. government’s plans and targeted efforts to build an EV supply chain have led to the importance of EVs. Federal and state governments’ actions to implement programs like grants, loans and tax incentives form part of these initiatives. The company believes that these efforts will open the doors for potential funding opportunities to expand its CCA production capacities.The growth potential of important battery materials, like CCAs for EVs, in the United States is expected to surpass its global demand growth, which is likely to be 20-30% over the next five years. As EV penetration increases in the coming years, CBT remains committed to meeting the growing demand for EVs from its customers in the United States and helping onshore critical battery components such as CCAs.CCAs provide electric conductivity to active materials and are an essential component for lithium-ion batteries. Cabot’s global presence in manufacturing assets, technology labs and commercial resources will support its customers through regional supply security. The company also holds the broadest portfolios of CCAs to deliver optimal performance, some of which include conductive carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon nanostructures (CNS) etc.Cabot’s CCA project, which is likely to commence at the end of 2025, is expected to add about 75 high-quality jobs in the United States. The company also operates a research and development facility and pilot plant in Pampa, which focuses on developing new process technology for batteries and other applications. The company plans to make additional investments to broaden the footprint of its U.S. manufacturing and technology over the next five years, along with investment in new CNT powder and dispersion capacity to extend its portfolio of innovative products for battery applications.  Cabot’s expects that its technology position and its existing network of plants and talent will position it uniquely to support the growth expectations of its customers. The company also expects its planned investment to solidify its position as a global leader in CCAs for lithium-ion battery applications.CBT’s shares have gained 34.7% in the past year, outperforming industry’s growth of 2.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCabot expects strength in the Reinforcement Materials segment and above-market growth in Battery Materials in fiscal 2023.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) share price has soared 170% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Cintas There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Cintas achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 22% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Cintas has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Cintas will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Cintas' TSR for the last 5 years was 184%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Cintas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 23% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cintas better, we need to consider many other factors.

WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao CBD.Industry: SupermarketLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2045237/3-supermarket-stocks-to-watch-on-impressive-industry-trendsPlayers in the Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry are gaining on their constant efforts to improve store and online operations. Companies have been stepping up their delivery and payment options alongside strengthening assortments. That said, these investments and increased supply-chain costs remain a threat to margins.Nevertheless, solid store traffic and online demand, along with robust efforts to bolster omnichannel operations keep Walmart Inc., The Kroger Co. and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao well-placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry includes supermarket retailers, which offer grocery, health and beauty aids, household chemicals, electronics, stationery, automotive accessories, hardware and paint, sporting goods, fabrics and crafts, entertainment products, home furnishings and much more. Players in this industry operate through various formats such as supermarkets, multi-department stores, retail stores, discount stores, supercenters, hypermarkets and warehouse clubs.Nevertheless, food retail accounts for a chunk of their business. The industry has undergone a significant transformation over the years, with e-commerce playing a strong role. Given consumers’ rising preference for online shopping, industry participants have been enhancing pickup and delivery services as well as offering easy payment options.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Supermarkets IndustryStrong Omnichannel Efforts: Supermarket companies have been exploring every nook and cranny to solidify store and online operations. To this end, they have been focused on store improvisation, merchandise enhancement, prudent pricing strategy and efforts to replenish assortments.Story continuesAdditionally, companies have been pushing the edge out of the envelope to bolster online operations. In fact, pandemic-led social distancing has taken online shopping to another level – causing industry players to constantly step up their efforts in this arena through meaningful buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems.Companies have been benefiting from their same-day delivery, buy online and pick-up in-store, curbside pickup as well as contactless payment options. Companies’ concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience certainly keep them well-placed for growth.Favorable Demand to Stay: Supermarket players have been gaining from favorable demand (especially online) for essentials due to the pandemic-induced elevated at-home consumption. Incidentally, higher dine-at-home and work-from-home practices have boosted demand for staple products, especially groceries, cleaning supplies, and medicines. Although demand has moderated from the initial spike, it remains higher than the pre-pandemic levels.In fact, even with things opening up and curbs being lifted, the pent-up demand trend is likely to stay in the near term, as a number of Americans still prefer to work and cook at home. This calls for supermarket players to continue making investments toward innovative offerings and merchandising to make the most of such trends.Pressure on Margins: Supermarket players are facing margin pressure owing to elevated COVID-related costs. These include additional employee payments and benefits along with costs associated with upgraded safety and sanitization to protect the health of customers and team members. Apart from this, companies’ constant technological investments to bolster online operations, elevated supply-chain and wage expenses pose a threat to margins. Continued price investments and other promotion activities also come at the cost of margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Strong ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #9, which places it in the top 4% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually becoming more confident about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of August 2022, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current fiscal has increased 2.4%.Let’s look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail – Supermarkets industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as well as the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector over the past year.The industry has gained 14.9% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 1.9%. Meanwhile, the broader sector has risen 3.9% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing consumer staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 20.13X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.01X and the sector’s 22.28X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.48X and as low as 16.23X, with the median being at 20.5X.3 Supermarket Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnThe Kroger Co.: A dominant position among the nation’s largest grocery retailers enables The Kroger Co. to boost market share with the expansion of plant-based products, digital coupons, order online pick-up in-store and smart shopping lists. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been focusing on a no-contact delivery option, low-contact pick-up service and ship-to-home orders. Apart from this, the company’s “Restock Kroger” program, involving investments in the omni-channel platform, identifying margin-rich alternative profit streams, merchandise optimization, and lowering of expenses has been gaining traction.Further, the company’s Customer 1st strategy enriches consumers’ shopping experience and convinces them to return to stores. KR has seen upward estimate revisions for its current fiscal year’s bottom line over the past 60 days by 1.7%. This Cincinnati-based retailer has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1% as well as a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.4%, on average. Shares of KR have dipped 2.2% in the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Walmart: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been benefiting from its strong omnichannel efforts and last-mile delivery capabilities. Walmart’s e-commerce business and omni-channel penetration have been increasing all the more amid the pandemic-led social distancing.  The supermarket giant has been gaining from its sturdy comp sales record, which, in turn, is driven by its constant expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce performance.  The company has been focused on store remodeling in an attempt to upgrade them with advanced in-store and digital innovations.Walmart has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Additionally, it is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has long been a major contributor to e-commerce sales. The consensus mark for current fiscal-year earnings has gone up by 2 cents to $6.08 per share in the past 60 days. Shares of WMT have increased 12.5% in the past six months.Companhia Brasileira:  This Zacks Rank #3 company is gaining on its digital transformation efforts in the face of consumers’ increased preference for online shopping. Certainly, CBD’s delivery models, including same-day delivery — Express and Click &amp; Collect, Traditional or next-day delivery, and Last Mile or next-hour delivery — James Delivery and Open Platform have been working well. Apart from this, Companhia Brasileira’s focus on store expansion is noteworthy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 bottom line has declined from 34 cents to 26 cents over the past 30 days.Shares of this Brazilian retailer of food, clothing, home appliances, electronics, and other products have rallied 35% in the past six months.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It reinforces measures implemented last year after several buyers skipped out on payments for oil, which provides most of the South American country's income.After taking the helm, Tellechea launched an extensive audit of supply contracts, according to a written order to PDVSA seen by Reuters.His order froze loadings, even pushed some vessels away that had begun receiving oil, until the review was complete and sale contracts could be modified or ratified, according to internal documents and three people familiar with the matter.As of Jan. 27, a total of 28 vessels including 21 supertankers were waiting near PDVSA's ports to load some 45 million barrels of crude and fuel for exports. Another four ships had loaded but were waiting for authorizations to depart, according to vessel monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.The new terms narrow a wide variety of contract modalities to a few requiring prepayment of cargoes entirely in cash or allowing payment via goods and services to Venezuela, but they must be received before Venezuela will release the oil, according to the documents.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.'SOLVE' ECONOMIC WOESPDVSA explained in a contract viewed by Reuters that cash prepayment puts the company ""in a favorable business position because it would secure income for the country that is essential to solve its economic situation.""The new models set deadlines of less than 30 days for completing bank transfers or settling outstanding debt balances.In cases of swaps where the related oil sale exceeds the value of the goods or services, Venezuela must receive any outstanding balance in kind before the state will assign the next cargo, one of the documents showed.Story continuesEven long-term buyers must abide by the new rules that require payment in full by cash before each oil delivery.So far this month, swap contracts with Cuba's Cubametales and Iran's state firm Naftiran Intertrade Co (NICO) were among the few in force.A contract with Chevron Corp for repaying debt was unaffected. PDVSA has continued to load Chevron-chartered vessels and discharge imports from the U.S. firm.A similar contract to repay debt to China with oil has continued, although the customer has faced more than 30 days of loading delays, according to shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.Since the suspension was imposed in early January, only one of PDVSA's list of new clients and intermediaries, Hangzhou Energy, has been authorized to resume loading following a 12-month contract extension agreed this week, according to the documents and one of the sources.Other contracts are in the final review and should be authorized soon, another source said.UNDER THE RADARBefore U.S. sanctions, PDVSA used to receive letters of credit as guarantees if buyers were cleared to become established customers, and payments were completed in 90 days. Audit mechanisms were suspended about two years ago as the sanctions forced out traditional clients who were replaced by little known intermediaries with no track record of oil sales.Some of those new intermediaries have faced court cases under accusations of corruption and embezzling.Following an increase in the number of oil cargo departures without proper compensation to PDVSA, the company last year demanded to be prepaid at least partially in cash or goods. But the measure had not fully stopped the furtive cargoes.Now, most of the proposed contracts imply a form of swap, so PDVSA pays with oil in return for the government receiving food, medicine or services, including home reconstruction and telecommunications equipment.The suspension has caught even PDVSA employees off-guard.""While contracts remain suspended, we have been told to register all exports in Excel sheets,"" instead of using PDVSA's contract administration system, a company employee said.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Mircely Guanipa in Maracay and Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Venezuela; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Under its “new momentum” scenario, which best reflects the current trajectory, fossil fuels account for 55pc of primary energy in 2050, compared to about 80pc in 2019.“The total consumption of fossil fuels declines in all three scenarios over the outlook,” it says. “This would be the first time in modern history that there has been a sustained fall in the demand for any fossil fuel.”Opec’s share of global oil production is expected to rise sharply after 2030 to almost two-thirds by 2050, albeit in a much smaller market, an important geopolitical shift.The cartel of oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is seen as cutting its output over the next decade to avoid pushing prices down too far.BP is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, producing about more than million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021. The annual energy outlook is a key industry resource.Under chief executive Bernard Looney, it has pledged to shift towards renewable energy and has said it expects to cut its oil and gas output by about 40pc by 2030.Mr Dale says the rise in emissions and frequency of extreme weather events “highlight more clearly than ever the importance of a decisive shift towards a net-zero future”.]"

The Feb. 1 meeting is also expected to end uneventfully, with a decision to likely roll over production targets agreed in December.Ask any OPEC+ delegate what the oil-producing alliance wishes to achieve and you’ll likely hear the word “balance” come up more than once.There are actually three published goals for the 13-member Saudi-led OPEC, or Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which embraced Russia and nine other oil producers in 2015 to form OPEC+.The three are to coordinate and unify the oil policies of the different producing countries to achieve “fair and stable prices”; maintain “efficient, economic and regular supply” to consuming countries; and work toward getting investors in the industry a fair return on capital.But in media interviews, OPEC spokespeople often mash those three ideals into one choice pursuit called “balance”. To them, the market is considered “balanced” when crude is trading at $100 a barrel or more, or at least above $90 (on Friday, U.S. crude settled at under $80 while Brent stalled at below $87). If oil gets to $200 someday, we can presume that it will be even “more balanced” in OPEC’s eyes.This is because, in the six decades of OPEC’s existence, oil producers have been razor-focused on one thing and one thing only: Higher prices. In practice, economic supply for consumers - one of the stated goals of OPEC - isn’t possible because what’s economical to consumers simply isn’t to producers.From OPEC’s viewpoint, consumers want the lowest price that would bankrupt oil companies and freeze investments in future production (those who argue against this should think of the minus $40 a barrel that U.S. crude got to, during the height of the pandemic). On the flip side, oil companies are now declaring record profits. But they’re still not investing in production, citing unfriendly government policies instead.Story continuesSo, here we are, stuck over the definition of what balanced prices for crude should be.With the just-ended week being a disappointing one for oil bulls wishing to put the market into a higher trajectory after a dismal start for the year, hopes will be rising again that OPEC+ can do something in the coming week to “balance” the market.In reality, OPEC+ is struggling to balance the market - not from external pressure but from within.Since early December, the Saudis have been beset with a new headache - the G7 price cap on Russian oil - that has been producing all sorts of undesirable reactions in its closest ally Moscow.The price cap has put a $60 ceiling on each barrel of Russia’s Urals’ oil. That is a discount of at least $27 a barrel to the latest settlement in global benchmark Brent. In the real marketplace, the Russians are selling Urals even cheaper, up to $30 a barrel or more under Brent, especially to Indian buyers, say trade sources.And because they’re getting less money for their oil, the Russians are also shipping out more barrels these days than the Saudis wish them to. And those barrels are primarily going to two destinations - India and China, which are the only two nations the United States allows to buy sanctioned Russian oil without questions. The increased exports from Russia are not only messing up OPEC+’s aim of keeping production tight but also hurting the Saudis as India and China were also the largest markets in Asia for Riyadh’s state oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222).India bought an average of 1.2 million barrels of Russian Urals a day in December, which was 33 times more than a year earlier and 29% more than in November. Discounts for Urals at Russia's western ports for sale to India under some deals widened to $32-$35 per barrel when freight wasn’t included, according to a Reuters report from Dec. 14.The Indians even exported fuel produced from Russian crude to New York via a high-seas transfer at one point, despite U.S. sanctions prohibiting the import of Russian-origin energy products, including refined fuels, distillates, crude oil, coal, and gas.Another Reuters report said China paid the deepest discounts in months for Russian ESPO crude oil in December, amid weak demand and poor refining margins. ESPO is a grade exported from the Russian Far East port of Kozmino and Chinese refiners are dominant clients for this.At least one ESPO cargo for early December arrival was sold to an independent Chinese refiner at a discount of $6 per barrel against the February Brent price on delivery-ex-ship (DES) basis, Reuters said, citing four traders with knowledge of the matter. That discount compared with a premium of about $1.80 fetched by an ESPO barrel in China three weeks prior to the deal. Brent’s plunge to a one-year low of just above $75 by Dec. 9 exacerbated the discount for Russian crude, though the U.K. crude’s rebound to $87 since has narrowed some of that difference.If that wasn’t enough, yet another Reuters report from Friday said Russia’s oil loadings from its Baltic ports were set to rise by 50% in January from December levels. Russia loaded 4.7 million tonnes of Urals and KEBCO from Baltic ports in December. The January surge comes as sellers try to meet strong demand in Asia and benefit from rising global energy prices, said the report, which became the single biggest reason for Friday’s slump in crude prices that basically turned oil into a losing bet for January.The Saudis, on their part, have slashed pricing on their own Arab Light crude to Asia to try and stay competitive amid the ruthless undercutting by the Russians — who are supposed to be their closest ally within OPEC+.Riyadh is also attempting to talk to Moscow, with Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud telling a Bloomberg interview recently that the kingdom was “engaging with Russia over keeping oil prices relatively stable”.“We have a very important partnership with Russia on OPEC+ … that has delivered stability [to] the oil market … we are gonna engage with Russia on that,” Al-Saud said.But on the same day that the Saudi minister spoke, some 1,600 miles away in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak was telling state news agency Tass that Moscow “is not discussing with OPEC+ possibility of its oil production cuts”.Novak was responding to a question on whether the Kremlin will reduce oil output to demand a higher price for its Urals crude as the G7’s $60-per-barrel cap allows buyers to lowball the Russian product versus rival crude benchmarks such as the U.K. Brent, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, the Arab Light and Dubai Light.""No, we are not discussing such issues,"" Novak said.It basically showed the two nations having different ideas on what they need to do at this point: The Russians need to sell as much oil as possible and at whatever price they can. The Saudis want to keep Arab Light competitive against Urals but not flood the market; hence their plan for a rollover in December production targets.The G7 will have two more price caps coming into force on Feb. 5 on refined oil products out of Russia. No one knows what effect those will have on the Kremlin.The powers-that-be in Riyadh are, however, aware that if workarounds aren’t found for these caps, they could be destructive to the fairytale-like harmony within OPEC+ that has masked the organization for what it really is — a bunch of states with contrasting finances and needs pressed into compliance by the Saudis and Russians on the mere promise of price stability.If that stability gets rocked for any reason, those within the alliance could see little reason for not returning to the days of old where each state looked out for itself - something the Russians are already making a marvelous example of.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March did a final trade of $79.38 per barrel, after settling Friday’s trade down $1.33, or 1.6%, at $79.68.For the week, WTI fell 2.5% after a cumulative 11% rally in two previous weeks. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark fell 1%.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery did a final trade of $86.33 after completing Friday’s session down 81 cents, or almost 1%, at $86.66.Brent fell 1.1% on the week after rallying almost 12% over two previous weeks. January-to-date, the global crude benchmark rose less than 1%.Oil: Price OutlookIf WTI does not pop on the theater that OPEC+ pulls at its Feb. 1 meeting, then the U.S. crude benchmark could plummet to its recent low under $76 a barrel, technical chartist Sunil Kumar Dixit said.“In case of a strong break below $79.10 and $78.60, the next drop for WTI would be $77.76 and this may be followed by even lower levels at $76.78 and $75.65,” said Dixit, who is chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.Despite multiple attempts to make a sustainable break above $82.60, Dixit noted that WTI settled the week in a relatively bearish mood at $79.68.“Momentum appears trapped within a $4 range of $82.60-$78.60, which needs to break for further direction,” he added.Dixit said a decisive breakout above $82.60 will open the way for WTI’s next leg higher to $83.88. That could be followed by $84.70. which is a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the drop of $93.76 to $70.06Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $2.856 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday.It settled the day at $2.849 - down 10% from a week ago but virtually unchanged from Thursday’s close.Gas futures have lost 57% of their value over the past six weeks after an unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter led to a collapse in demand for heating oil.Prior to this week’s plunge to $2 levels, gas hit 14-year highs of $10 per mmBtu in August, and even traded as high as $7 in December.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit noted that untiring selloff efforts continued in natural gas for a seventh week in a row, pushing prices down to $2.747 per mmBtu, with hardly any signs of exhaustion yet to the plunge.“The stochastics and RSI on the weekly chart have reached oversold conditions that call for a rebound either from current lows or a bit lower, at $2.60 and $2.35,” Dixit said.On the flip side, oversold conditions call for a short-term rebound towards the resistance zone of $3.00 and $3.30, followed by peaks to the $3.50 and $3.70 supply zone, he added.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold for February delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,928 on Friday after settling the session at $1929.40, down just 60 cents.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, settled at $1,928.15 - down 96 cents, or 1%, on the day. Spot gold peaked at $1,949.29 on Thursday before an intraday high of $1,935.40 on Friday.The $1,950 resistance is a key test for gold’s ability to scale towards record highs of above $2,000 an ounce, which it got to in April last year, almost reprising its all-time peak from August 2020. Since this year began, both futures and spot gold have gained more than 5% each.Gold: Price Outlook Spot gold's failure to settle the week above $1,932, with its drop to below $1,928, raises the possibility of a further descent, said Dixit.“We could revisit gold's recent low of $1,916 and extend the decline towards $1,912, followed by $1,900,” he said.If selling intensifies below $1,900, a further drop to $1,880 and $1,870 can be witnessed, Dixit said.But if spot gold’s bullish trend stays intact, buyers were likely to resurface on the support zone in anticipation of an upshot targeting $1,965 and $1,972, he said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesU.S. lawmakers ask Kerry to urge UAE to replace oil boss as COP28 presidentEU must answer U.S. clean energy subsidies, commissioner says on Washington visit]"

30,c1d472a4-3661-3c7c-9466-cc6ef28f4800,MSFT,2023-01-30,Column: How Big Tech is using mass layoffs to bring workers to heel,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-big-tech-using-mass-130045010.html,1675083645,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'MSFT']","[Union activity at Amazon and other tech companies has been on the rise. Will the sense of precarity engendered by a massive wave of layoffs quash that — or stoke it? (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)In Silicon Valley, the new year began as the last one ended — with tens of thousands of tech workers losing their jobs. Just a few days into 2023, Amazon Chief Executive Andrew Jassy announced that there would be 18,000 layoffs across the company. Within weeks, Microsoft revealed it was slashing its head count by 10,000 and Google said that it was terminating 12,000 employees. IBM looks to be next, with nearly 4,000 workers on the chopping block.This follows 2022’s bloodbath, when tens of thousands of jobs were lost at Meta Platforms, Twitter and Salesforce. According to an industry layoff tracker, the tech sector has eliminated some 220,000 jobs since the start of last year. If the laid-off tech workers formed a city, it’d be one of the most populous in the United States, bigger than Des Moines or Salt Lake City.The question is: Why have many of the most profitable companies of our generation — most of which are still very much profitable — announced staggering rounds of layoffs, one after the other? And why now?A common refrain from analysts and reporters is that the companies are “tightening their belts” after profligate pandemic hiring sprees, in order to streamline operations. The executives overseeing the cuts, for their part, cite adverse economic circumstances. “We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in his layoff announcement. Jassy wrote that “Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so.” Microsoft’s Satya Nadella noted that “some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one.”No recession has yet hit the U.S. or its tech sector. Inflation hurts, but the U.S. economy added hundreds of thousands of jobs last month. Still, certain shareholders have been vocal about their desire to see head counts trimmed — and trimmed further still.To that end, critics argue that simple greed is driving the layoffs; they point to the tens of billions' worth of stock buybacks the tech companies authorized last year. The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto spoke with industry analysts who said that tech companies are evaluating their bottom lines differently, and concluded that they’re doing layoffs mostly because everyone else is, even though layoffs actually often cost a given company money. And the fact all these layoffs are happening in such rapid succession gives the companies some cover — making them seem elemental, inevitable.Story continuesSo what’s really going on here? The answer may actually be pretty simple.“Controlling labor costs via periodic layoffs is like breathing for Silicon Valley: cyclical, necessary for life,” Malcolm Harris, author of the forthcoming book ""Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism and the World,"" told me. The layoffs, Harris says, have “very little to do with long- or even medium-term strategy except as it pertains to cultivating an insecure workforce.""That tracks with the economic reality we do face today, as a tech CEO might put it. Because while a recession has not yet arrived in any meaningful form, there is another economic indicator pointing to the desirability of layoffs, from a large employer’s perspective: a growing effort to organize tech workers in an unusually tight labor market.Tech employees’ salaries have skyrocketed over the last two years, and their bargaining power has begun to grow too. Over the last half-decade, workers in the tech industry have agitated for changes that executives have found increasingly inconvenient.At Google, they’ve spoken up against gender inequalities and pressured the company to drop a lucrative defense contract. At Amazon and Microsoft, they’ve protested lackluster climate policies and spurred those companies to make pledges to reduce carbon emissions. At Facebook and Twitter, workers rallied against content moderation decisions around keeping former President Trump on the platform after Jan. 6, 2021. A subset of Google employees formed the Alphabet Workers Union with the Communication Workers of America union, Amazonians founded the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, and at Microsoft, employees at a video game subsidiary, ZeniMax, formed the first certified union ever to be recognized by the company.The concrete gains won by organizing tech workers so far may be relatively small, but the rising salaries and growing organizing capacity threaten the tech giants’ bottom line and the brand of executive sovereignty that’s prized in Silicon Valley. Elon Musk’s mass firings at Twitter last year, and his public demand that only “hardcore” coders dedicated to his program remain at the company, are instructive here, not least because other tech executives have said his approach was an inspiration when culling jobs at their own companies.Workers in an industry that had long been famously union-agnostic at best had been forming bonds, organizing and developing solidarity. Layoffs of this scale and suddenness can be a blow to that process.Affected tech workers told me that they were struck by the randomness of the firings; senior members of staff in good standing, brilliant colleagues with sterling performance reviews, all shown the door, with little rhyme or reason. Many seemed to wonder why they were spared while their peers weren’t.Alejandra Beatty, a technical program manager at Alphabet subsidiary Verily, told me it was ""very much a surprise"" when she was laid off this month. For one thing, she had known herself to be in good standing at the company. “I was high performance, considered one of the pillars of the local community in the Boulder, Colo., office. Now I’m not even allowed to go back in, not even as a visitor,” she said. Beatty was also struck by how many of those let go were performing functions crucial to keeping ""core products"" working.If there’s one thing that firing people in a large-scale and seemingly random way accomplishes, it’s instilling a sense of precarity, even fear, in those who remain.“It’s completely devastating,” said Skylar Hinnant, a senior quality assurance tester at Microsoft’s ZeniMax subsidiary, “both to the people who are laid off and their families, and their colleagues, who felt, for that day and will feel it a long time after, that they’re at risk.”Hinnant said he knew plenty of people who lost their jobs across Microsoft — everyone does. “You can be the most important engineer at your job, you can be an awesome programmer, at the end of the day if the algorithm wants you gone you’re gone.”“I think it’s waking people up to some realities of what the industry is really like,” Alejandra Beatty said. “We are workers. Even though we have benefits and we are highly trained — we’re still workers. We can still arbitrarily lose our jobs like anyone else.”Beatty had been a visible member of the AWU, advocating in media interviews for reproductive rights in the workplace. She was always civil and constructive, she says, and felt her suggestions had been well-received by management. Now she thinks a lot about whether her termination was retaliatory. Ultimately, she decided the layoffs were too large, too automated to have targeted her directly. “I think I was yet another number in whatever crazy algorithm the consulting company used to figure out the cuts,” she said.Elsewhere, there are signs that tech workers’ hard-won progress is being rolled back. Bloomberg reported that at companies such as Twitter, Meta, Amazon and Redfin that had promised to improve staff diversity, the layoffs decimated departments responsible for diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, inititatives.On Tuesday, workers for Cognizant, a major Alphabet and YouTube contractor, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board that they were being retaliated against for announcing a decision to join the AWU. They say Alphabet changed its policy to make relocation to Austin, Texas, mandatory for all workers, and noncompliance would result in “voluntary termination.” This, the workers say, is against NLRB rules that state that no major policy can be changed once organizing has been made public.The tech industry has certainly shown it will go to unsavory lengths to limit worker pay and power. In 2015, Apple, Google and other tech companies agreed to pay a $415-million settlement after a lawsuit alleged the companies had colluded to keep pay low with a “non-poaching” agreement between CEOs.But today’s massive, department-cleaving cuts do not have to be retaliatory to register a debilitating and destabilizing effect, to help the tech giants consolidate control over their workforces and underline their precarity.“The nice comp and all the perks,” Beatty said, “none of them are really beneficial if you’re always worrying, ‘Well, am I going to be the next to be arbitrarily let go?' ”The clinical cruelty through which some of the layoffs were administered often served to underline that point — Google employees showing up to work to find that their keycards had been deactivated, workers locked out of email accounts and not allowed to enter the offices again, not even to say goodbye to colleagues they had worked with for years.The tech sector seems to be betting that these massive, algorithmically orchestrated firings will not only cut labor costs, but also once again remind increasingly empowered tech workers of their insecurity, and the power the companies still hold. It’s a bet that has historically paid off and has helped transform the tech giants into some of the most profitable companies in history.But there’s also a chance that this time, things could be different.“It’s very galvanizing,” Beatty said. The Alphabet Workers Union held a meeting shortly after the layoffs were announced. “More than 1,000 people joined,” she said, “and another 800 tried to sign up for it after it started. It was big enough that we broke Zoom, and couldn’t do breakout rooms.”Hinnant, the quality assurance tester at ZeniMax, is also an organizer at the newly recognized union at Microsoft. “I think it has lit a fire under a lot of people to think about organizing,” he says. “I have friends at Microsoft and Google and across the industry and I got a lot of calls.”And unlike in tech’s mass layoffs of the past, there is now a foundation of organized workers in place, even if it is a nascent one, with the ability to provide the Salt Lake City-sized population of displaced workers some resources and support.One of the first things that the AWU did, Beatty says, was set up a Slack channel and Discord server where laid-off workers could connect, commiserate and share information and job leads.“It was so incredibly helpful to have a place to go and talk with other people who were impacted,"" Beatty said. ""And then we had people who weren’t laid off joining in to support them, to say goodbye.”Soon, thousands of laid-off workers were joining the channel, not just from Google, but from Meta, and all across the industry. “That was a huge help in understanding the terms, what you can and can’t do, and having that place where people are like, ‘Oh, I’m freaking out,’ and talking it through,"" she said. ""It may become a networking space — we let a couple recruiters in. They all need employment now, you know.”Workers provided informal, ad-hoc counseling services and helped those who could no longer access their email, computers or HR contacts get information and answers. “When you’re struggling with what just happened, it’s good to have people who can help you with that,” Beatty said. “There are people with visas or parental leave, they’re saying, 'How do I navigate this now?' I was compiling some of these questions to pass along, and one guy who was here on a visa said, 'Can you ask them how long until I get deported?' ”Above all, workers like Beatty and Hinnant say it’s spurring interest in further tech worker organizing. “I think this really highlights the need for the people not just in the Microsoft ecosystem, but across the industry to organize,” he says. “I think this was a wake-up call. There’s a wave coming. And there’s no stopping it.”Beatty feels likewise; she’s still hurt by the layoff but hopes to make good use of it. “If I get nothing else out of this,” she says, “I hope to see AWU grow exponentially. Then the sacrifice will have been worth it.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

33,79e4088c-fcbc-3327-b7a5-0a87bbefc9b6,MSFT,2023-01-30,"Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Intel and Microsoft are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-alphabet-apple-intel-microsoft-100010246.html,1675072810,STORY,"['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'INTC', '^GSPC', 'GOOGL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 30, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Intel INTC and Microsoft MSFT.Will This Week's Big Tech Earnings Be a Train Wreck?The market’s initial reaction to the Microsoft report was negative, which made sense given the sluggish top-line growth pace and weak guidance. But sentiment on the numbers shifted as market participants realized that Microsoft’s cloud numbers were hardly the ‘train wreck’ that many had started fearing ahead of the release.Broadly speaking, the market’s favorable reaction to the Microsoft results is in the same spirit with which it has received all incoming results in the Q4 earnings season.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q4 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With results from more than 28% of S&amp;P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q4 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We want to dwell on the Microsoft report a bit more given the read-through that its business provides us for broad trends in enterprise spending.Microsoft’s business in the PC and ‘adjacent’ spaces validated the market’s ‘train wreck’ fears, with the view getting reconfirmed by another disappointing report from Intel. But Microsoft has been far less about PCs and far more about cloud (Azure), and results on that front are good enough.Azure growth of +38%, in constant-currency terms, beat consensus estimates by a hair. Management pointed to a notable deceleration as the quarter unfolded, with the growth pace in December 2022 in the mid-30’s percentage range and they guided towards a bit lower growth pace for the March quarter.Story continuesThese Azure trends are hardly abstract for the market, as they provide the set up for this week’s Amazon and Alphabet results. Microsoft’s Azure is generally seen as the runner up to Amazon Web Services, with Alphabet’s cloud offering as third in place. In addition to Alphabet and Amazon, we also have Apple on the docket reporting results this week.The chart below shows the one-year stock market performance of the Zacks Technology sector (the red line; down -18.8%), Apple (green line; -14.8%), Microsoft (blue line; -19.7%), Alphabet (purple line; -26.1%), Amazon (-29.5) and Meta (-49.9%).The S&amp;P 500 index, which we deliberately kept out of the above chart to reduce clutter in the visual, was down only -9.7% in the period.These businesses aren’t exactly comparable, though digital advertising is core for Alphabet and Meta and to a smaller extent for Amazon. As noted earlier, Amazon is a leader in both the cloud as well as retail spaces, with the latter business facing capacity issues lately. And then there is Apple, which is in a league of its own.Take a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for this group for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.We have highlighted the expected -11.7% earnings decline on +9.2% higher revenues for this group of 5 Tech leaders in 2022 Q2.Revenue growth is expected to remain in positive territory, with cost pressures weighing on earnings expectations. Needless to add that these Tech leaders are faced with compressed margins.Whether the growth trend for these companies is decelerating or not is a function of your holding horizon. These companies are impressive growth engines in the long run, even if those estimates for 2023 and 2024 come down in the days ahead.As the macroeconomic clouds clear, as they eventually will, these digital platforms will be there to recapture those spending dollars.Beyond the big 5 Tech players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -18.5% from the same period last year on -2.6% lower revenues.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, January 27th, we now have Q4 results from 143 S&amp;P 500 members or 28.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 143 index members are down -3.3% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.1% beating revenue estimates.With 108 index members on deck to report Q4 results this week, we will have seen results from one-half of all the index members by the end of the week.The Earnings Big PictureEstimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, as we have been flagging for some time now. The $1.941 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximates to an index ‘EPS’ of $218.56, which compares to $216.89 in 2022.From their peak in mid-April 2022, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have been revised down by -10.8% for the index as a whole and by -12.92% on an ex-Energy basis, with much bigger cuts to estimates for the Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Tech and Aerospace sectors.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digging Into the Early Q4 Earnings Scorecard Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of COVID-19 on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties related to: the agreement with Altria Group, Inc., and the benefits of the transaction; the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions, including the transaction with Swedish Match, may not materialize as expected; Swedish Match’s business experiencing disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, licensees, other business partners or governmental entities; difficulty retaining key Swedish Match employees; the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the transaction with Swedish Match; and the parties being unable to successfully implement integration strategies or to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected time-frames or at all.PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including PMI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations.Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of September 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021, PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

Here are all of this past week's most significant analyst rating changes, covered first on InvestingPro. Sign up for comprehensive, rapid-fire coverage of market-moving analyst moves.Lululemon cut to UnderperformRespected research firm Bernstein downgraded a popular traded name, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), to Underperform and added a $290 PT to the equity.The firm sees expectations for LULU from investors being reset commenting, ""expectations vs. reality gap has been our biggest concern this past year. Now, with no more pent-up demand, a more cautious consumer outlook, and negative margin mix shifts, earnings growth will decelerate materially and we expect the multiple to follow.""Shares of LULU slid 1.5% Tuesday on the downgrade and traded lower throughout the rest of week, closing the week off fractionally at $310.85.Alaska Airlines holds firm against downgradeAs the market got hotter and hotter all week, Wolfe Research came out with a negative note Friday on Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK), downgrading the stock to Peer Perform and cutting the entire U.S. airline sector to Market Underweight.Citing a key airline metric, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), the boutique research outlet commented, ""... ALK is seeing the biggest deceleration in TRASM among the airlines in 1Q and thus is counting on the biggest re-acceleration in TRASM the rest of the year. ALK's competitive capacity trends are also accelerating in 1Q (on a y/y basis).""The downgrade had minimal impact as the U.S. airlines were strong all week, and ALK was no exception: Friday saw only a marginal loss and shares finished the full week up 1.4%.Norfolk Southern slips despite rating bumpDeutsche Bank on Thursday upgraded Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) to Buy with $266 price target due continuation of a prior thesis that was/is ""intrigued with the company’s new operating plan, which combined with a clear sense of urgency from new CEO Alan Shaw had potential to show tangible improvement in the coming months.""Story continuesThe global investment bank noted average train speeds for NSC are up 16% and the railroad company is adding train and engine employees along with efforts to attract new operating talent.Oddly enough, NSC tumbled on the upgrade amid the impending large-scale uncertainty stemming from the central banks as they decide on whether to keep the rate-hike velocity stable or ease off the pedal a bit. NSC shares, which had begun to fall Tuesday, took another sharp drop Thursday and ended the week at $238.81 - down 6.1% from Monday's open near $255.Upgrades for Philip Morris and PTCBulge bracket bank Goldman Sachs came out last week in support of Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) with an upgrade to Buy and a $120 price target.The bank is expecting the tobacco manufacturer to capture investors from three things: ""(1) a broader &amp; more aggressive global rollout of ILUMA; (2) an accelerated RRP innovation pipeline as PM combines technologies from its acquisitions of both Swedish Match and Fertin with its own R&amp;D capabilities to create next generation reduced risk products that push PM into new markets, increase usage occasions and accelerate conversion from combustible cigs; and (3) further price segmentation of iQOS, which is key to penetrating lower-income markets globally and increasing new user acquisitions.""Shares of PM popped on the Wednesday upgrade, closing the session up 2.1% at 103.42 before ending the week at $103.76.And Keybanc on Monday upgraded PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) to overweight with a $155, commenting, ""...we are upgrading PTC to Overweight on our view that the Company could be one of the best FCF growth stories over the next three years.""The analyst sees PTC carrying a free cash flow valuation of 29x, compared to 32x for the group.Shares rose strong in the session and finished the week up 1.8% from Monday's open.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingProRelated ArticlesLululemon stock slashed: The week's 5 biggest analyst callsIndia's Adani hits back at Hindenburg, insists made full disclosureIndia's Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man in eye of a storm]"

They tend to be established, profitable, name-brand companies marked by reliable growth. All of these positive factors contribute to stable share prices that tend to trend upward over time. Buying blue-chip stocks in an emerging bull market is even better. If the economy can avoid recession, then we are likely already in the early innings of a bull market. If we enter a recession, these stocks will still be valid choices because they are likely to rebound above current prices over the long-term. The stocks listed below have generally favorable outlooks paired with dividends, making these stocks wise investments given their dominant market positions and strong fundamentals. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDEODiageo$174.32SONSonoco Products$60.42DDominion Energy$62.49SNYSanofi$48.78EPDEnterprise Products Partners$26.41JDJD.com$62.98PMPhilip Morris$104.06Diageo (DEO) a line up of black label whiskey to represent DEO stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDiageo’s (NYSE:DEO) 2022 annual report provides some compelling evidence in favor of buying the stock. The alcoholic beverages giant increased its net sales, volume, profits, and several other metrics in 2022. Over the course of the year, the firm reported £15.45 million in revenues, a 21.4% increase on a year-over-year basis. These numbers highlight strength in certain segments, particularly with the company’s key brands such as Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray, and Guinness. One advantage Diageo has is that it operates in a total beverage alcohol sector that has grown quickly over the last decade. Diageo is the leader in international spirits, which has grown faster than the total beverage alcohol sector. Diageo anticipates sales growth in the 7-9% range for the next three years. The company will continue to grow its premium-tier spirits, which provide increasingly profitable growth, considering their higher margins. Diageo’s dividend  which yields just under 2% is highly reliable and has increased every year since 2001. Story continuesSonoco Products (SON)A photo of various food packaging containers.Source: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock.comSonoco Products (NYSE:SON) stock isn’t one that many investors talk about often, and may not necessarily be among the top blue-chip stocks on many investors’ minds. That said, the company is a leader in its field and a solid option for investors looking for stability.The South Carolina company provides consumer packaging materials, industrial solutions like boxboard, retail packaging, and point-of-sale displays, among other offerings.Sonoco Products has been in business for more than 120 years and recently received a Gold Medal rating from EcoVadis, a reviewer of supply chain eco-friendliness. That puts Sonoco Products in the top 5% of 100,000 firms reviewed worldwide.Sonoco Products’ financial performance has also been stellar. The firm exceeded the high end of guidance with $1.89 billion in sales in Q3, up 34% yearly. Additionally, operating profit increased 67% to $225 million.Dominion Energy (D)The logo for Dominion Energy (D) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Felix Mizioznikov / Shutterstock.comIt is an opportune time to bet on Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) stock, a utility company providing electricity and natural gas to customers in 15 states.In November, the company initiated a business review to identify ways to increase its flagging share price. Dominion will continue to operate as a state-regulated utility company, but also intends to pivot. The company is investing heavily in decarbonization ,which it expects to produce more robust returns, while maintaining its commitment to its dividend.D stock slid during 2022 from $79 to $61. That kind of performance is more in line with the overall market, which was not expected from this utility company, considering investors expect utility plays to be more defensive in down markets.Ironically, Dominion Energy saw revenues and income rise in Q3 and throughout 2022. However, the company has provided unsatisfactory returns for shareholders over the past few years. An investment in Dominion Energy today is one that could go either way. That said, I like the upside potential with such a bet at these levels.Sanofi (SNY) Sanofi (SNY) logo on the side of company branch in GermanySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comSanofi’s (NASDAQ:SNY) stock is underpinned by excellent recent performance, strong long-term prospects, a dividend, and a robust therapeutics pipeline. It is among the leading global blue-chip pharmaceutical firms, and should continue to perform well over the long-term.Analysts anticipate that Sanofi’s revenues will reach approximately $49 billion in 2023. When the company next releases earnings in February, analysts expect Sanofi will report 2022 revenue slightly below $46 billion. So, Sanofi investors can see that the company has some significant forward-looking growth expected ahead.Sanofi performed very well in Q3, bringing in €12.48 million in revenues, up 19.7% YoY. On a constant currency basis, those revenues increased at a more modest 9% during the same period.Sanofi’s Dupixent accounted for €2.314 million in revenue during Q3, representing a 44.6% increase, even considering exchange rates. Sanofi’s hemophilia drug, efansoctocog alfa, was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA and is the first drug of its type to be given that designation in the treatment of hemophilia A.Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is a somewhat risky pipeline transportation stock with a significant upside.The midstream firm has a roughly 22% upside based on the spread between its target price and current price, at the time of writing. Adding in a dividend yielding 7.6% that hasn’t been reduced since 1998, and its appeal becomes apparent.Let’s assume that the company continues to pay the same 49 cent dividend throughout 2023. That will equate to $1.96 of dividend payments in 2023. Let’s also assume that EPD stock reaches its target price this year. That would bring the total value of a share to $33.47, resulting in a return above 30%.Enterprise Product Partners’ fundamentals improved in Q3 but weren’t exceptional. Its pipeline volumes increased by 6.7 million barrels per day in Q3. Operating income increased from $1.513 billion to $1.712 billion during the same period. Thus, the overarching narrative surrounding EPD stock remains tied to potential returns that depend upon volume and pricing combinations.JD.com (JD) JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese E-Commerce firm JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) should fare well in 2023, as revenues continue to rebound after faltering in the middle of last year.In Q2, JD.com posted 5.4% year-over-year growth based on sales registered in the Chinese Yuan. That was the slowest quarterly growth on record for the company. But in Q3, revenues jumped 11%, as some of the Covid restrictions choking economic activity were eased.China has further lifted Covid restrictions, which should set the stage for resurgent economic activity across the populous nation, leading to rising revenues for JD.com. Analysts tracking the company believe that to be the case. They anticipate JD.com will record $177 billion in sales in 2023, up from an expected $155 billion in 2022.JD stock has a roughly 33% upside based on the difference between its current price and target price. It retains an overwhelming ‘buy’ rating and somewhat surprisingly carries a beta of 0.43, meaning it moves with much lower price volatility than the markets.Philip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comInvestors could be forgiven for thinking Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) stock’s best days were behind. The company has primarily sold cigarettes, which have seen a steady sales decline over the past decade as smoking rates fall.That said, the company is steadily divesting its cigarette holdings in favor of smokeless tobacco products. Philip Morris wants at least 50% of its sales to come from smoke-free products by 2025. It is currently on track to make that goal reality, as other traditional cigarette companies simply haven’t divested and pivoted as quickly.

45,19c8deab-1aef-3438-84d3-c8b7efac2498,HCA,2023-01-30,HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At $0.60,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-healthcare-nyse-hca-pay-101918658.html,1675073958,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare, Inc.'s (NYSE:HCA) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.60 on 31st of March. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 0.9%, which is below the industry average. See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare HCA Healthcare's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, HCA Healthcare's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 13.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 12% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendHCA Healthcare's Dividend Has Lacked ConsistencyIt's comforting to see that HCA Healthcare has been paying a dividend for a number of years now, however it has been cut at least once in that time. This makes us cautious about the consistency of the dividend over a full economic cycle. The annual payment during the last 5 years was $1.40 in 2018, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.40. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. HCA Healthcare has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. HCA Healthcare has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 27% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Story continuesHCA Healthcare Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, HCA Healthcare has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit concerning) we think you should know about. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

52,2b383c89-54e7-361e-98dd-24d60c1a248f,AIG,2023-01-30,American International Group (NYSE:AIG) shareholders have earned a 11% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-group-nyse-aig-110200968.html,1675076520,STORY,['AIG'],"[Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) share price is up 24% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 9.7%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for American International Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.American International Group was able to grow its EPS at 109% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.43 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American International Group has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling American International Group stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, American International Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 35%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that American International Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 12% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with American International Group (including 1 which can't be ignored) .Of course American International Group may not be the best stock to buy.

One critical component of investing is to secure stable cash flows. This is likely through fixed income, rental income, or investment in dividend stocks. With the markets continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds, it’s a good time to look at some dividend stocks to buy for the coming years.I would allocate 50% of my funds toward dividend stocks, though your allocation may vary based on your individual risk profile. I must also mention that dividend stocks do not only imply dividend gains. Based on certain growth catalysts, dividend stocks also offer meaningful capital gains.I believe that these stocks are attractively valued. In the next five years, total returns (dividend and capital gains) from these stocks will exceed index returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these dividend stocks to buy.NEMNewmont Mining$54.13AZNAstraZeneca$65.99LMTLockheed Martin$459.81CVXChevron Corporation$187.79VALEVale$19.30TAT&amp;T$20.00WMTWalmart$142.21Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockSentiments have turned bullish for gold with inflation easing and with the possibility of a recession in 2023. Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) is among the top dividend stocks to buy as the company stands to benefit from higher realized gold prices.Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet and that’s a key reason to like the blue-chip stock. The company is positioned to deliver robust cash flows and I expect dividend growth. Currently, NEM stock offers a yield of 4.1%.Newmont reported an operating cash flow of $2.2 billion for the first nine months of 2022. This was on the lower realized gold price. For the current year, OCF is likely to be in excess of $4 billion.Newmont, with 96 million ounces of proved reserves, is also attractive from a long-term perspective. The asset base provides clear free cash flow visibility even if gold remains sideways.Story continuesAstraZeneca (AZN)Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at SnackvikenSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.comAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is another attractive dividend stock to buy and hold. AZN stock offers a dividend yield of 1.4% and there is clear visibility for dividend growth in the coming years. In the last 12 months, AZN stock has also trended higher by 14.5%.For the first nine months of 2022, AstraZeneca reported revenue growth of 37%. With a strong pipeline of drug candidates, the company expects to sustain low double-digit revenue growth. Currently, AstraZeneca has 179 projects in pipeline.Another point to note is that the company has a diverse therapy area focus. This includes oncology, bio-pharmaceutical and rare diseases. With a wide addressable market and global presence, the growth outlook is positive.In the last 12 months, AstraZeneca has reported operating cash flow of $7.4 billion. OCF is likely to accelerate with revenue growth. This positions the company for aggressive investment in research and development. Additionally, there is ample headroom for dividend growth.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAt a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.4, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an attractive dividend stock to buy. LMT stock offers a current dividend yield of 2.67% and I see visibility for dividend growth.Global defense spending is likely to remain high and Lockheed is positioned to benefit. The company has already been witnessing robust order intake. As of Q4 2022, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $150 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog increased by 11%.There are two important reasons to believe that the order backlog will continue to remain robust. First and foremost, Lockheed has been winning orders from outside the United States. As Europe increases defense spending to meet the NATO target, Lockheed will benefit.Furthermore, Lockheed has been investing in innovation. This includes investment in hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy. With these initiatives, the company expects to resume revenue growth in 2024. The dividend growth outlook is therefore bright.Chevron Corporation (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is possibly the best pick. The 3.14% dividend yield stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 9.4.Even with recession concerns, oil has remained firm around $80 per barrel. This will ensure robust cash flows for Chevron, which has attractive break-even assets. Just to put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. The annualized OCF potential is $40 billion.Chevron plans to invest $15 to $17 billion annually in the next few years. Even with aggressive investments, there will be ample funds for dividends and buybacks. It’s worth mentioning that Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet.With high financial flexibility, reserve replacement is likely to remain robust. This will ensure steady long-term cash flow visibility.Vale (VALE)the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comVale (NYSE:VALE) stock has been surging higher with returns of 40% in the last six months.The stock remains attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.4. Additionally, the dividend yield is attractive at 7.9% and I expect dividends to sustain.With fears of recession, there is a high possibility of stimulus measures in the coming quarters. This will be positive for commodity prices. Iron ore has already been trending higher and this explains the rally in VALE stock.For Q3 2022, Vale reported an adjusted EBITDA of $4 billion. Therefore, even with relatively soft commodity prices, the EBITDA outlook is robust. For the current year, I expect an annualized EBITDA in excess of $20 billion. Cash flows are therefore likely to remain healthy.The iron ore segment remains the cash cow for Vale. However, the company has also been investing in copper and nickel projects. The objective is to benefit from the impending demand for these metals in a low carbon economy.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo on wooden backgroundSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comConsidering the valuations, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is another name among dividend stocks to buy and hold. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4, T stock looks poised for a meaningful rally. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 5.79%.Recently, AT&amp;T reported strong quarterly numbers and there are several positives. First, the company reduced net debt by $24 billion last year. Deleveraging is likely to continue and as credit metrics improve, the stock will trend higher.Further, for 2022, AT&amp;T reported $14.1 billion in free cash flow. For the same period, the company paid $8 billion in dividend. Financial flexibility is therefore high for investments to sustain growth.For five consecutive quarters, AT&amp;T has reported growth in phone and fiber subscribers. This is an encouraging metric and as 5G penetration increases, I expect subscriber growth to remain healthy. The company’s mid-band 5G spectrum already covers more than 150 million people.AT&amp;T is a focused organization after the spin-off of the media division. Key metrics point to positive business development, which will translate into shareholder value creation.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is among the dividend stocks to buy and hold for the long term. The stock currently offers a dividend yield of 1.57%.Even with the challenges related to inflation, Walmart has reported good numbers. The company returned $13.3 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2022.I expect comparable store sales growth to be better in 2023 as compared to last year. Any recession would be good news for Walmart as it would imply immediate action from policymakers to spur spending.In the international markets, Walmart reported revenue growth of 7.1% for Q3 2023. In the coming years, international market growth is likely to remain robust.

Exxon estimates 10% or more of return for the business.Exxon has budgeted $7 billion for hydrogen, carbon capture and biofuels projects between 2022 and 2027. A final investment decision for the hydrogen project is expected by 2024.""People will see that this works and that it can be economically viable,"" Ammann said.Exxon said its Baytown facility in Texas is expected to produce 1 billion cubic feet of blue hydrogen per day. The fuel, which produces no emissions when burnt, is targeted at heavy industries trying to switch from fossil to renewable fuels.Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas in combination with carbon capture. Exxon plans to permanently bury underground 98% of the associated CO2 produced, or about 7 million metric tons annually.Last year, Exxon struck its first commercial carbon storage deal with the world's top ammonia maker CF Industries under an effort to target a projected $4 trillion CCS market by 2050. Ammonia in its liquid form can be used to transport hydrogen to different parts of the world, as a hydrogen carrier.""You are starting to see the foundation of our Low Carbon solutions business taking shape,"" Ammann said.

It reinforces measures implemented last year after several buyers skipped out on payments for oil, which provides most of the South American country's income.After taking the helm, Tellechea launched an extensive audit of supply contracts, according to a written order to PDVSA seen by Reuters.His order froze loadings, even pushed some vessels away that had begun receiving oil, until the review was complete and sale contracts could be modified or ratified, according to internal documents and three people familiar with the matter.As of Jan. 27, a total of 28 vessels including 21 supertankers were waiting near PDVSA's ports to load some 45 million barrels of crude and fuel for exports. Another four ships had loaded but were waiting for authorizations to depart, according to vessel monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.The new terms narrow a wide variety of contract modalities to a few requiring prepayment of cargoes entirely in cash or allowing payment via goods and services to Venezuela, but they must be received before Venezuela will release the oil, according to the documents.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.'SOLVE' ECONOMIC WOESPDVSA explained in a contract viewed by Reuters that cash prepayment puts the company ""in a favorable business position because it would secure income for the country that is essential to solve its economic situation.""The new models set deadlines of less than 30 days for completing bank transfers or settling outstanding debt balances.In cases of swaps where the related oil sale exceeds the value of the goods or services, Venezuela must receive any outstanding balance in kind before the state will assign the next cargo, one of the documents showed.Story continuesEven long-term buyers must abide by the new rules that require payment in full by cash before each oil delivery.So far this month, swap contracts with Cuba's Cubametales and Iran's state firm Naftiran Intertrade Co (NICO) were among the few in force.A contract with Chevron Corp for repaying debt was unaffected. PDVSA has continued to load Chevron-chartered vessels and discharge imports from the U.S. firm.A similar contract to repay debt to China with oil has continued, although the customer has faced more than 30 days of loading delays, according to shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.Since the suspension was imposed in early January, only one of PDVSA's list of new clients and intermediaries, Hangzhou Energy, has been authorized to resume loading following a 12-month contract extension agreed this week, according to the documents and one of the sources.Other contracts are in the final review and should be authorized soon, another source said.UNDER THE RADARBefore U.S. sanctions, PDVSA used to receive letters of credit as guarantees if buyers were cleared to become established customers, and payments were completed in 90 days. Audit mechanisms were suspended about two years ago as the sanctions forced out traditional clients who were replaced by little known intermediaries with no track record of oil sales.Some of those new intermediaries have faced court cases under accusations of corruption and embezzling.Following an increase in the number of oil cargo departures without proper compensation to PDVSA, the company last year demanded to be prepaid at least partially in cash or goods. But the measure had not fully stopped the furtive cargoes.Now, most of the proposed contracts imply a form of swap, so PDVSA pays with oil in return for the government receiving food, medicine or services, including home reconstruction and telecommunications equipment.The suspension has caught even PDVSA employees off-guard.""While contracts remain suspended, we have been told to register all exports in Excel sheets,"" instead of using PDVSA's contract administration system, a company employee said.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Mircely Guanipa in Maracay and Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Venezuela; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

This is because if the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last in the long run.So, what’s earnings growth? Study a company’s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings play a noteworthy role.Earnings Estimates &amp; Share Price MovementsFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Thus, investors should be on the lookout for stocks ready to make a big move. Hence, investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Measures:To shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).Story continues% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 20. Here are the top four stocks that stand out:Deckers Outdoor DECK is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports, and other lifestyle-related activities.

67,4b3285d9-eb33-3b6d-b6a5-ec9e3139646b,NEE,2023-01-30,7 Renewable Energy Stocks That Will Be Big Winners in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-renewable-energy-stocks-big-214736469.html,1674769656,STORY,"['BEP', 'NEE-PR', 'ENPH', 'CWEN-A', 'ORA', 'WAVE']","[Renewable energy stocks represent a necessary mechanism to address environmental viability. According to NASA, the “…potential future effects of global climate change include more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought in some regions, and an increase in the duration and intensity of tropical storms.” Still, this sector doesn’t concentrate exclusively on the science of climate change.Rather, renewable energy stocks legitimately offer potential upside rewards for prospective stakeholders. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, by 2026, “…global renewable-electricity capacity will rise more than 80 percent from 2020 levels (to more than 5,022 gigawatts).” Further, Allied Market Research states that the global renewables market will command a valuation of nearly $1.98 trillion by 2030. That’s a massive economy in and of itself. About the only thing you need to do is to get in early before the given wave. Below are seven renewable energy stocks to consider.NEENextEra Energy$76.40ENPHEnphase Energy$208.02BEPBrookfield Renewable$29.29CWENClearway Energy$33.51STEMStem$9.57ORAOrmat Technologies$91.60WAVEEco Wave Power$3.84InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockA mainstay among renewable energy stocks, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) offers an excellent starting point for investors seeking to go green. Fundamentally, NextEra represents one of the U.S.’s largest capital investors in renewable infrastructures. Per its website, the company commands 45,500 megawatts of net generating capacity.Currently, NextEra enjoys strong support from Wall Street, with covering analysts pegging shares as a consensus strong buy. Indeed, it’s a rarity in that the company enjoys a unanimous strong buy view. Further, the experts’ average price target stands at $97.13, implying an upside potential of nearly 27% from the time-of-writing price.Recent data suggests the enthusiasm toward NEE is more than justified. In late October last year, Reuters mentioned that NextEra crushed revenue estimates due to the demand for clean energy surging. For those sitting on the fence, the company also offers a forward dividend yield of 2.2%. Combined with the experts’ upside potential, NEE ranks among the renewable energy stocks to buy.Story continuesEnphase Energy (ENPH)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockBilled as an energy technology firm, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) develops and manufactures solar micro-inverters, battery energy storage, and electric vehicle charging stations primarily for residential customers. Fundamentally, the battery storage system will likely appeal to consumers who live in regions hard hit by blackouts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, ENPH gained nearly 73% in the trailing year.Still, contrarian investors may want to target ENPH on their wish list of renewable energy stocks. For one thing, recent jitters sent Enphase shares down 17%, likely on profit taking. Second, despite the latest splash of red ink, ENPH still garners the support of Wall Street. Presently, experts peg the company as a consensus strong buy. Also, their average price target implies an upside potential of nearly 55%.According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value, ENPH rates as significantly undervalued. Objectively, the underlying company features excellent sales growth and solid profit margins, making it an enticing candidate for renewable energy stocks.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA publicly traded limited partnership, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) owns and operates renewable power assets. These assets consist of hydroelectric plants, wind farms, solar facilities, and also energy storage facilities. Unlike some other renewable energy stocks, BEP underperformed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index in the trailing year, slipping nearly 10%.Nevertheless, in the year so far, Brookfield appears poised to redeem itself, with shares gaining almost 13% of equity value. Significantly, among six covering analysts, BEP rates as a consensus strong buy. The only holdout is a hold rating. Moreover, their average price target for Brookfield shares stands at $34.55, implying 18% upside potential. According to Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for FMV, Brookfield rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, BEP features a discount based on its price-to-operating cash-flow ratio of 6.1 times (below 61% of the competition).At the moment, Brookfield offers a forward yield of 4.37%. However, do note that ownership of BEP requires filing Schedule K-1 forms.Clearway Energy (CWEN)A shot of wind energy mills with green hills and the skyline in the background.Source: ShutterstockBased in New Jersey, Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,500 net megawatts (MW) of installed wind and solar generation projects, per its website. Further, the company’s over 8,000 net MW of assets also include approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas generation facilities.To be fair, CWEN got off to a relatively slow start compared to other renewable energy stocks. In the trailing year, it sits a hair below parity. On a year-to-date basis, CWEN gained a modest 3.5%. Still, analysts appreciate the underlying enterprise, rating it a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target of $37.50 implies a potential upside of over 13%.Further, Clearway will likely attract investors seeking discounted renewable energy stocks. Currently, the market prices CWEN at a trailing multiple of 6.9. In contrast, the sector median stands at 19 times. As a nice bonus, Clearway carries a forward yield of 4.43%, above the utilities sector’s average yield of 3.75%.Stem (STEM)blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines PGY stock.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaBilled as a global leader in artificial intelligence-driven clean energy solutions and services provider, Stem (NYSE:STEM) deserves consideration among contrarians. Through its AI protocol, Stem enables simplified and efficient energy management, facilitating resilience for energy networks. As well, it provides energy storage systems, delivering power when needed most.To be fair, Stem ranks among the choppier names for renewable energy stocks. This isn’t surprising given that STEM entered the public ecosystem via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Long story short, SPACs don’t carry a positive reputation. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts assigned STEM a consensus (and unanimous) strong buy view. Moreover, their average price target stands at $16.25, implying nearly 66% upside potential.Still, prospective investors should be aware that Stem features an aspirational narrative. At best, Stem has a middling balance sheet. As well, it’s consistently unprofitable. However, its strong revenue growth could make it an interesting pickup among speculative renewable energy stocks.Ormat Technologies (ORA)A geothermal power plant operates, with a large lake visible in the foreground and mountainous terrain visible in the background.Source: Kirill Chernyshev / Shutterstock.comWhile a risky idea, Ormat Technologies (NYSE:ORA) represents a compelling idea among renewable energy stocks. Specifically, Ormat specializes in geothermal energy. According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, “[g]eothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human-made at varying temperatures and depths below the Earth’s surface.”Further, to clarify any misconceptions, geothermal energy represents a genuinely renewable resource. Basically, the heat from the Earth’s interior continuously replenishes. As well, facilities leveraging this energy source “produce electricity consistently and can run essentially 24 hours per day/7 days per week, regardless of weather conditions.”In terms of analyst support, prospective investors must exercise intrepidness. Presently, market experts rate Ormat as a consensus hold – three holds and nothing else. Nevertheless, investors may take encouragement at the gradual sales growth following the coronavirus pandemic. Thus, it’s worth checking out for anyone wanting to gamble on renewable energy stocks.Eco Wave Power (WAVE)A photograph of the ocean.Source: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.comEasily the riskiest name on this list of renewable energy stocks, the Sweden-based Eco Wave Power (NASDAQ:WAVE) represents a wave energy specialist. Fundamentally, these enterprises attempt to leverage the kinetic energy inherent in the natural movement of bodies of water. Moreover, such technologies offer a palatable way to do renewables. In other words, the physical infrastructures are largely out of sight, out of mind.Specifically, Eco Wave developed an innovative technology that facilitates a grid-connected wave energy array operation. As well, what distinguishes Eco Wave from other wave energy competitors is that the former integrates infrastructure either near shore or onshore. Part of the decision-making process here centers on lower costs and greater reliability. Still, in many ways, wave energy remains a pioneering technology. For instance, high costs dragged down similar endeavors. And let’s face it, WAVE isn’t exactly killing it, losing over 32% in the trailing year. But if you want to take a potshot with renewable energy stocks, this might be it.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

68,6d352f02-1d05-3600-8591-3ee8ee9e75b1,NEE,2023-01-30,7 Utility Stocks That Will Be Big Winners in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-utility-stocks-big-winners-143025519.html,1674743425,STORY,"['SRE', 'EIX', 'OGE', 'NEE-PR', 'YORW', 'D', 'DUK']","[When faced with economic uncertainty, investors should turn their attention to utility stocks to buy. Hardly an exciting arena, these critical service providers literally keep societies running. Cynically, this sector benefits from a simple harsh reality: bad things erupt when people flip the switch and nothing happens.Further, utility stocks thrive on insulation from the trade-down effect. When consumers face financial woes, they don’t always cut their spending cold turkey. Rather, they trade down their purchases until they reach an agreeable equilibrium between quality and pricing. However, no alternatives (save for going off the grid) exists for public utilities: you’re either getting your services or you’re not.Ultimately, then, this sector provides an attribute that so many seek today – predictability. With that, below are the utility stocks that will be big winners in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSRESempra Energy$158.98DUKDuke Energy$101.42DDominion Energy$62.32OGEOGE Energy$39.03YORWYork Water$45.76EIXEdison International$67.53NEENextEra Energy$76.59Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs one of the largest energy networks in North America, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) commands extraordinary relevance among utility stocks. For starters, you can look at the company’s consumer base of more than 40 million people. More importantly, Sempra owns a considerable geographic advantage. Covering Southern California, you really can’t operate in a more desirable part of the country.Combining an international borderline with a warm-sea port, the lower half of the Golden State is a veritable gold mine. And because of that, consumers – no matter how much they complain about Sempra – will find a way to pay up. It’s either that or move to Idaho (something that Idahoans would prefer Californians not do).Better yet, analysts for the most part appreciate SRE as one of the utility stocks to buy. Currently, Wall Street experts rate Sempra a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target implies a potential upside of 8%. When combined with the company’s forward yield of 2.89%, SRE makes for an enticing idea.Story continuesDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) represents a powerhouse name among utility stocks, in this case covering much of the east coast. According to its website, Duke’s electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.Similar to Sempra Energy above, Duke also enjoys a geographic advantage, particularly in terms of millennial migration patterns. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, young people from pricey metropolitan areas looked to more rural regions for lower costs of living. However, the Covid-19 crisis accelerated these financial concerns, thereby speeding up migration among younger age cohorts. With regions like the Carolinas attractive to millennials, Duke is positioned where the money will be.Currently, covering analysts rate DUK as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $107.64, implying almost 7% upside potential. Notably, Duke carries a forward yield of 3.98%, making it one of the more attractive utility stocks to buy.Dominion Energy (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is a power and energy firm supplying electricity in parts of its home state and the Carolinas. As well, it supplies natural gas to parts of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Per its website, Dominion serves nearly 7 million customers.To be fair, D stock hasn’t exactly been a great performance, especially compared to other utility stocks. For instance, in the trailing year, Dominion shares gave up nearly 20% of equity value. That said, the fundamentals of millennial migration patterns bode well for the company. As an example, millennials have flocked to Georgia, in particular Atlanta. Many of the other states that Dominion covers also attract young workers and families.Admittedly, Wall Street analysts rate Dominion as a consensus hold. However, their average price target implies an upside potential of 10%. Combine this with the company’s forward yield of 4.24% and you have a solid case for utility stocks to buy.OGE Energy (OGE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, OGE Energy (NYSE:OGE) is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for electricity in its home state and western Arkansas. Presently, OGE commands a market capitalization of $7.68 billion.While not the most exciting idea in the capital market, OGE more than holds its own against other utility stocks. In the trailing year, shares gained over 3%. To be sure, shares traded in a choppy manner throughout much of 2022. And while analysts aren’t exactly in love with the company – rating it a consensus hold – their average price target implies a potential upside of 6%.True, it’s not a blistering target. However, the company carries a forward yield of 4.32%. In addition, it enjoys 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will surely not want to give up on. Finally, on a fundamental level, OGE is undervalued, trading at a trailing multiple of 8.25 (below the sector median of 16.6). Thus, it’s worthy of consideration for utility stocks to buy.York Water (YORW)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comTaking a dive into the smaller side of utility stocks, the Pennsylvania-based York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) is an investor-owned public utility that provides water and wastewater management solutions. It serves an estimated population of 190,000 through approximately 66,000 service connections across 48 municipalities. While definitely not the most invigorating example within the utility sector, for slow-and-steady reliability, it’s hard to beat.As well, York Water offers a small piece of American history. Per its public profile, the company carries the distinction of being the oldest investor-owned utility in the nation. It also has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816. That’s quite a record, needless to say.Back to the present day, York could use some shoring up of its balance sheet. However, it also features excellent profitability metrics. For example, the company’s net margin of 31.64% ranks above 94% of the competition.Now, with a forward yield of 1.79%, York isn’t the most generous among utility stocks. Still, if you’re seeking a steady anchor, YORW deserves further investigation.Edison International (EIX)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comBased in Rosemead, California, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) represents a public utility holding firm. Among its divisions stands Southern California Edison, which is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., serving about 15 million people. Thanks to providing for the economic powerhouse of the nation, EIX performed well, gaining nearly 8% in the trailing year.Moving forward, Edison offers an attractive profile for investors seeking dependable utility stocks. First, Wall Street experts maintain generally positive views of EIX, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. Admittedly, their average price target of $70.71 (implying a 5.5% upside) isn’t that hot. However, the company makes up for this with a forward yield of 4.4%.Significantly, this ranks above the average 3.75% average yield of utility stocks. As well, Edison features 19 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will surely want to keep going.As an added bonus, EIX also pings as objectively undervalued. Currently, the market prices shares at 14 times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16.6 times.NextEra Energy (NEE)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, most of the electricity produced in this country stems from natural gas, nuclear energy, and coal. Barring dramatic innovations, this narrative might not change in our lifetimes. Still, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) would like to move the needle to the renewable spectrum of the energy value chain.As one of the biggest capital investors of clean and renewable energy infrastructures, NEE easily ranks among the most relevant utility stocks to buy. Better yet, Wall Street analysts unreservedly support NextEra. Not only do they rate shares a consensus strong buy, but it’s also unanimous among nine experts. As well, their average price target stands at $97.33, implying nearly 18% upside potential.To be fair, NextEra doesn’t offer the greatest forward yield among utility stocks at 2.06%. However, with a payout ratio of 50.19%, it’s likely a reliable form of passive income. Plus, the company is on a 29-year streak of consecutive dividend increases. Again, management won’t give that up without a fight.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Exxon estimates 10% or more of return for the business.Exxon has budgeted $7 billion for hydrogen, carbon capture and biofuels projects between 2022 and 2027. A final investment decision for the hydrogen project is expected by 2024.""People will see that this works and that it can be economically viable,"" Ammann said.Exxon said its Baytown facility in Texas is expected to produce 1 billion cubic feet of blue hydrogen per day. The fuel, which produces no emissions when burnt, is targeted at heavy industries trying to switch from fossil to renewable fuels.Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas in combination with carbon capture. Exxon plans to permanently bury underground 98% of the associated CO2 produced, or about 7 million metric tons annually.Last year, Exxon struck its first commercial carbon storage deal with the world's top ammonia maker CF Industries under an effort to target a projected $4 trillion CCS market by 2050. Ammonia in its liquid form can be used to transport hydrogen to different parts of the world, as a hydrogen carrier.""You are starting to see the foundation of our Low Carbon solutions business taking shape,"" Ammann said.

It reinforces measures implemented last year after several buyers skipped out on payments for oil, which provides most of the South American country's income.After taking the helm, Tellechea launched an extensive audit of supply contracts, according to a written order to PDVSA seen by Reuters.His order froze loadings, even pushed some vessels away that had begun receiving oil, until the review was complete and sale contracts could be modified or ratified, according to internal documents and three people familiar with the matter.As of Jan. 27, a total of 28 vessels including 21 supertankers were waiting near PDVSA's ports to load some 45 million barrels of crude and fuel for exports. Another four ships had loaded but were waiting for authorizations to depart, according to vessel monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.The new terms narrow a wide variety of contract modalities to a few requiring prepayment of cargoes entirely in cash or allowing payment via goods and services to Venezuela, but they must be received before Venezuela will release the oil, according to the documents.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.'SOLVE' ECONOMIC WOESPDVSA explained in a contract viewed by Reuters that cash prepayment puts the company ""in a favorable business position because it would secure income for the country that is essential to solve its economic situation.""The new models set deadlines of less than 30 days for completing bank transfers or settling outstanding debt balances.In cases of swaps where the related oil sale exceeds the value of the goods or services, Venezuela must receive any outstanding balance in kind before the state will assign the next cargo, one of the documents showed.Story continuesEven long-term buyers must abide by the new rules that require payment in full by cash before each oil delivery.So far this month, swap contracts with Cuba's Cubametales and Iran's state firm Naftiran Intertrade Co (NICO) were among the few in force.A contract with Chevron Corp for repaying debt was unaffected. PDVSA has continued to load Chevron-chartered vessels and discharge imports from the U.S. firm.A similar contract to repay debt to China with oil has continued, although the customer has faced more than 30 days of loading delays, according to shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.Since the suspension was imposed in early January, only one of PDVSA's list of new clients and intermediaries, Hangzhou Energy, has been authorized to resume loading following a 12-month contract extension agreed this week, according to the documents and one of the sources.Other contracts are in the final review and should be authorized soon, another source said.UNDER THE RADARBefore U.S. sanctions, PDVSA used to receive letters of credit as guarantees if buyers were cleared to become established customers, and payments were completed in 90 days. Audit mechanisms were suspended about two years ago as the sanctions forced out traditional clients who were replaced by little known intermediaries with no track record of oil sales.Some of those new intermediaries have faced court cases under accusations of corruption and embezzling.Following an increase in the number of oil cargo departures without proper compensation to PDVSA, the company last year demanded to be prepaid at least partially in cash or goods. But the measure had not fully stopped the furtive cargoes.Now, most of the proposed contracts imply a form of swap, so PDVSA pays with oil in return for the government receiving food, medicine or services, including home reconstruction and telecommunications equipment.The suspension has caught even PDVSA employees off-guard.""While contracts remain suspended, we have been told to register all exports in Excel sheets,"" instead of using PDVSA's contract administration system, a company employee said.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Mircely Guanipa in Maracay and Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Venezuela; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

One critical component of investing is to secure stable cash flows. This is likely through fixed income, rental income, or investment in dividend stocks. With the markets continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds, it’s a good time to look at some dividend stocks to buy for the coming years.I would allocate 50% of my funds toward dividend stocks, though your allocation may vary based on your individual risk profile. I must also mention that dividend stocks do not only imply dividend gains. Based on certain growth catalysts, dividend stocks also offer meaningful capital gains.I believe that these stocks are attractively valued. In the next five years, total returns (dividend and capital gains) from these stocks will exceed index returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these dividend stocks to buy.NEMNewmont Mining$54.13AZNAstraZeneca$65.99LMTLockheed Martin$459.81CVXChevron Corporation$187.79VALEVale$19.30TAT&amp;T$20.00WMTWalmart$142.21Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockSentiments have turned bullish for gold with inflation easing and with the possibility of a recession in 2023. Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) is among the top dividend stocks to buy as the company stands to benefit from higher realized gold prices.Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet and that’s a key reason to like the blue-chip stock. The company is positioned to deliver robust cash flows and I expect dividend growth. Currently, NEM stock offers a yield of 4.1%.Newmont reported an operating cash flow of $2.2 billion for the first nine months of 2022. This was on the lower realized gold price. For the current year, OCF is likely to be in excess of $4 billion.Newmont, with 96 million ounces of proved reserves, is also attractive from a long-term perspective. The asset base provides clear free cash flow visibility even if gold remains sideways.Story continuesAstraZeneca (AZN)Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at SnackvikenSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.comAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is another attractive dividend stock to buy and hold. AZN stock offers a dividend yield of 1.4% and there is clear visibility for dividend growth in the coming years. In the last 12 months, AZN stock has also trended higher by 14.5%.For the first nine months of 2022, AstraZeneca reported revenue growth of 37%. With a strong pipeline of drug candidates, the company expects to sustain low double-digit revenue growth. Currently, AstraZeneca has 179 projects in pipeline.Another point to note is that the company has a diverse therapy area focus. This includes oncology, bio-pharmaceutical and rare diseases. With a wide addressable market and global presence, the growth outlook is positive.In the last 12 months, AstraZeneca has reported operating cash flow of $7.4 billion. OCF is likely to accelerate with revenue growth. This positions the company for aggressive investment in research and development. Additionally, there is ample headroom for dividend growth.Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAt a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.4, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an attractive dividend stock to buy. LMT stock offers a current dividend yield of 2.67% and I see visibility for dividend growth.Global defense spending is likely to remain high and Lockheed is positioned to benefit. The company has already been witnessing robust order intake. As of Q4 2022, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $150 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog increased by 11%.There are two important reasons to believe that the order backlog will continue to remain robust. First and foremost, Lockheed has been winning orders from outside the United States. As Europe increases defense spending to meet the NATO target, Lockheed will benefit.Furthermore, Lockheed has been investing in innovation. This includes investment in hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy. With these initiatives, the company expects to resume revenue growth in 2024. The dividend growth outlook is therefore bright.Chevron Corporation (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is possibly the best pick. The 3.14% dividend yield stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 9.4.Even with recession concerns, oil has remained firm around $80 per barrel. This will ensure robust cash flows for Chevron, which has attractive break-even assets. Just to put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. The annualized OCF potential is $40 billion.Chevron plans to invest $15 to $17 billion annually in the next few years. Even with aggressive investments, there will be ample funds for dividends and buybacks. It’s worth mentioning that Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet.With high financial flexibility, reserve replacement is likely to remain robust. This will ensure steady long-term cash flow visibility.Vale (VALE)the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comVale (NYSE:VALE) stock has been surging higher with returns of 40% in the last six months.The stock remains attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.4. Additionally, the dividend yield is attractive at 7.9% and I expect dividends to sustain.With fears of recession, there is a high possibility of stimulus measures in the coming quarters. This will be positive for commodity prices. Iron ore has already been trending higher and this explains the rally in VALE stock.For Q3 2022, Vale reported an adjusted EBITDA of $4 billion. Therefore, even with relatively soft commodity prices, the EBITDA outlook is robust. For the current year, I expect an annualized EBITDA in excess of $20 billion. Cash flows are therefore likely to remain healthy.The iron ore segment remains the cash cow for Vale. However, the company has also been investing in copper and nickel projects. The objective is to benefit from the impending demand for these metals in a low carbon economy.AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo on wooden backgroundSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comConsidering the valuations, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is another name among dividend stocks to buy and hold. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4, T stock looks poised for a meaningful rally. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 5.79%.Recently, AT&amp;T reported strong quarterly numbers and there are several positives. First, the company reduced net debt by $24 billion last year. Deleveraging is likely to continue and as credit metrics improve, the stock will trend higher.Further, for 2022, AT&amp;T reported $14.1 billion in free cash flow. For the same period, the company paid $8 billion in dividend. Financial flexibility is therefore high for investments to sustain growth.For five consecutive quarters, AT&amp;T has reported growth in phone and fiber subscribers. This is an encouraging metric and as 5G penetration increases, I expect subscriber growth to remain healthy. The company’s mid-band 5G spectrum already covers more than 150 million people.AT&amp;T is a focused organization after the spin-off of the media division. Key metrics point to positive business development, which will translate into shareholder value creation.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is among the dividend stocks to buy and hold for the long term. The stock currently offers a dividend yield of 1.57%.Even with the challenges related to inflation, Walmart has reported good numbers. The company returned $13.3 billion to shareholders in the first nine months of 2022.I expect comparable store sales growth to be better in 2023 as compared to last year. Any recession would be good news for Walmart as it would imply immediate action from policymakers to spur spending.In the international markets, Walmart reported revenue growth of 7.1% for Q3 2023. In the coming years, international market growth is likely to remain robust. The reason is Walmart’s growing presence in China and India.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Baxter International, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.068 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Baxter International has an ROCE of 6.8%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. See our latest analysis for Baxter International roceIn the above chart we have measured Baxter International's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Baxter International's ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Baxter International, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 6.8% from 10% five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.What We Can Learn From Baxter International's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Baxter International. However, despite the promising trends, the stock has fallen 28% over the last five years, so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Baxter International (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

For this massive airplane, you can really chuck it around if you have to.""Designed in the late 1960s to meet demand for mass travel, the world's first twin-aisle wide body jetliner's nose and upper deck became the world's most luxurious club above the clouds.But it was in the seemingly endless rows at the back of the new jumbo that the 747 transformed travel.""This was THE airplane that introduced flying for the middle class in the U.S.,"" said Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith.""Prior to the 747 your average family couldn't fly from the U.S. to Europe affordably,"" Smith told Reuters.The jumbo also made its mark on global affairs, symbolising war and peace, from America's ""Doomsday Plane"" nuclear command post to papal visits on chartered 747s nicknamed Shepherd One.Now, two previously delivered 747s are being fitted to replace U.S. presidential jets known globally as Air Force One.As a Pan Am flight attendant, Linda Freier served passengers ranging from Michael Jackson to Mother Teresa.""It was an incredible diversity of passengers. People who were well dressed and people who had very little and spent everything they had on that ticket,"" Freier said.Story continuesTRANSFORMATIONALWhen the first 747 took off from New York on Jan 22, 1970, after a delay due to an engine glitch, it more than doubled plane capacity to 350-400 seats, in turn reshaping airport design.""It was the aircraft for the people, the one that really delivered the capability to be a mass market,"" aviation historian Max Kingsley-Jones said.""It was transformational across all aspects of the industry,"" the senior consultant at Ascend by Cirium added.Its birth become the stuff of aviation myth.Pan Am founder Juan Trippe sought to cut costs by increasing the number of seats. On a fishing trip, he challenged Boeing President William Allen to make something dwarfing the 707.Allen put legendary engineer Joe Sutter in charge. It took only 28 months for Sutter's team known as ""the Incredibles"" to develop the 747 before the first flight on Feb. 9, 1969.Although it eventually became a cash cow, the 747's initial years were riddled with problems and the $1-billion development costs almost bankrupted Boeing, which believed the future of air travel lay in supersonic jets.After a slump during the 1970s oil crisis, the plane's heyday arrived in 1989 when Boeing introduced the 747-400 with new engines and lighter materials, making it a perfect fit to meet growing demand for trans-Pacific flights.""The 747 is the most beautiful and easy plane to land ... It's just like landing an armchair,"" said Dickinson, who also chairs aviation maintenance firm Caerdav.AGE OF ECONOMICSThe same swell of innovation that got the 747 off the ground has spelled its end, as advances made it possible for dual-engine jets to replicate its range and capacity at lower cost.Yet the 777X, set to take the 747's place at the top of the jet market, will not be ready until at least 2025 after delays.""In terms of impressive technology, great capacity, great economics ... (the 777X) does sadly make the 747 look obsolete,"" AeroDynamic Advisory managing director Richard Aboulafia said.Nevertheless, the latest 747-8 version is set to grace the skies for years, chiefly as a freighter, having outlasted European Airbus' double-decker A380 passenger jet in production.This week's final 747 delivery leaves questions over the future of the mammoth but now under-used Everett widebody production plant outside Seattle, while Boeing is also struggling after the COVID pandemic and a 737 MAX safety crisis.Chief Executive Dave Calhoun has said Boeing may not design a new airliner for at least a decade.""It was one of the wonders of the modern industrial age,"" said Aboulafia, ""But this isn't an age of wonders, it's an age of economics.""(Reporting by Valerie Insinna and Tim Hepher; Editing by Alexander Smith)]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Skyworks Solutions is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$8.9b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Skyworks Solutions has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Skyworks Solutions compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Skyworks Solutions here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of Skyworks Solutions' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 30%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Skyworks Solutions' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 28% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.If you want to continue researching Skyworks Solutions, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Talks between Pfizer and China's government health insurer bogged down over price, and the drug is only covered by China's broad healthcare insurance plan until late March.Analysts say they have based their 2023 Paxlovid sales estimates primarily on public details of announced deals, with a token amount of estimated China sales from before the country dropped the Zero-COVID policy.Their current estimates for over $10 billion in 2023 Paxlovid sales is less than half the $22 billion Pfizer is expected to report for 2022, according to Refinitiv data. Growth in China could help offset expected declines elsewhere as many governments have built inventories of the two-drug treatment.Pfizer will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Tuesday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman has forecast about $8.7 billion in global sales for Paxlovid in 2023, including $1.9 billion from the developed world outside of the United States, Europe and emerging markets, he said in an email, adding that he is hoping for more information.""Given the opacity around access and broader availability in China, it is very difficult to model or forecast potential revenues from this product in the country,"" he said.Billions of dollars in Paxlovid sales could be at stake for Pfizer.Using treatment rates in other developed countries as a guide, UK data firm Airfinity forecast that total demand for outpatient COVID-19 treatments in China will reach 49 million courses over the next five months. The firm said around 23.5 million courses of Paxlovid would need to be administered over that period to keep the country's intensive care units from becoming overwhelmed.Story continuesStill, some outside experts question whether China has the capacity to buy and deploy Paxlovid in the places that need it now. A prominent Chinese government scientist said earlier this month that 80% of China's 1.4 billion population had already been infected, while 60,000 people have died.Pfizer's tiered pricing structure sets the Paxlovid cost based on a country's economy. The U.S. government, for example, has paid over $500 per course. Media reports suggest that the current price per course in China is 1,890 yuan, or around $280.But China has been asking to pay less. CEO Bourla has said China - the world's second biggest economy - is seeking a lower price than has been offered to lower middle-income countries.Pfizer declined to provide pricing details. Government documents from Brazil - an upper middle-income country - show that Pfizer asked for $250 per treatment course there.Even without a deal to sell Paxlovid broadly in China, the company can still sell it there on the private market.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said there is a lot of private wealth in China to support a higher price with direct purchases by patients.China is ""probably the only region that we're modeling a year-over-year increase in 2023"" for Paxlovid, Conover said.(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pfizer PFE / BioNTech BNTX, Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:FDA Panel Endorses Simplification of Covid-19 StrategyOn Jan 26, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) unanimously recommended moving toward a uniform vaccine strain composition for all COVID-19 vaccine doses (whether as primary series or booster).The FDA intends to harmonize the strain composition of all COVID-19 vaccines, despite the vaccine being mRNA-based developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna or protein-based vaccine developed by Novavax. It also recommended simplifying the immunization schedule for the administration of these vaccines.The VRBPAC suggested that, based on available immunogenicity and effectiveness data, the bivalent vaccines fulfill this criterion. Data from multiple studies conducted by vaccine developers have suggested that bivalent vaccines improve antibody response compared with monovalent vaccines.In the United States, the currently authorized bivalent vaccines contain an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.The approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines have different compositions and immunization schedules. This has led to multiple complexities regarding using the vaccine, thereby leading to complications in vaccine administration and uptake. For instance, the vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, Modernaand Novavax must be administered as two-dose series for the primary regimen, while J&amp;J’s COVID vaccine only requires a single dose administration. The vaccines developed by Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech also have different dosing regimens for different age groups. Hence, there is a need to simplify the current COVID-19 vaccination regimen.Story continuesThe committee believes this simplification could be achieved by designing an age- and risk-based immunization schedule. The VRBPAC members suggested administering a single dose to the general population who have already been immunized and additional doses to individuals who are either at high risk or are yet to be immunized.While Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna already have authorized bivalent vaccines for use in individuals aged six months and older, Novavax has stated that it requires six months to produce a new version of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine designed to match circulating COVID-19 variants.In addition, the VRBPAC also considered proposals to adopt an annual COVID vaccination schedule similar to that adopted in the case of influenza vaccines. However, the FDA committee could not arrive at a decision due to a lack of available data supporting this proposal. The VRBPAC plans to meet later this year to discuss the same.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Compared to the instantaneous gratification of a quick Venmo or Zelle payment, checks are a much slower exchange of funds.See the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023Find: GOBankingRates’ Best Neobanks 2023More: GOBankingRates’ Best Online Banks 2023However, while this process is a slower form of payment, it is still commonly used today by landlords, contractors and real estate agents. Additionally, for people without internet access, having a checkbook is a necessity. Still, though writing a check remains a trusty method of taking care of expenses, this old-school technique is currently overshadowed by newer and faster online payment options.According to a recent survey conducted by GOBankinrRates, 45% of Americans have not written a check in the last year. In light of this data, let’s take a closer look to find out what alternative methods Americans are using to exchange money.45% of Americans Didn’t Write a Check in 2022While writing checks may be less popular than it used to be, 55% of Americans still wrote a check in the past year. According to our survey, in the past year, 15% of Americans wrote a few checks a month, 12% wrote less than six checks, 23% wrote a check once a month and 5% wrote more than 12 checks.While many Americans did not write checks last year, the practice was least popular for those under 54. Our survey results showed that 43% of those aged 18-24 did not write a check this past year, along with 49% of those aged 25 to 34, 47% of those aged 35 to 44 and 49% of those 45 to 54. While the practice might be dwindling, many Americans in the 55 and over age group still write a few checks check a month — with 24% in the 55 to 64 age group and 25% in the 65+ in this age group reporting this.On the other hand, some age groups reported writing a single check a month in 2022 — 28% percent of 18-24-year-olds and 24% of those over 65 fell into this category. In contrast, only 17% of those in the 45 to 64 age bracket reported once-monthly check-writing.Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?Why Check Writing Is Becoming RareToday’s digital landscape is affecting how everyone is handling their money as the exchange of finances is shifting to a more virtual sphere and the need for physical checks is dwindling.“Besides the odd property tax bill or service person who only takes checks and credit cards; electronic payments can handle everything else,” said Jay Zigmont, PhD, CFP and Founder of Childfree Wealth. “It may not be about using apps or fancy tools, but just using basic credit cards and EFTs (electronic funds transfers).”How Americans Are Exchanging Money TodayIf you have never written a check before, the thought of writing down numbers on a slip of paper and trusting the money gets into the right hands can feel like a risk — especially with the instantaneous, more-secure money-transfer methods available today.Often, payment apps such as Venmo and PayPal require biometric screening of your face or finger to authenticate money transfers. They also restrict users from re-entering their security details and feature buy-in options for extra risk protection. These added details to trusted payment apps are leading many users to opt into the digital sphere and away from paper money methods.Most Popular Payment Apps in 2023PayPal, Venmo and Zelle continued to take the digital payment sphere by storm in 2022 and are the front-runners for payment apps in the new year.PayPalWith 432 million users at the end of 2022, PayPal is the largest online payment processing site worldwide, according to Statista.

Even if the economy takes a downturn, the buildup of customer demand from the last two years should keep stock low, making it a year of good pricing and profitability.Car Prices ""Ain't Coming Down Any Time Soon""On January 23 CNBC's auto and airline industry reporter, Phil Lebeau, discussed his take on new car prices and why he thinks they will not be coming down any time soon. Lebeau noted that ""the latest data from J.D. Power, which cracks average transaction prices, shows that in January there was a very slight decline from the record-high in December"". Phil Lebeau thinks that the auto market has record-high new car prices and also made a note of the fact that carmakers' inventory levels are still the same as they were in November. Here are some comments from CNBC's auto reporter:""North American production currently running below the expected demand level. That production right now- about third and a half million vehicles. Demand by the way, most believe is about fifteen million vehicles to be sold this year. So you still have more demand than production...Next week we hear from General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). They will report their Q4 (2022) results and a big focus on the conference call will be their perspective on both inventory and transaction prices, as well as profit margins and how they may be squeezed if there is a bit of a price war.

99,05cfdc49-7d1a-3300-a784-2b9a58eb3f63,TGT,2023-01-30,Does Target (NYSE:TGT) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-target-nyse-tgt-healthy-110150616.html,1675076510,STORY,['TGT'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Target What Is Target's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of October 2022, Target had US$16.6b of debt, up from US$12.8b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$1.01b in cash leading to net debt of about US$15.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Target's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Target had liabilities of US$23.8b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$20.8b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.01b in cash and US$1.35b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$42.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Target has a huge market capitalization of US$77.6b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).We'd say that Target's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.1), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 10.8 times, makes us even more comfortable. Importantly, Target's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 45% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Target's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Target produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 58% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewTarget's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered cast it in a significantly better light. For example its interest cover was refreshing. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Target's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

It reinforces measures implemented last year after several buyers skipped out on payments for oil, which provides most of the South American country's income.After taking the helm, Tellechea launched an extensive audit of supply contracts, according to a written order to PDVSA seen by Reuters.His order froze loadings, even pushed some vessels away that had begun receiving oil, until the review was complete and sale contracts could be modified or ratified, according to internal documents and three people familiar with the matter.As of Jan. 27, a total of 28 vessels including 21 supertankers were waiting near PDVSA's ports to load some 45 million barrels of crude and fuel for exports. Another four ships had loaded but were waiting for authorizations to depart, according to vessel monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.The new terms narrow a wide variety of contract modalities to a few requiring prepayment of cargoes entirely in cash or allowing payment via goods and services to Venezuela, but they must be received before Venezuela will release the oil, according to the documents.PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.'SOLVE' ECONOMIC WOESPDVSA explained in a contract viewed by Reuters that cash prepayment puts the company ""in a favorable business position because it would secure income for the country that is essential to solve its economic situation.""The new models set deadlines of less than 30 days for completing bank transfers or settling outstanding debt balances.In cases of swaps where the related oil sale exceeds the value of the goods or services, Venezuela must receive any outstanding balance in kind before the state will assign the next cargo, one of the documents showed.Story continuesEven long-term buyers must abide by the new rules that require payment in full by cash before each oil delivery.So far this month, swap contracts with Cuba's Cubametales and Iran's state firm Naftiran Intertrade Co (NICO) were among the few in force.A contract with Chevron Corp for repaying debt was unaffected. PDVSA has continued to load Chevron-chartered vessels and discharge imports from the U.S. firm.A similar contract to repay debt to China with oil has continued, although the customer has faced more than 30 days of loading delays, according to shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.Since the suspension was imposed in early January, only one of PDVSA's list of new clients and intermediaries, Hangzhou Energy, has been authorized to resume loading following a 12-month contract extension agreed this week, according to the documents and one of the sources.Other contracts are in the final review and should be authorized soon, another source said.UNDER THE RADARBefore U.S. sanctions, PDVSA used to receive letters of credit as guarantees if buyers were cleared to become established customers, and payments were completed in 90 days. Audit mechanisms were suspended about two years ago as the sanctions forced out traditional clients who were replaced by little known intermediaries with no track record of oil sales.Some of those new intermediaries have faced court cases under accusations of corruption and embezzling.Following an increase in the number of oil cargo departures without proper compensation to PDVSA, the company last year demanded to be prepaid at least partially in cash or goods. But the measure had not fully stopped the furtive cargoes.Now, most of the proposed contracts imply a form of swap, so PDVSA pays with oil in return for the government receiving food, medicine or services, including home reconstruction and telecommunications equipment.The suspension has caught even PDVSA employees off-guard.""While contracts remain suspended, we have been told to register all exports in Excel sheets,"" instead of using PDVSA's contract administration system, a company employee said.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; Additional reporting by Mircely Guanipa in Maracay and Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Venezuela; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

The Nasdaq Composite made considerable gains on a broader tech rally, rising 4.3% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Significant economic indicators like the PCE Inflation index showed softening demand alongside cooling inflation. This raises hope among investors that the Fed will be taking these numbers into consideration before their February meeting, in which they are expected to announce the next interest rate hike. Fourth-quarter GDP also came in higher than expectations, indicating that the Fed might be able to attain a soft landing of the economy despite their stringent policy measures.Even as the earnings season remains mixed and the profit guidance is somewhat discouraging, there are clear signs emerging that inflation is on its way down and the economy is still resilient. This has created optimism among market participants about the central bank pushing interest rate hikes down to a possible 25 bps, as all eyes remain fixated on its February meet.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Bilibili, Rockwell Medical Soar Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Bilibili Inc.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals Air Products and Chemicals' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Based on the last dividend, Air Products and Chemicals is earning enough to cover the payment, but then it makes up 474% of cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 41.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 51% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAir Products and Chemicals Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.56 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $6.48. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.7% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Air Products and Chemicals has grown earnings per share at 14% per year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.In SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Air Products and Chemicals will make a great income stock. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Air Products and Chemicals is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The Global Social Media ETF is the most followed social media ETF (note that it does not include TikTok).What has Led to the Underperformance of Existing Players?For one, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is paying less attention to his lucrative social media business and instead investing valuable resources in what he sees as the future – the metaverse. Approximately 20% of Meta’s current investments are aimed at this project. While the bold bet has not panned out for Zuckerberg and Meta yet, he plans to stay the course.The other major factor leading to the underperformance in domestic social media platforms such as Instagram, Youtube, and Snap Inc’s Snap Chat platform is TikTok’s success.Chinese-based ByteDance launched TikTok in the United States in 2016, and since then, the platform has dominated. The app, which allows users to create and modify short-form videos, has caught on, especially with the younger generation. TikTok’s competitors have noticed. To win eyes back, Instagram has launched “Reels” and Youtube has created “Shorts” –aimed at users who prefer short, customizable videos like Tik Tok.Story continuesSnapChat, already in the short video space, has suffered the most from TikTok’s rise.National Security ConcernsThough TikTok is one of the dominant global social media players and shows little signs of slowing growth – other factors may play a significant role in the social media space moving forward. Concerns are growing that ByteDance is collecting unnecessary personal data on its users and possibly supplying it to the Chinese government (the biggest rival of the U.S.).Former President Donald Trump attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, but ultimately the app was able to remain active. The Biden administration struck down the potential Trump ban on TikTok but ordered a national security investigation.A Potential Catalyst for Domestic Social Media PlatformsEven with the failed TikTok bans of the past, momentum is growing for a new possible attempted ban. In the past year, FBI director Christopher Wray, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, and Senator Josh Hawley have called for a domestic TikTok ban. Meanwhile, several U.S. colleges have implemented their own bans (via WiFi) amid security concerns.Tuesday, Josh Hawley announced he would introduce a bill to ban the app. Investors who follow the social media space should keep a close eye on how the efforts to ban the app play out. If the app is ultimately banned, SNAP will benefit the most, along with META and GOOGL. Software giant Oracle, which supports TikTok via its cloud platform, would stand to lose.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

A combination of more disciplined management and new markets for its products — including 5G technology and cloud services — would ensure that companies delivered more predictable earnings.And yet, less than a year after memory companies made such pronouncements, the $160 billion industry is suffering one of its worst routs ever. There’s a glut of the chips sitting in warehouses, customers are cutting orders, and product prices have plunged.“The chip industry thought that suppliers were going to have better control,” said Avril Wu, senior research vice president at TrendForce. “This downturn has proved everybody was wrong.”The unprecedented crisis isn’t just wiping out cash at industry leaders like SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., but also destabilizing their suppliers, denting Asian economies that rely on tech exports, and forcing the few remaining memory players to form alliances or even consider mergers.It’s been a swift descent from the industry’s pandemic sales surge, which was fueled by shoppers outfitting home offices and snapping up computers, tablets and smartphones. Now consumers and businesses are holding off on big purchases as they cope with inflation and rising interest rates. Makers of those devices, the main buyers of memory chips, are suddenly stuck with stockpiles of components and have no need for more.Already, Samsung Electronics Co. and its rivals are losing money on every chip they produce. Their collective operating losses are projected to hit a record $5 billion this year. Inventories — a critical indicator of demand for memory chips — have more than tripled to record levels, reaching three to four months’ worth of supply.Story continuesSamsung looks to be the only one that will escape relatively unscathed, thanks to its heft and diversified business, but even the South Korean giant’s semiconductor division is headed toward losses. Investors will get a sense of the damage this week when the company reports quarterly earnings.“Chip equipment companies’ sales are plunging by around 30% to 50%. This is not a normal situation,” said Greg Roh, head of technology research at HMC Investment &amp; Securities.Shares in Samsung fell as much as 2.3% Monday morning, in its biggest intraday fall in 12 days. SK Hynix fell 1.6%.The industry is suffering from a unique combination of circumstances — a pandemic hangover, the war in Ukraine, historic inflation and supply-chain disruptions — that have made the slump much worse than a regular cyclical downturn.Micron, the last remaining US memory chipmaker, has responded aggressively to plummeting demand. The company said late last month that it will cut its budget for new plants and equipment in addition to reducing output. The rate at which the industry rights itself will depend on how quickly the company’s counterparts make similar moves, Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said.“We have to get through this cycle,” he said. “I believe the trend of cross-cycle growth and profitability is still in place.”Over in South Korea, Hynix has also slashed investments and scaled back output. The company’s inventory glut is partly the result of its acquisition of Intel Corp.’s flash memory business — a deal struck before the industry’s decline.All eyes are now on memory-chip king Samsung, which has thus far said little about the industry’s near-term prospects. The world’s largest maker of chips, smartphones and display panels is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by a call during which analysts are likely to question its capacity management plans.The Korean tech giant has typically continued to spend during downturns, hoping to exit them with superior production and higher profitability when demand picks up. This time around, the market has been betting the company will tighten its chip supply, lifting its stock price in recent weeks.Chip-manufacturing equipment maker Lam Research Corp. said last week that it’s seeing an unprecedented reduction in orders as memory customers cut and postpone spending. Executives at the company, which counts Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron as its top customers, declined to predict when such actions might help the memory market rebound.“We’ve seen extraordinary measures within the memory market,” Lam CEO Tim Archer said on a call with investors. “It’s at levels that we haven’t seen in 25 years.”It’s always been difficult for memory makers to handle spikes and troughs in demand. Bringing new factories online takes years and billions of dollars, so it’s hard to get the timing right.The risks have prompted companies in the industry to get more conservative. They’re more focused on profitability than trying to grow quickly and gain market share.That’s especially true for so-called DRAM chips, where the three dominant suppliers — Samsung, Hynix and Micron — are reducing supply, said Shin Jinho, co-CEO of Midas International Asset Management. The other major part of the memory market, NAND chips, is more fragmented and is set to go through a more severe battle as the many contenders fight for survival, he said.“The NAND market is experiencing fierce competition and the recovery will follow one quarter after the DRAM market recovery,” Shin said. “If the situation gets longer, eventually, we are going to see consolidation in the NAND market.”The memory industry had mergers during previous downturns, and this one may be no exception. NAND makers Western Digital Corp. and Kioxia Holdings Corp. are progressing in their deal talks, people familiar with the matter said this month. Still, the companies already manufacture jointly and thus a merger won’t necessarily lead to reduced output.The longer-term question is when customers’ demand will bounce back. China’s recent exit from Covid-related restrictions could be one catalyst to help the industry, as gadget makers will be able to bring manufacturing plants back to normal rhythm, said HMC Investment’s Roh.“There will be pent-up demand for gadgets as well,” he said. “Our view is that memory will recover in the second half.”Why Making Computer Chips Has Become a New Arms Race: QuickTake(Updates with share price reaction, analyst comment from eighth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street: We Want Lower Rates.

Those steep increases could drive restaurant margins 500 basis points higher when the burrito chain reports fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 7, according to BTIG analyst Peter Saleh.""Some consumers are likely to reduce or eliminate their visits given the above-average price hikes,"" Saleh wrote. But investors should tolerate a slight drop off in transactions because margins will still be ""significantly higher.""Record inflation last year forced restaurants to hike prices multiple times. Now, with costs falling, higher menu prices are catching up.An order of 20 bone-in wings at a Wingstop in Newark, New Jersey now costs $28.69 - $10 more than in 2019.Meanwhile, average wholesale prices for chicken wings in December had fallen to 89 cents per pound after peaking at $3.25 in May 2021, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.Story continuesPrivately held A&amp;W Restaurants projects its total cost of goods will rise just 2.4% this year, versus about 20% in 2022, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Bazner told Reuters.""There's increased confidence in 2023, maybe the inputs come down and consumer demand seems to be holding up,"" said Bank of America analyst Sara Senatore.Investors had been somewhat reluctant to think positive signs could persist, but they increasingly think the Federal Reserve will soften the blow of interest rate hikes on the economy, she said.(Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York; Additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements including predictions and estimates about our future performance. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. However, they are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures as adjusted.Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our press release today. Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for each of our contract functional specializations includes intersegment revenues from services provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended talent solutions and consulting operations. This is how we measure and manage these businesses internally. The combined amount of intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing its information for 2020 through 2022. For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our website, roberthalf.com.Story continues2022 was a very successful year across the entire Robert Half enterprise. We grew full-year revenues and earnings per share both by more than 12% and achieved new record levels for each. All of our major practice areas, contracts, permanent placements and Protiviti reached all-time highs over and above the very strong growth in the prior year. We enter 2023 optimistic about our ability to navigate the uncertain global macroeconomic environment and the tight labor markets around the world. For the fourth quarter of 2022, company-wide revenues were $1.727 billion, down 2% from last year's fourth quarter on a reported basis, but up 1% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share for the fourth quarter was $1.37 compared to $1.51 in the fourth quarter a year ago.Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $202 million. In December, we distributed a $0.43 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $47 million. Our per share dividend has grown 11.2% annually since its inception in 2004, the December 2022 dividend was 13.2% higher than in 2021. We also acquired approximately 800,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million. We have 3.8 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on invested capital for the company was 39% in the fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.Michael Buckley: Thank you, Keith. Hello, everyone. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.727 billion in the fourth quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, fourth quarter talent solutions revenues were down 1% year-over-year. U.S. talent solutions revenues were $964 million, down 2% from the prior year. Non-U.S. talent solutions revenues were $264 million, up 5% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 317 talent solutions locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 18 countries outside of the United States. In the fourth quarter, there were 61.2 billing days compared to 61.7 billing days in the same quarter one year ago. The first quarter of 2023 has 63.3 billing days compared to 62.4 billing days during the first quarter of 2022.Billing days for the remaining three quarters of 2023 will be 63.3, 63.1 and 61.1 for a total of 250.8 billing days during the year. Currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year revenues by $39 million, $27 million for talent solutions and $12 million for Protiviti. This negatively impacted our year-over-year overall revenue growth by 2.2 percentage points, 2.1 percentage points for talent solutions and 2.4 percentage points for Protiviti. Contract talent solutions bill rates for the quarter increased 7.8% compared to one year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by functional specialization, currency and country. This rate for the third quarter was 9%. Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti.Global revenues in the fourth quarter were $499 million, $401 million of that is from business within the United States and $98 million is from operations outside of the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global fourth quarter Protiviti revenues were up 4% versus the year ago period, with both U.S. and non-U.S. Protiviti's up by 4% on an as-adjusted basis. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 89 locations in 29 countries. Company-wide fourth quarter public sector revenues were $83 million, of which $60 million was reported by Protiviti and the balance reported by talent solutions. Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year public sector revenues by approximately $3 million during the quarter.Full-year public sector revenues were down approximately 8% or 3% adjusted for currency. Turning now to gross margin. In contract talent solutions, fourth quarter gross margin was 39.9% of applicable revenues compared to 39.8% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago. Conversion revenues or contract to hire were 3.7% of revenues in the quarter. Our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 12.7% of consolidated talent solutions revenues versus 12.4% of consolidated talent solutions revenues in the same quarter one year ago. When combined with contract talent solutions gross margin, overall talent solutions gross margins were 47.5% compared to 47.2% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago. For Protiviti, gross margin was 27.2% of Protiviti revenues compared to 28.7% of Protiviti revenues one year ago.Woorking, Teamwork, OfficePhoto by Emma Dau on UnsplashAdjusted for deferred compensation related classification impacts, gross margin for Protiviti was 28% for the quarter just ended compared to 29.3% one year ago. Moving on to SG&amp;A. Enterprise SG&amp;A costs were 31.6% of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 30.8% in the same quarter one year ago. Adjusted for deferred compensation-related classification impacts, enterprise SG&amp;A costs were 30.4% in the quarter just ended compared to 29.7% one year ago. Talent solutions SG&amp;A costs were 38.9% of talent solutions revenues in the fourth quarter versus 37.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted for deferred compensation-related classification impacts, talent solutions SG&amp;A costs were 37.2% for the quarter just ended compared to 36.2% one year ago.The higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus one year ago had the effect of adding 0.2 percentage points to the quarter's adjusted SG&amp;A ratio. We ended 2022 with 9,300 full-time internal employees in our talent solutions divisions, up 5% from the prior year. Fourth quarter SG&amp;A costs for Protiviti were 13.6% of Protiviti revenues compared to 12.9% of revenues in the year ago period as operating expenditures returned to more normalized levels. We ended 2022 with 11,700 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 2.4% from the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $174 million. Adjusted for deferred compensation related classification impacts, combined segment income was $199 million in the fourth quarter.Combined segment margin was 11.5%. Fourth quarter segment income from our talent solutions divisions was $127 million with a segment margin of 10.3%. Segment income for Protiviti in the fourth quarter was $72 million with a segment margin of 14.4%. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27% up from 24% in the same quarter one year ago. The higher tax rate for 2022 can be primarily attributable to higher non-deductible expenses in 2022 as well as lower stock compensation deductions due to the company's stock price. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $1.018 billion and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 53.1 days. Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and so far in January, all adjusted for currency and billing days.Contract talent solutions exited the fourth quarter with December revenues down 6% versus the prior year compared to a 1% decrease for the full quarter. Revenues for the first two weeks of January were down 7% compared to the same period one year ago. Permanent placement revenues in December were down 1% versus December of 2021. This compares to a 2% increase for the full quarter. For the first three weeks of January, permanent placement revenues were down 23% compared to the same period in 2022. We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into January. But as you may know, these are very brief time periods. We caution reading too much into that. With that in mind, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenue, $1.685 billion to $1.765 billion, income per share $1.10 to $1.20.The midpoint revenues of $1.725 billion are 5.4% lower than the same period in 2022 on an as-adjusted basis. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: For revenue, on a year-over-year as adjusted basis, talent solutions, down 7% to down 12%. Protiviti, up 6% to up 9%, overall, down 3% to down 7%. Gross margin percentage: contract talent, 38% to 40%; Protiviti, 24% to 26%, overall, 39% to 41%. SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation classification impacts: talent solutions, 36% to 38%, Protiviti, 14% to 16%, overall, 30% to 32%. Segment income for talent solutions, 8% to 11%, Protiviti, 8% to 11%, overall, 8% to 11%. Tax rate, 27% to 28%; shares, $106.5 million to $107.5 million.2023 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $100 million to $120 million, with $20 million to $25 million in the first quarter. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.Keith Waddell: Thank you, Mike. Global labor markets remain tight and the demand for talent remains high despite continued economic uncertainty. Clients continue to hire, albeit at an even more measured pace, which has the effect of lengthening the sales cycle. Although recent metrics have come off their all-time highs, talent shortages persist in the United States, unemployment stands at 3.5%, a 50-year low, and remains even lower for those with a college degree where the rate is 1.9%. Job openings and quit rates remain elevated. Unemployment claims remain low. Similar reports across the globe also point to labor market resilience. Protiviti continues to have a very strong pipeline across an increasingly diverse offering of solutions.Both the regulatory risk and compliance practice and the technology consulting practice show particular strength. In 2022, Protiviti achieved record high revenues of nearly $2 billion, even while overcoming the wind down of very large financial services project and a shift in the trend of public sector engagements to projects more applicable to talent solutions. Demand for Protiviti services remains robust and is only mildly impacted by current economic conditions. While there remains volatility in the macroeconomic environment, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2023. We've successfully navigated many economic cycles each time achieving higher peaks. This was demonstrated by our ability to achieve the fastest recovery in our company's history following the COVID-19 downturn.We also continue to benefit from Protiviti's resiliency, which stems from its diversified solution offerings that are much less tied to the economic cycle. Longer term, we are encouraged by the growth and margin prospects from our ongoing focus on services related to talent with higher skill levels. These include management resources, full-time engagement professionals, managed solutions, Robert Half Technology and Protiviti. In addition, the structural shift to remote work, particularly for higher skills, creates new competitive advantage as it highlights our numerous strengths, including our global brand, office network, candidate database, and advanced AI-driven technologies. Also, our very successful investments in innovation and technology, which continue to position us to meaningfully improve both the digital and recruiter experience for our clients and candidates and the internal productivity of our staff.We remain committed to our time-tested corporate purpose to connect people to meaningful and exciting work and provide clients with the talent and subject matter expertise they need to constantly compete and grow. I could not be more proud of all our global teams, including talent solutions, Protiviti and corporate services professionals who put so much energy and dedication into our results this year. Their efforts made possible a record number of awards and accolades in 2022. Fourth quarter recognition included being named one of the best workplaces for parents and honored by Forbes as one of the world's top female-friendly companies. We are particularly proud of the recognition we continue to receive for our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.Now Mike and I'd be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.The markets are off to a rocking start this year, making this a bizarre time to be an investor.Bizarre primarily because stocks are logging gains (see Tesla up 44% YTD), and yet the view from Corporate America could not be more different than what the stock market is saying right now.Sure, the old saying on Wall Street is that stocks often ""climb a wall of worry."" And maybe that's what is happening in January. But honestly, is anyone paying attention to the economic data (beyond inflation) or the ongoing earnings season?""Yield curve Inversion, contracting M2 and PMIs, soft homebuilder and trucking surveys, and falling leading economic indicators all present a conundrum to [Federal Reserve Chairman] Jay Powell,"" Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel noted recently. ""While the soft landing vs. recession debate has intensified ahead of the Fed [meeting] on Feb. 1, there is reason to believe that recession is likely in the second half of the year.""And here are some earnings season data out of FactSet:69% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise for the fourth quarter, which is below the five-year average of 77%.S&amp;P 500 companies are beating EPS estimates for the fourth quarter by 1.5% in the aggregate, which is below the five-year average of 8.6%.The blended earnings decline for the fourth quarter for the S&amp;P 500 is -5.0%. If -5.0% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the first year on year drop reported by the index since the third quarter of 2020.Miserable reads on the health of Corporate America. Guidance has generally been poor as well: Just take a gander at the skimpy forecasts put out by 3M and Sherwin-Williams last week.Story continuesA modified Tesla Model X drives in the tunnel entrance before an unveiling event for the Boring Co.

(NYSE:NI) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 6.4% on the 17th of February to $0.25, up from last year's comparable payment of $0.235. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.4%. View our latest analysis for NiSource NiSource's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, NiSource's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 11.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 55% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.92 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.94. Dividend payments have grown at less than 1% a year over this period. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. NiSource has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 15% per annum. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.Our Thoughts On NiSource's DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think NiSource's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think NiSource is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, NiSource has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Capital One Financial's shares before the 3rd of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 17th of February.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.40 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Capital One Financial has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of $117.58. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Capital One Financial can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Capital One Financial is paying out just 13% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Capital One Financial has grown its earnings rapidly, up 37% a year for the past five years.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Capital One Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 28% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Capital One Financial an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Capital One Financial more closely.So while Capital One Financial looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Capital One Financial that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Here are all of this past week's most significant analyst rating changes, covered first on InvestingPro. Sign up for comprehensive, rapid-fire coverage of market-moving analyst moves.Lululemon cut to UnderperformRespected research firm Bernstein downgraded a popular traded name, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), to Underperform and added a $290 PT to the equity.The firm sees expectations for LULU from investors being reset commenting, ""expectations vs. reality gap has been our biggest concern this past year. Now, with no more pent-up demand, a more cautious consumer outlook, and negative margin mix shifts, earnings growth will decelerate materially and we expect the multiple to follow.""Shares of LULU slid 1.5% Tuesday on the downgrade and traded lower throughout the rest of week, closing the week off fractionally at $310.85.Alaska Airlines holds firm against downgradeAs the market got hotter and hotter all week, Wolfe Research came out with a negative note Friday on Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK), downgrading the stock to Peer Perform and cutting the entire U.S. airline sector to Market Underweight.Citing a key airline metric, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM), the boutique research outlet commented, ""... ALK is seeing the biggest deceleration in TRASM among the airlines in 1Q and thus is counting on the biggest re-acceleration in TRASM the rest of the year. ALK's competitive capacity trends are also accelerating in 1Q (on a y/y basis).""The downgrade had minimal impact as the U.S. airlines were strong all week, and ALK was no exception: Friday saw only a marginal loss and shares finished the full week up 1.4%.Norfolk Southern slips despite rating bumpDeutsche Bank on Thursday upgraded Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) to Buy with $266 price target due continuation of a prior thesis that was/is ""intrigued with the company’s new operating plan, which combined with a clear sense of urgency from new CEO Alan Shaw had potential to show tangible improvement in the coming months.""Story continuesThe global investment bank noted average train speeds for NSC are up 16% and the railroad company is adding train and engine employees along with efforts to attract new operating talent.Oddly enough, NSC tumbled on the upgrade amid the impending large-scale uncertainty stemming from the central banks as they decide on whether to keep the rate-hike velocity stable or ease off the pedal a bit. NSC shares, which had begun to fall Tuesday, took another sharp drop Thursday and ended the week at $238.81 - down 6.1% from Monday's open near $255.Upgrades for Philip Morris and PTCBulge bracket bank Goldman Sachs came out last week in support of Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) with an upgrade to Buy and a $120 price target.The bank is expecting the tobacco manufacturer to capture investors from three things: ""(1) a broader &amp; more aggressive global rollout of ILUMA; (2) an accelerated RRP innovation pipeline as PM combines technologies from its acquisitions of both Swedish Match and Fertin with its own R&amp;D capabilities to create next generation reduced risk products that push PM into new markets, increase usage occasions and accelerate conversion from combustible cigs; and (3) further price segmentation of iQOS, which is key to penetrating lower-income markets globally and increasing new user acquisitions.""Shares of PM popped on the Wednesday upgrade, closing the session up 2.1% at 103.42 before ending the week at $103.76.And Keybanc on Monday upgraded PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) to overweight with a $155, commenting, ""...we are upgrading PTC to Overweight on our view that the Company could be one of the best FCF growth stories over the next three years.""The analyst sees PTC carrying a free cash flow valuation of 29x, compared to 32x for the group.Shares rose strong in the session and finished the week up 1.8% from Monday's open.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingProRelated ArticlesLululemon stock slashed: The week's 5 biggest analyst callsIndia's Adani hits back at Hindenburg, insists made full disclosureIndia's Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man in eye of a storm]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, Intuit Inc. INTU, Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, Aflac Inc. AFL and W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Costco, Intuit and SchlumbergerThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Costco Wholesale Corp., Intuit Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Costco Wholesale have gained +1.2% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry’s gain of +3.1%. The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.These factors have been helping it register impressive sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects the company to register a 3.8% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 6.6% revenue growth.This outlook accounts for the businesses’ ability to navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Story continuesIntuit's shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-22.8% vs. -17.4%). The company is witnessing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds that might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.Nevertheless, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive.Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. The Zacks analyst expects Intuit’s revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Intuit here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Schlumberger’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+44.9% vs. +36.4%). The company is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the firm is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.Higher oil prices are aiding its overall business. SLB reported strong fourth-quarter results driven by strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. It made significant progress in its sustainability initiatives in 2022. SLB expects its Transition Technologies portfolio to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Schlumberger here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Aflac Inc. and W.W.

154,b7d25c7b-1b06-31b4-b7c4-3bf6ff787de1,DVA,2023-01-30,Should You Think About Buying DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-davita-inc-nyse-123832163.html,1675082312,STORY,['DVA'],"[While DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at DaVita’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for DaVita What Is DaVita Worth?Good news, investors! DaVita is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 10.76x is currently well-below the industry average of 20.95x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that DaVita’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will DaVita generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 5.3% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for DaVita, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since DVA is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DVA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DVA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Be aware that DaVita is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis and 1 of those is potentially serious...If you are no longer interested in DaVita, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

155,6d352f02-1d05-3600-8591-3ee8ee9e75b1,SRE,2023-01-30,7 Utility Stocks That Will Be Big Winners in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-utility-stocks-big-winners-143025519.html,1674743425,STORY,"['SRE', 'EIX', 'OGE', 'NEE-PR', 'YORW', 'D', 'DUK']","[When faced with economic uncertainty, investors should turn their attention to utility stocks to buy. Hardly an exciting arena, these critical service providers literally keep societies running. Cynically, this sector benefits from a simple harsh reality: bad things erupt when people flip the switch and nothing happens.Further, utility stocks thrive on insulation from the trade-down effect. When consumers face financial woes, they don’t always cut their spending cold turkey. Rather, they trade down their purchases until they reach an agreeable equilibrium between quality and pricing. However, no alternatives (save for going off the grid) exists for public utilities: you’re either getting your services or you’re not.Ultimately, then, this sector provides an attribute that so many seek today – predictability. With that, below are the utility stocks that will be big winners in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSRESempra Energy$158.98DUKDuke Energy$101.42DDominion Energy$62.32OGEOGE Energy$39.03YORWYork Water$45.76EIXEdison International$67.53NEENextEra Energy$76.59Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs one of the largest energy networks in North America, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) commands extraordinary relevance among utility stocks. For starters, you can look at the company’s consumer base of more than 40 million people. More importantly, Sempra owns a considerable geographic advantage. Covering Southern California, you really can’t operate in a more desirable part of the country.Combining an international borderline with a warm-sea port, the lower half of the Golden State is a veritable gold mine. And because of that, consumers – no matter how much they complain about Sempra – will find a way to pay up. It’s either that or move to Idaho (something that Idahoans would prefer Californians not do).Better yet, analysts for the most part appreciate SRE as one of the utility stocks to buy. Currently, Wall Street experts rate Sempra a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target implies a potential upside of 8%. When combined with the company’s forward yield of 2.89%, SRE makes for an enticing idea.Story continuesDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) represents a powerhouse name among utility stocks, in this case covering much of the east coast. According to its website, Duke’s electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.Similar to Sempra Energy above, Duke also enjoys a geographic advantage, particularly in terms of millennial migration patterns. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, young people from pricey metropolitan areas looked to more rural regions for lower costs of living. However, the Covid-19 crisis accelerated these financial concerns, thereby speeding up migration among younger age cohorts. With regions like the Carolinas attractive to millennials, Duke is positioned where the money will be.Currently, covering analysts rate DUK as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $107.64, implying almost 7% upside potential. Notably, Duke carries a forward yield of 3.98%, making it one of the more attractive utility stocks to buy.Dominion Energy (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is a power and energy firm supplying electricity in parts of its home state and the Carolinas. As well, it supplies natural gas to parts of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Per its website, Dominion serves nearly 7 million customers.To be fair, D stock hasn’t exactly been a great performance, especially compared to other utility stocks. For instance, in the trailing year, Dominion shares gave up nearly 20% of equity value. That said, the fundamentals of millennial migration patterns bode well for the company. As an example, millennials have flocked to Georgia, in particular Atlanta. Many of the other states that Dominion covers also attract young workers and families.Admittedly, Wall Street analysts rate Dominion as a consensus hold. However, their average price target implies an upside potential of 10%. Combine this with the company’s forward yield of 4.24% and you have a solid case for utility stocks to buy.OGE Energy (OGE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, OGE Energy (NYSE:OGE) is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for electricity in its home state and western Arkansas. Presently, OGE commands a market capitalization of $7.68 billion.While not the most exciting idea in the capital market, OGE more than holds its own against other utility stocks. In the trailing year, shares gained over 3%. To be sure, shares traded in a choppy manner throughout much of 2022. And while analysts aren’t exactly in love with the company – rating it a consensus hold – their average price target implies a potential upside of 6%.True, it’s not a blistering target. However, the company carries a forward yield of 4.32%. In addition, it enjoys 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will surely not want to give up on. Finally, on a fundamental level, OGE is undervalued, trading at a trailing multiple of 8.25 (below the sector median of 16.6). Thus, it’s worthy of consideration for utility stocks to buy.York Water (YORW)A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.Source: HQuality/ShutterStock.comTaking a dive into the smaller side of utility stocks, the Pennsylvania-based York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) is an investor-owned public utility that provides water and wastewater management solutions. It serves an estimated population of 190,000 through approximately 66,000 service connections across 48 municipalities. While definitely not the most invigorating example within the utility sector, for slow-and-steady reliability, it’s hard to beat.As well, York Water offers a small piece of American history. Per its public profile, the company carries the distinction of being the oldest investor-owned utility in the nation. It also has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816. That’s quite a record, needless to say.Back to the present day, York could use some shoring up of its balance sheet. However, it also features excellent profitability metrics. For example, the company’s net margin of 31.64% ranks above 94% of the competition.Now, with a forward yield of 1.79%, York isn’t the most generous among utility stocks. Still, if you’re seeking a steady anchor, YORW deserves further investigation.Edison International (EIX)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comBased in Rosemead, California, Edison International (NYSE:EIX) represents a public utility holding firm. Among its divisions stands Southern California Edison, which is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., serving about 15 million people. Thanks to providing for the economic powerhouse of the nation, EIX performed well, gaining nearly 8% in the trailing year.Moving forward, Edison offers an attractive profile for investors seeking dependable utility stocks. First, Wall Street experts maintain generally positive views of EIX, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. Admittedly, their average price target of $70.71 (implying a 5.5% upside) isn’t that hot. However, the company makes up for this with a forward yield of 4.4%.Significantly, this ranks above the average 3.75% average yield of utility stocks. As well, Edison features 19 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status management will surely want to keep going.As an added bonus, EIX also pings as objectively undervalued. Currently, the market prices shares at 14 times forward earnings, below the sector median of 16.6 times.NextEra Energy (NEE)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, most of the electricity produced in this country stems from natural gas, nuclear energy, and coal. Barring dramatic innovations, this narrative might not change in our lifetimes. Still, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) would like to move the needle to the renewable spectrum of the energy value chain.As one of the biggest capital investors of clean and renewable energy infrastructures, NEE easily ranks among the most relevant utility stocks to buy. Better yet, Wall Street analysts unreservedly support NextEra. Not only do they rate shares a consensus strong buy, but it’s also unanimous among nine experts. As well, their average price target stands at $97.33, implying nearly 18% upside potential.To be fair, NextEra doesn’t offer the greatest forward yield among utility stocks at 2.06%. However, with a payout ratio of 50.19%, it’s likely a reliable form of passive income. Plus, the company is on a 29-year streak of consecutive dividend increases. Again, management won’t give that up without a fight.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As per the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the performance of several major global hedge funds, hedge funds as a whole had a decline of 4.25% in the previous year. Despite a 10.37% loss, hedge funds outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which had a decline of 19.4% in its worst year since 2008. Although hedge fund managers who invest in stocks and cryptocurrency faced difficulties, they still found opportunities to earn positive returns. According to HFR, macro hedge funds were among the best performers. The HFRI Macro Index, which tracks performance of macro funds, was up 9.31% due to positive returns from commodity-based, quantitative, and trend-following strategies.

Kenneth FisherKenneth Fisher is a billionaire American financial analyst, author, and the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a hedge fund with a stock portfolio worth $133.40 billion as of the third quarter of 2022. Ken Fisher’s top holding as of Q3 2022 is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), with the billionaire owning more than 59 million shares worth $8 billion, representing 6.13% of the total 13F portfolio. As of January 29, Ken Fisher’s net worth came in at $7 billion. Like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the top stock picks of famous hedge fund managers. Here is what Wedgewood Partners has to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Apple grew quarterly revenues +14% (foreign exchange adjusted) driven by +16% growth in iPhone revenues (also foreign exchange adjusted). iPhone revenue growth was particularly impressive because The Company is compounding on +47 growth from a year ago. Apple’s installed base is over 1.8 billion devices which helps drive a software and services business, which in turn has generated almost $80 billion of revenue over the past four quarters and is up +60% compared to calendar 2019 (pre-Pandemic). As we have highlighted in the past, Apple’s relentless focus on the development and integration between hardware (especially integrated circuits) and software, continues to add significant value for customers of their products and services. We expect this favorable competitive dynamic to continue for the foreseeable future.”14. Carl IcahnCarl Icahn is a billionaire American investor who also founded Icahn Enterprises, and is a majority shareholder of the conglomerate. Icahn is a legendary corporate raider, and his core investment vehicle is Icahn Enterprises. He also manages a hedge fund consisting of his own money and his largest stock position is Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP), comprising 288.5 million shares worth $14.3 billion, representing 67.51% of the 13F portfolio as of Q3 2022. Carl Icahn’s net worth as of January 29 stood at $18.5 billion, and he is one of the most famous hedge fund managers. Here is what CrossingBridge Advisors has to say about Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Icahn Enterprises LP, headed by investor Carl Icahn, is a diversified holding company with interests in investments, energy, automotive, food packaging, real estate, home fashion and pharmaceuticals. The investment segment derives revenues from gains and losses from investment transactions. Other operating segments, in most cases, are independently operated businesses obtained through a controlling interest.As of 2Q22, Icahn Enterprises had Indicative Net Asset Value of $6.6 billion, consolidated debt of $7.1 billion and total liquidity, comprised of cash, investment funds and revolving credit availability, of $7.2 billion. Moreover, as of the end of 3Q22, it had an equity market capitalization of $16.0 billion. Thus, we have no concern regarding credit quality. We have traded in and out of the IEP 4.75% senior unsecured bond, due September 2024, since it was issued in February 2020.In 3Q22, amidst the downdraft in the high yield market, we were able to purchase these bonds at a yield to maturity over 8.20%, very attractive for a 2-year note with such strong credit quality. Purchased at a discount, the bond would have an even higher annualized total return were the company to redeem it prior to September 15, 2023, when it becomes a current obligation. We expect to continue adding to this position opportunistically.”13. Stanley DruckenmillerStanley Druckenmiller is an American philanthropist, hedge fund manager, and investor. He used to be the chairman and president of Duquesne Capital, which he established in 1981. In August 2010, Druckenmiller closed his hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, for outside investors.

He is one of the most famous hedge fund managers on Wall Street. The largest stock in Pershing Square Capital Management’s Q3 2022 portfolio is Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Lowe’s is the second largest home improvement center in the U.S. The company has several competitive advantages including scale, distribution efficiencies, interconnected retail through stores/internet, excellent management, and a strong balance sheet.

Some of the stronger performers across our equity funds were those that could be classified as more economically sensitive in nature, bolstered by the market’s hope that central banks may not need to be as aggressive as feared in tightening monetary policy with the latest inflation prints having shown signs of moderation. This included companies such as footwear and apparel brand Nike, coffee machine manufacturer De’Longhi, and industrial equipment dealer Finning International. Other standout performers included health care giant Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) and specialty insurer Trisura Group, with both companies reporting strong results.”10. David EinhornDavid Einhorn is the founder and president of Greenlight Capital, a hedge fund with $1.4 billion in assets as of the third quarter of 2022. The hedge fund has generated a 15.4% net return since its establishment in May 1996. He gained fame during the financial crisis of 2008, by raising concerns about Lehman Brothers' financial statements and alleging that the investment bank was not transparent about its potential risks. Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) is the biggest position in Greenlight Capital’s Q3 portfolio, with nearly 17 million shares worth $361.5 million, representing 25.6% of the total holdings. Moon Capital made the following comment about Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“For portfolio management reasons, we sold our stake in LGI Homes during the fourth quarter (at a loss.) We continue to hold our shares in another homebuilder, Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK), a position in which we currently have an unrealized gain.The recent signs of what may be the early stages of a housing market downturn have many investors calling for a major housing correction on the order of that experienced in 2007. While there may be certain similarities to the last housing crisis as it relates to affordability, there are also some very major differences.In 2007, the housing market had experienced years of construction in excess of both historical averages and new household formation – the exact opposite of conditions today. There are a host of other differences, as well. Consumers have much better balance sheets today than they did in 2006, with homeowner equity currently at an all-time high. Unlike the last housing bubble, delinquencies remain near all-time lows, so the forced credit sales that compounded the problem in the last bubble should be far less of an issue. Another material difference is the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). Towards the end of the last housing boom, ARMs accounted for well above 30% of all mortgages. This created a ticking time bomb as rate increases flowed into higher payments. Today ARMs account for less than 10% of the U.S. mortgage market.Putting it all together, we think builders are in a much better position to ride out the near-term weakness in the housing market than they were during the previous cycle. At today’s prices, we continue to see opportunity in the homebuilding sector, despite the significant near-term headwinds. We also believe that the current housing correction is likely to be more regional in nature and that Green Brick, which operates largely in business-friendly, pro-growth markets, will significantly outperform its peers.”9. David TepperDavid Tepper is an American billionaire hedge fund manager who is the president and founder of Appaloosa Management. As of the end of the third quarter of 2022, Appaloosa Management has a portfolio worth $1.36 billion. As of January 29, Tepper’s net worth came in at $18.5 billion. Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest position in David Tepper’s Q3 portfolio, with 2.6 million shares worth $218.8 million. Alger Capital made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is America’s leading clean energy company, based on carbon-free production. The company is the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, governments, community aggregations, and a range of wholesale customers (such as municipalities, cooperatives, and other end markets) across the continental U.S., backed by approximately 32,400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Constellation produces nearly 10% of the nation’s carbon-free energy.Shares outperformed during the third quarter primarily due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law in august, the bill provides a nuclear production tax credit of approximately $43.75 per megawatt hour of energy generated. This credit favorably impacted earnings, resulting in an increase in Constellation’s share price.”8. Cathie WoodCatherine Wood is an American investor, who is the founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK Investment Management. Wood established ARK in 2014 with the goal of presenting active stock portfolios in an ETF format. Catherine Wood is a strong supporter of Elon Musk's Tesla.

ARK Invest has a Q4 2022 portfolio worth $11.5 billion, and Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) is the biggest position, with 16 million shares valued at $794 million. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Exact Sciences: EXAS shares declined on a disappointing recovery in Cologuard screening due to COVID. Despite continued revenue growth from Precision Oncology and COVID testing, and Cologuard screening revenue growth of 30%, COVID restrictions limited access to physicians’ offices for the company’s and its Pfizer Joint Venture sales force as well as causing a severe drop off of in-person wellness visits.In the last year, Exact has also pivoted the company significantly from its single cancer screening tests (Cologuard for colon cancer and Oncotype for breast cancer) to multi-cancer screening through its Thrive acquisition, and to minimal residual disease and recurrence monitoring through its Ashion and Tardis acquisitions. Through this pivot, Exact has tripled its market opportunity from $20 billion to $60 billion.”7. Steven CohenSteven Cohen is the founder of Point72 Asset Management, with a Q3 2022 portfolio worth $25 billion. In 2020, Cohen purchased the New York Mets for $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive sale of an MLB team in history. Steven Cohen has a net worth of $17.5 billion as of January 29. Point72 Asset Management’s largest holding is Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), with the hedge fund owning 1.67 million shares worth $448 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) was the leading contributor among several biopharma names, boosted by positive, pivotal clinical data for its next-generation Alzheimer’s treatment Lecanemab. In a pivotal trial, the drug proved safe and efficacious in slowing progression of Alzheimer’s disease.”6. Ray DalioRay Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which has a portfolio of $19.75 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. To ensure the continuation of Bridgewater after his departure, Dalio shifted the company into a partnership in 2018 and gave a larger ownership stake to the employees. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is the largest holding of Bridgewater Associates, with 6.61 million shares worth $835.20 million. In addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a popular stock pick of famous Wall Street money managers. Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, let's say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:15 Countries with the Largest Uranium Reserves in the World20 Biggest Nonalcoholic Beverage Companies in the US25 Countries with the Lowest Corporate Tax Rates Disclosure: None. 15 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 77% during that time. So we're hesitant to put much weight behind the short term increase. But it could be that the fall was overdone.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for Macerich Macerich isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.Over half a decade Macerich reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 6.5% for each year. While far from catastrophic that is not good. The share price fall of 12% (per year, over five years) is a stern reminder that money-losing companies are expected to grow revenue. It takes a certain kind of mental fortitude (or recklessness) to buy shares in a company that loses money and doesn't grow revenue. Fear of becoming a 'bagholder' may be keeping people away from this stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Macerich, it has a TSR of -66% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 7.7% in the twelve months, Macerich shareholders did even worse, losing 13% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 11% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

GWW.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Costco, Intuit and SchlumbergerThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Costco Wholesale Corp., Intuit Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Costco Wholesale have gained +1.2% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry’s gain of +3.1%. The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.These factors have been helping it register impressive sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects the company to register a 3.8% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 6.6% revenue growth.This outlook accounts for the businesses’ ability to navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Story continuesIntuit's shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-22.8% vs. -17.4%). The company is witnessing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds that might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.Nevertheless, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive.Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. The Zacks analyst expects Intuit’s revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Intuit here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Schlumberger’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+44.9% vs. +36.4%). The company is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the firm is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.Higher oil prices are aiding its overall business.

It made significant progress in its sustainability initiatives in 2022. SLB expects its Transition Technologies portfolio to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company.

167,d575f662-60cb-31a0-8cbf-20b2c24a2afc,REGN,2023-01-30,Dupixent® (dupilumab) Approved by European Commission as the First and Only Targeted Medicine Indicated for Eosinophilic Esophagitis,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dupixent-dupilumab-approved-european-commission-060000655.html,1675058400,STORY,"['REGN', 'SNY', 'SNYNF']","[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Approximately 60% of patients aged 12 years and older treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly in the pivotal trial experienced histological disease remission; patients also significantly improved their ability to swallow compared to placeboDupixent is now an option for the approximately 50,000 adults and adolescents living with severe uncontrolled eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union (EU)Dupixent now approved to treat five diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation in the EUTARRYTOWN, N.Y. and PARIS, Jan. 30, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. EoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. With this approval, Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S.“This latest approval establishes Dupixent as the only targeted medicine specifically indicated for eosinophilic esophagitis in the European Union. Dupixent is also the only biologic shown in pivotal trials to help patients achieve histological remission, reduce difficulty swallowing and improve health-related quality of life – all of which are crucial to reducing the burden of this debilitating disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Since its first approval, Dupixent has redefined the treatment of certain chronic diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation and is now indicated for five conditions in the European Union. We remain committed to investigating Dupixent’s potential in additional diseases in which IL-4 and IL-13 may play a key role.”Story continues“The impact of EoE on a patient’s daily life cannot be overstated – the narrowing and scarring of the esophagus can make something as simple as eating a painful and distressing experience, and may lead to choking and food impaction,” said Naimish Patel, M.D., Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “With this latest approval for Dupixent, adults and adolescents in the EU suffering from the chronic and often debilitating symptoms of EoE now have the first and only targeted treatment option clinically proven to reduce both esophageal inflammation and damage, as well as improve swallowing ability, pain and health-related quality of life.”The EC decision is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts (Part A, B and C). Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (Part A n=42; Part B n=80) compared to placebo (Part A n=39; Part B n=79) for 24 weeks. Part C (n=188) observed patients who had continued on or switched to Dupixent from Parts A and B for an additional 28 weeks.Dupixent patients in Parts A and B, respectively, experienced:An approximately 10 times higher rate of histological disease remission (60% and 59%), a co-primary endpoint, compared to placebo (5% and 6%).A 69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms compared to 32% and 41% with placebo. Disease symptoms were measured using the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), on which Dupixent patients experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to a 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo, a co-primary endpoint. Swallowing improvement was observed as early as four weeks.A greater than seven-fold reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline (-3.2 and -4.5 points) compared to placebo (-0.3 and -0.6 points).Nominally significant improvements in swallowing-related pain and health-related quality of life, as well as less frequent non-swallowing symptoms.Histological disease remission, swallowing improvement and reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings were consistent with the overall population in patients who were uncontrolled, or not responsive to or not eligible for swallowed topical corticosteroids. Longer term efficacy in Part C was similar to results observed in Parts A and B.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications were injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, arthralgia, oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in EoE patients treated with Dupixent (n=122) compared to placebo (n=117) included infections (32% vs. 25%). An additional adverse reaction of injection site bruising was reported in the EoE trial. The safety profile through 52 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at 24 weeks.About Eosinophilic Esophagitis EoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE, swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid, a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow, forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. In the EU, about 50,000 adults and adolescents live with severe uncontrolled EoE. About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe three-part Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. All patients had previously not responded to proton pump inhibitors, and, across Parts A and B, 74% of patients were previously treated with swallowed topical corticosteroids.At 24 weeks, the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission, defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf).Additional endpoints included abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale), swallowing-related pain (DSQ pain score), health-related quality of life (EoE Impact Questionnaire [EoE-IQ]) and frequency of other non-dysphagia symptoms (EoE Symptom Questionnaire [EoE-SQ]).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adolescents and adults with EoE, Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every week. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prurigo nodularis and EoE.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

168,e5147d28-274a-3b9f-a66c-41b760b09a28,UNP,2023-01-30,Can Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Maintain Its Strong Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-corporation-nyse-unp-140015569.html,1675000815,STORY,['UNP'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:58% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.58.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Union Pacific has a superior ROE than the average (26%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnion Pacific's Debt And Its 58% ROEUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.74. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Union Pacific may not be the best stock to buy.
